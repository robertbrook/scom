	<div class='title'>ACCESS FOR REPAIRS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 232, in page 16, line 22, leave out from' 'executing" to end of line 23 and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"any repairs therein or to adjoining property which the landlord is entitled to execute or obliged to execute or afford reasonable facilities of access."</p></blockquote>
I understand that my honourable Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr Doran) intends to give us the benefit of his thoughts on the amendment. Perhaps the Minister, who is slightly in advance of my honourable Friend, could say what he has to say on the amendment first.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would require the tenant to provide access to an adjoining property as well as his own house for the purpose of carrying out repairs. I believe that it is unworkable. It would be unfair to require a tenant by law to afford his landlord access to property adjacent to his own, over which he would probably have no control. It would be wrong to put into statute something which would impose an impossible obligation on him. Therefore, I suggest that the amendment should not be pressed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for not being here to move the amendment. In the circumstances, I shall ask my honourable Friend to seek to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have now had an opportunity to confer briefly with my honourable Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South, who has reminded me of the precise terms of the amendment. I share the misgivings which he has expressed privately and the Minister has expressed more publicly. I take the Minister's point that it would not be clever to create a statutory right for access to a tenant's home in connection with repairs to an adjoining property. Having explored that interesting little point—I can think of few better ways of allowing the digestive process to be completed after dinner—I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a commendable clause in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>748</span>
many ways. It will especially commend itself to the honourable and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn) because it is brief; contains only four lines. It must be about the shortest clause in the Bill. However, it is now one word longer, largely thanks to the honourable and learned Gentleman, because the word "reasonable" is now rightly inserted into it. My honourable Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths) was right to move the amendment. It is important to establish that access to people's homes should be allowed only on a reasonable basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was interesting to see how the Minister wilted as soon as he found himself being attacked by the honourable and learned Member as well as by Opposition Members. This axis between ourselves and the honourable and learned Gentleman could turn out to be fruitful as time goes on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards the generality of the clause, we all accept and understand the principle that it is important to grant a landlord access on a reasonable basis to carry out repairs to the property. I fear that it is less likely that landlords will beat down doors in their enthusiasm to repair and upgrade properties. That is one of our main anxieties about the Government's approach to the expansion of the private rented sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister keeps telling us how small the private rented sector is and how it has withered away in recent years in Scotland almost to non-existence. He keeps quoting figures, and one wonders why the Government put such faith in the expansion of the private rented sector. If ever there was a case of building on failure, this must be it. The private rented sector is probably beyond human aid as a major provider of private rented accommodation in Scotland, for a range of reasons which we have dwelt on at length.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of the poor record of many private landlords in keeping their properties up to a reasonable standard, the clause may turn into a dead letter in too many cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some years ago, the Government legislation to give tenants a right to have repairs to their homes carred out. That may be more relevant than the right of access in the clause. I hope that the Minister can give us an assurance that tenants will be sure of getting their homes properly improved, where there is substandard or dangerous wiring on unsatisfactory plumbing, or where the houses are damp or cold or fall below the tolerable standard for a range of reasons. Tenants should have a right to have that essential work carried out so that they can live in tolerable conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What assurance will there be that that work will be done? The Minister keeps telling us about the brave new future of assured tenancies that he is setting up. What assurance is there that tenants who are faced with the insecurity and high rents that are part and parcel of the Government's prescription in the Bill will be able to have essential repairs carried out in good time and to a proper standard by the private landlords about whom the Minister is so enthusiastic? Of course we support the principle of this essential clause, but I fear that in far too many cases it could turn out to be a dead letter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause is a paragon of simplicity and brevity. It provides that a tenant must give the landlord access to the property to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0491">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>749</span>
carry out repairs. I am sure that the honourable Gentleman does not disagree with that. If he is saying that he would like a requirement written into the Bill that landlords should keep their properties up to a reasonable standard, perhaps he would table a new clause so that we can consider the matter again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister is giving an undertaking to support a new clause of that nature, we can probably do business with him. But I was specifically asking him whether tenants will have a right to ensure that repairs are carred out. This is the Government's Bill; it is not our Bill. If we had any say in the matter, this wretched Bill would never have seen the light of day. We are not at all happy about assured tenancies, short assured tenancies, Scottish Homes or any of the other daft ideas that the Government are putting forward in the Bill, but the Minister claims to be bringing forward a package of legislation which will form the basis of landlord and tenant relations in Scotland for the foreseeable future. I think that the Opposition have made it clear that this is a false prospectus and a bad prospectus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Minister, or perhaps one of his predecessors, in an earlier Scottish housing measure, established a right for local authority tenants to have their homes repaired. Is there any such guarantee for private sector tenants?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can answer the honourable Gentleman by saying that we shall publish a consultation paper on private sector improvements and repairs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not another one?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we want advances, we must go into these matters with great thoroughness, to find out the extent of the problem and tackle it in the most effective way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The requirement on landlords would depend on the conditions of the lease, but schedule 10 of the 1987 Act imposes repairing obligations on all landlords.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The principle of this Administration in Scotland seems to be to legislate first and ask questions later. A whole list of consultation documents connected with this legislation is flying around, on finance for housing associations and on other aspects of the Bill, and the Minister has just told us—I dare say it is not news—about yet another consultation which is taking place on the problem of repairs not being carried out in the private sector. He came to the House with legislation to expand the private sector, and he now says that this consultation process is going on. What could be more fundamental, after the questions of security and rents, than the right to live in a reasonable standard of accommodation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister wants me to give way, I shall happily do so, but he seems to be snowed under with bits of paper again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the honourable Gentleman complaining about consultation or the lack of it? At times he complains about the lack of consultation and at other times he says that he does not approve of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>750</span>
A tenant will have three rights in relation to repairs. The first is a common law right that the property must be kept wind and watertight; the second relates to repairs implied by schedule 10 to the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987, which imposes an obligation on landlords; and the third is the repairing obligation contained in the leases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am truly delighted that consultation is going on—let there be consultation by the bucketful—but I cannot see the sense of legislating first and then embarking on a consultation process about the legislation. That is standing logic on its head. If the Minister wants consultation, why not have it first and then, in the light of responses to it, start drafting the legislation and bringing it to the House? But the Minister seems to prefer to do it the other way round, which seems irrational but nevertheless consistent with what we have become accustomed to from the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are back to good old common law and the assurance that the tenant has a right to expect his landlord to keep the property wind and watertight. Given my constituency experience, I am not sure that that has always been the most efficacious way of ensuring that people's homes are kept in a reasonable condition. There are the implied repairs in schedule 10 to the 1987 Act, and again the Minister refers to the details in the lease of the property. We have already debated the duress under which a prospective tenant can be put when he is accepting and putting his name to a lease.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking mostly about people who are desperate to find accommodation for themselves and their families. We know that 200,000 people are on waiting lists for houses in Scotland and that 30,000 people became homeless in Scotland last year. This is not exactly a buyer's market. If someone is offered a house, no matter what state it is in, he will be under a great deal of pressure to sign on the dotted line and will not be in a strong position to negotiate terms which ensure that proper repairs will be carried out. That is not a very satisfactory assurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see the Minister poring over the 1987 Act, perhaps to schedule 10. If he wants to say more about that, I shall be very happy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stress, in response to what the Minister said a minute or two ago, that Opposition Members are perfectly happy with the terms of clause 26. This is one of the few clauses in the Bill which we positively applaud and we want to see on the statute book. What worries us is that it is likely to be a dead letter—that the work will not get done and that the clause will not be worth much to tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We said a great deal in our earlier debates about the need for a house condition survey in Scotland. We tried to draw the attention of a reluctant Minister to the fact that house conditions in Scotland are not as rosy and of as high a standard as he seems to believe according to his own statistics. There is a lot of bloody awful accommodation in Scotland. The Minister acknowledged in an earlier debate that much of the worst of that accommodation is in the private sector. Therefore the track record of the people we are talking about in connection with the Bill is not very good.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to make sure that people living in rented
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0492">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>751</span>
accommodation have an enforceable right to see that that property is kept up to standard. The Minister has invited us to table a new clause or an amendment to establish that point. I find that a tempting proposition and we may do so on Report, but it would be useful if the Minister could give us in Committee, when we have more time to discuss such details, an idea of the Government's view in principle on that suggestion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my honourable Friend the Under-Secretary of State responds in his usual enlightened and reasonable way, would he care to wonder whether the honourable Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) has been reasonable in the way in which he has approached my honourable Friend's generous offer?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) may follow up his point, either by writing or by tabling a new clause, and we can debate it fully now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Gentleman made it clear that he agrees with the terms of clause 26 and what it stands for. There has already been one concession by the addition of the word "reasonable", which he advocated, so he cannot have any objection to the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want the minister to take this opportunity to say whether he thinks that a short assured tenant in a private let house in Scotland should have a clear, written, statutory right, as public sector tenants have, to have repairs to his house carried out. Will he accept, if I may borrow a cliché, that what is sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander? If public sector tenants have a statutory right to have repairs carried out, is there not an irrefutable case for establishing a similar principle for private sector tenants?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said earlier, tenants already have rights to ensure that repairs are carried out. I mentioned the rights of common law, the rights under schedule 10 to the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 and the repairing obligations in the lease. Earlier in our deliberations I made it clear that I would look carefuly at the proposals for a written lease and come back to that point later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to ask the Minister for clarification. He mentioned the rights under schedule 10 to the 1987 Act, which contains various obligations to repair. Paragraph 1, which is entitled "Obligations to repair", makes a landlord liable for keeping the house in all respects reasonably fit for human habitation. It then goes on to define that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In determining for the purposes of this paragraph whether a house is fit for human habitation, regard shall be had to the extent, if any, to which by reason of disrepair or sanitary defects the house falls short of the provisions of any building regulations in operation in the district."</p></blockquote>
I take it that that is the main obligation to repair to which the Minister is referring. If so, can he explain why, in the example given by my honourable Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe), a house in Glasgow occupied by a tenant has not had its wiring renewed for the past 40 years? Would that be possible under schedule 10 to the 1986 act?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>752</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are going rather wide of the business before us. We are dealing with clause 26, and both the Minister and the spokesman for the Opposition have stated their agreement with the clause. We are now beginning to talk about other matters, and it may be fruitful to pursue that hare on another occasion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will take your advice, Mr. Martin, and will follow the example of the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate having almost the last word on the clause. If refers to access for repairs, and by this time the Minister will have had a chance to check on repairs spending, especially the Housing Corporation budget, which I gave earlier, and will have been able to verify the figures that I gave him from the 	<i>Official Report</i> of 21 February 1987 at cols. 421 and 432. That was a series of figures and tables which showed that at this year's prices the increase in spending on housing associations was increased five times by Labour, and has gone up by less than 60 per cent. under the Conservatives. Given that the landlords requiring access—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are stretching the point here. It is a very small clause. As honourable Members have stated, it is only four lines in length, and now they are discussing tenancy. It would not be fair to start down that road.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept your ruling, Mr. Martin. In such a small clause of barely four lines, the fact that the Government are forced to make a significant concession shows that in other clauses and subsections where there is even more meat, the Government are probably making many more mistakes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have now had an opportunity to dwell on the provisions of section 60 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987, which I hope that you will appreciate, Mr. Martin, has a connection. I am concerned about cases where a landlord might not exercise his powers, duties and rights under clause 26. This could leave tenants, including a number of our constituents, in an extremely difficult predicament. The Act says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may by regulations make a scheme entitling a tenant under a secure tenancy, subject to and in accordance with the provisions of the scheme … to carry out to the house which is the subject of the secure tenancy repairs which the landlord is under an obligation to carry out."</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister say now whether he would contemplate an amendment to that provision, to extend that right to people with assured tenancies, as well as secure tenancies, and whether he would be prepared to introduce a scheme to extend rights to such tenants?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already answered the honourable Gentleman. If he tables a new clause or an amendment, it can be considered on its merits. He must come forward with the proposals which he suggested. It does not alter anything that we have said on clause 26, which is a clause that he and I support, and I saw him wink broadly a moment ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no law against Ministers answering hypothetical questions at this time of night, and I am sure that the Minister is quite capable of doing it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>EFFECT OF TERMINATION OF TENANCY OF
<br><br><!-- lb --> SUBTENANCIES WHICH ARE ASSURED TENANCIES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No.211, in page 16, line 31, leave out "determined" and insert "terminated". This is a more straightforward Government amendment than the last one, and is purely a drafting amendment to bring the wording of the clause into line with the rest of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was hoping that the Minister might have risen at this point. Clause 27 will stand a little examination and explanation. It deals with the
	<br><blockquote><p>"Effect of termination of tenancy on sub-tenancies which are assured tenancies".</p></blockquote>
This takes us back to the point about the inherently insecure nature of an assured tenancy, and the facts that an assured tenant who has a sub-tenant could lose his tenancy because of any of the grounds that we discussed earlier. It may not affect the individual who has the tenancy, but will plainly be serious for whoever lives in the premises.

I want to clear up the question of who has the right. Who is to have the limited protection that the Government are setting up under this legislation? Will it be the tenant—the person physically living in the flat or house with his family—or will it be someone else one stage removed? Will the Minister take this opportunity to take us through the effect of termination of tenancy on sub-tenancies which are assured tenancies? We are setting up a potentially complicated pyramid of tenancy relationships, and I wish to understand clearly what protection is being afforded to the people living in the properties which fall into this type of tenure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will describe exactly what the clause does. It ensures that a tenant and subtenant will each have independent security of tenure; so that if a landlord takes possession proceedings against his tenant, and secures a possession order from the court, only the tenant would have to leave. In those circumstances, the order would not apply to any sub-tenant, who would himself become the landlord's tenant. The clause provides that a possession order against a tenant will not apply to any sub-tenant, thus protecting the sub-tenant's position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that not only the assured tenant but the sub-tenant would have independent security of tenure. Can he help over a case where a landlord seeks vacant possession of the property under mandatory ground 3? That is where the landlord is in default of his mortgage and needs vacant possession of the property. That is exactly the example to which we have
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>754</span>
tried to direct the Minister's attention already. There could be a landlord company which is officially the landlord, where the landlord is in fact a sub-company of a bigger company to which he belongs, and it is merely a fiction that he had defaulted on his mortgage; in reality the sister company wants to regain possession of the property. We know that the assured tenant would be thrown out on those grounds, but will the sub-tenant, too?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ground 3 would apply to the tenant and the sub-tenant. I know that that is not the answer the honourable Gentleman wants, but that is the position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So both tenants will be evicted?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>9.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This clause mirrors the provisions of section 110 of the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984, with the exception that we mentioned previously. It appears from my reading of it to exclude all the mandatory cases under part I of schedule 5. Will the Minister confirm the position of those tenants who would be evicted under part I, subject to the reconsideration of various grounds that he has promised?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I read the clause as drafted, the sheriff has all the powers that are given him under clause 20(6) in relation to any action that is taken by the landlord to exercise certain discretion to extend or delay the operation of any action. That is how the current law operates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, clause 28 as drafted is made subject to the provisions of section 20. The sheriff has
	<br><blockquote><p>"the same powers with respect to adjournment, sist, suspension, postponement and otherwise as are conferred by section 20."</p></blockquote>
Clause 20(6) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This section does not apply if the sheriff is satisfied that the landlord is entitled to possession of the house on any of the grounds in Part I of Schedule 5 to this Act."</p></blockquote>
I may be incorrect—I shall be happy to be found incorrect—but that exclusion seems to apply in relation to any powers that the sheriff has relating to the restriction of diligence under clause 28.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>755</span>
I shall be interested to hear what the Minister has to say about that. If those cases are excluded, I would argue that they should not be, and that the discretion that the sheriff has in relation to rent should be extended to all the cases in part I, especially since, with reasonable foresight, we can see that the cases in part I will constitute the vast majority of those which come from the court.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This clause simply provides that a landlord can take no action to enforce payment of any rent due from an assured tenant except by process of law. As the honourable Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) said, it replicates section 110 of the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984. This is diligence for rent, not an action for possession. I think that that answers the honourable Member's point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know what the clause is for and what section 110 is supposed to do. The point that I made is that, as I read the clause, any tenant who falls within the terms of part I and who is evicted because a sheriff has no discretion because of the terms of clause 20(6), would not be entitled, because the sheriff could not exercise discretion, because of later diligence, to any degree on rent. Are all part I evictions excluded in terms of clause 28 or are tenants to be given the right to ask the sheriff to delay the diligence?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The notes on clauses state clearly
	<br><blockquote><p>"The sheriff's powers to delay or suspend authorisation for any such action by a landlord are to be the same as his powers to delay or suspend execution of an order for possession under clause 20."</p></blockquote>
If the honourable Member wants me to make further inquiries into the point that he has made perhaps he would say so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has answered my question. He is saying that under the terms of clause 20(6), the sheriff's jurisdiction is restricted. Perhaps I am not expressing myself clearly. There is a tremendous amount of inactivity among those advising the Minister. The point that I am trying to make is that there are exceptions in the operation of clause 20: all the tenants who are included in part I for eviction. Clause 28 simply gives the sheriff the same rights as are conferred by clause 20(6). Am I correct in my reading of the clause? Is the exercise of the sherrif's discretion under clause 28 restricted in the same way as under clause 20(6)?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman may be correct, but I will check and write to him in due course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important, because we are discussing whether the clause should stand part of the Bill. It is an important issue of principle. I should like the matter cleared up now. My honourable Friends expressed themselves fairly forcefully in the discussion on clause 20(6). I am sure that they want to do so now. It is important to have an answer. I would want to say more if the sheriff's discretion was restricted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 28 is perfectly clear. It says,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>756</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"otherwise as are conferred by section 20 above in relation to proceedings for possession of such a house."</p></blockquote>
One of the provisions of clause 20 is subsection (6), which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This section does not apply if the sheriff is satisfied that the landlord is entitled to possession of the house on any of the grounds in Part I of Schedule 5 to this Act."</p></blockquote>
I do not know whether the honourable Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) likes it, but in statute it could not be clearer that that is what is proposed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems to be clear to everyone except the Minister. I asked the question so that I could be clear. That is my understanding of it, too, but I want to be certain before we continue the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman is making a mountain out of a molehill. Clause 20(6) clearly excludes possession proceedings brought under the mandatory grounds in the schedule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has had several opportunities to say that. I am glad that he has expressed a view. In that case, it is important to make the point that those individuals will form the bulk of the tenants who are evicted because most of the cases that are now mandatory were previously subject to the sheriff's discretion. The discretion has been removed by clause 20(6). We now find that the sheriff's discretion—I agree with the Minister's interpretation—is removed in relation to the subsequent diligence. A distinction must be drawn between the landlord's ability to recover the possession—although Labour Members have not conceded the principle, they cannot win the vote—and the subsequent hardship that may be caused to tenants. As I understand section 110 of the 1984 Act—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am of a nervous disposition and do not like what my honourable Friend is saying. "Diligence" is a cosy-sounding term which means warrant sales. Is he suggesting that, to economise on the activities of sheriff officers, it will be possible to evict a tenant and remove his property on to the pavement and at the same time, on the same pavement, to carry out the warrant sale to sell his furniture to pay arrears of rent?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the point that my honourable Friend makes. The existing procedures would not allow that to happen because a certain time must elapse between the poinding and the warrant sale. But it is an interesting theory. The main area where tenants will be evicted in future will be under Part 1, so we are talking about the bulk of tenants who appear before the courts. The sheriff's right to exercise a discretion previously enjoyed under the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984 will disappear with the new assured tenancy and all these tenants will face eviction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, to heap on the misery, the Government now appear to be saying that, even with the diligence in respect of the rent, the sheriff cannot exercise the discretion which he can exercise at present in all these cases, even after he has been obliged to find that the tenants must be thrown on to the street. Even that discretion has gone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some respects, a landlord may lose out if the sheriff cannot exercise that discretion. The sheriff may say, "We
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0495">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>757</span>
will allow time to pay. We will allow you to settle into the new accommodation". In the new freedom of movement of tenants and landlords, that may not involve a great deal of rent because a tenant does not need to be much in arrears nowadays before he can be evicted. But the landlord can be assisted by the sheriff's involvement and the pressures which the sheriff can apply and the opportunities that he has of exercising his discretion and applying restrictions. That can operate in the landlord's favour because it is an encouragement to the tenant, for example, not to do a moonlight flit. But this would heap on the misery. I ask the Minister consider this seriously. I discerned uncertainty when I asked the question. I appreciate that I may have put it in a convoluted way, but it reflected my own uncertainty. When the landlord has recovered possession and may have a new tenant in the property, we appear to be heaping on the misery unnecessarily if the sole aim is to improve the housing stock and its availability in the private sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman's comments relate not so much to clause 28 as to the grounds for possession in the schedule, which we discussed earlier. The previous practice under the 1984 Act was to have many mandatory grounds, too, in which the discretion of the sheriff court was limited.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The mandatory grounds in schedule 2 of the 1984 Act are completely different from those that we are discussing. They relate to fairly specialised cases, no to what could be described as the general needs category in housing. They are all fairly specialised where they are required for the special needs of the landlord, and are less to do with fault. The faults or inadequacies of a special group of tenants that we tend to deal with in the courts are now shoved into the mandatory category. That is why I am pleading for some compassion from the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He is a hard man.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Aye, he is. We are heaping on the misery. There is no reason why the sheriff could not in the case of diligence be involved in the process to relieve and in some respects to help the landlords. I do not accept the need to push these people into the mandatory category, but if that decision has been made, we must accept it. But I do not see the need to follow that with the harshness of the diligence process, without any control by the courts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 367, in page 17, line 3, leave out "six" and insert "twelve".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>758</span>
	<p>9.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are dealing here with what has been described as a variant form of the short assured tenancy. It is an important strand of the Government's attempt to revive the private rented sector in Scotland. The Government's case is basically that the decline in the private rented sector is due to two main causes. The first is rent controls which, according to the Government, prevent property owners from receiving an adequate return on their investments. To put it plainly, landlords have not made enough profit from housing in Scotland in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second reason for the decline, according to the Government, is that the laws on security of tenure have made it impossible for property owners to regain possession of their property when they wish to do so. That has deterred property owners from letting their properties on temporary lets. The Government seem to be saying that the landlord's right to exploit his property for profit has been diminished by the tenant's right to security of tenure. We are dealing with important issues and must look closely at this relatively short clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to bring the minimum duration of a short assured tenancy into line with the existing short tenancies in the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984. Section 9 of that Act states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(1) A protected tenancy created on or after 1st December 1980 is a short tenancy for the purposes of this Act where—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(b) the tenancy is for a period specified in the tenancy agreement of not less than one year nor more than five years;"</p></blockquote>
The amendment argues that, since tenants will lose their right to a fair rent, they should at least retain the present security of tenancy. The concept of the short tenancy was introduced by the Tenants Rights (Scotland) Act 1980. Under that Act, the absolute guarantee of repossession for the landlord was balanced by a fair rent reflecting the reduced security of tenure for the tenant. It was possible to identify a balance between the landlord and the tenant in that Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister defended that balance during the Second Reading debate when, referring to the Tenants Rights (Scotland) Act, he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Indeed, I recall a whole night in Committee when we fought for the rights of council house tenants to be established on the statute book. This Bill is a logical development of the proposals in that Act. Those policies have been highly successful."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 11 January 1988; Vol. 125, col. 110.]</p></blockquote>
If they have been highly successful and if the Minister spent a night fighting for them, why is he now overturning the rights for which he fought back in 1980 in the House? The balance between landlord and tenant is now decisively upset and tilted in favour of the landlord. Where possession was secured for a year, it will now be secured for only six months, and where there used to be a right to a fair rent, there is now a vague provision that the tenant can apply to the rent assessment committee for determination of the rent. But that determination will be based on an assessment of the market value of the tenancy, whatever that may mean.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult to see any justification for tilting the balance towards the landlord, unless one wishes to abandon all pretence at trying to maintain a balance. The
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0496">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>759</span>
Scottish Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux said that it is
	<br><blockquote><p>"unconvinced of the need for short-assured tanancies, given the evidence we have that what our clients desire is the opportunity to rent safe, affordable, secure 	<i>homes.</i> A rental period of six months is far too short to provide a reasonable tenancy period"—</p></blockquote>
for their clients or indeed for any tenants. The Minister must confront the contradictory trap that he has laid for himself. He said that he fought all those years ago to win those rights for tenants, and now he introduces a Bill to take those very rights away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No.427 takes the position to the next logical stage, if it is logical that any short assured tenancy should have a maximum as well as a minimum term. Currently, a short tenancy under the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984 cannot be for a period exceeding five years, and it would seem to be a misnomer to call a tenancy of 10 years a short tenancy. However, the current legislation allows a tenancy to be given for 10 years and still be considered a short tenancy if conditions relating to the service of notice that it is to be a short tenancy are fulfilled. At the end of the 10 years, the landlord can automatically gain possession on the ground that the 10-year tenancy is a short tenancy. If that is passed unamended, there will be no incentive for a landlord to let his tenancies under anything other than a short assured tenancy. In that way, he will maximise his position at the expense of the tenant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must face that problem. He cannot sustain the argument that, by undermining the position of tenants under short assured tenancies, reducing it from one year to six months and moving the maximum from five years to almost anything, he will attract the private sector in any significant way. It will merely lead to exploitation by people who would have been involved in the private rented sector anyway. Although he does not speak much about it, I believe that the Minister is genuinely concerned to protect the rights of the tenants. He can do that by maintaining the present condition, which he claims he fought for and won six or seven years ago. It is up to him to fight and win it again tonight and to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should explain that we are not talking about short tenancies but about short assured tenancies, which are similar but not identical. The honourable Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) asked what incentive landlords would have for assured tenancies; he thought they would all go for short assured tenancies. One obvious reason why I imagine that most landlords would go for assured tenancies is that short assured tenancies have less security of tenure, so automatically the rents would be lower. I should certainly expect that to be borne in mind in negotiations for the lease.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have listened carefully to the honourable Gentleman's arguments for setting the lower limit for short assured tenancies at 12 months and an upper limit of five years, but I have not been convinced. The aim of the short assured tenancy is to give people the chance to let their house for a precise period with an absolute guarantee of regaining possession when they want. Many people in that position will want to let for less than a year, and that is why we settled on six months as the minimum period. Equally, many people may wish to let for more than five years but still have a legitimate need for a firm
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>760</span>
date when they will recover possession. I concede that the word "short" may be slightly inappropriate in this context, but I hope that honourable Members will not accept the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The term "short" in this context is obviously absurd. I can envisage many circumstances in which a so-called short assured tenancy will turn out to be considerably longer than a straightforward assured tenancy. We can safely predict that that is likely to be the norm if the Committee and Parliament are daft enough to enact this legislation. Apart from anything else, it is standing the language on its head to describe that type of tenancy as a short assured tenancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am surprised to hear the Minister suggest that the short assured tenancy is likely to be less popular than the assured tenancy. I should have thought that it had considerable attractions to landlords who wanted to exploit tenants. We shall come to the question of rent presently and can challenge his suggestion that there will be more effective rent control in the context of short assured tenancies. I think it is unlikely. Landlords are likely to find the so-called short assured tenancy formula more attractive because there is even less security for the tenant within that framework than under the assured tenancy. My honourable Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) is on the right lines with the amendment to change the criteria from six to 12 months.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my honourable Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion). It is difficult for me, as someone who has advised landlords, drawn up leases and found my way round the Rent Acts, to understand what disincentives there are for a landlord to use a short-term assured tenancy as opposed to any other form of tenancy, because it has all the ideal attributes that a landlord could want. The major one is that it gives no security to the tenant. As I read the whole of clause 29, the tenant is entitled to his first six months and then by tacit relocation the same insecurity, the same tenancy, will continue and continue unless one or other of the parties becomes involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is misunderstanding, or not taking the trouble to learn about, the real facts of housing in Scotland. In certain parts of Scotland, for example, in my area of Aberdeen, there is great pressure for housing, and all the cards are stacked in favour of the landlords. In other parts of Scotland it may be different. In Glasgow there may not be the same pressure. But my experience in Aberdeen is that there is a great demand, and it is difficult to understand why any landlord would want to use any other form of tenancy. The tenant has no say in terms of rent or of security of tenure, and it is a type of tenancy that can subsist indefinitely without any controls. If the term comes to an end the landlord is simply entitled to say, "Out you go". The tenant can be faced with that every six months, regardless of how long he or she has occupied the premises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am mystified by the Minister's statement that rents will be lower. Who is to control? Who is to say? The Minister believes that the market will dictate, but in those areas where the market dictates there is a demand for that sort of housing, usually in the city centre and usually in property that is less modern. People are prepared to take
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0497">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>761</span>
such lets for all sorts of reasons, and there is a demand for it in some areas of the cities. His statement holds no water. This is the ultimate loophole for landlords, because they can ignore all other forms of rent regulation; they can ignore interference from the rent assessment committee, from rent officers and from the courts. They have no need of them because they can create a tenancy in perpetuity on their terms and their terms alone.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman wants to know what the incentive is for a short assured tenancy. I have already told him and other honourable Members that the incentive is the guarantee that the owner will get the house back within a specific period.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know what the incentives are. My point is, what is the incentive for the landlord to go for any other type of tenancy when he can create a tenancy in perpetuity, knowing that he can get the tenant out any time he likes, and without the restrictions of the Rent Act?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I explained earlier that an assured tenancy would have, on average, a higher rent. There will be variations from one area to another, depending on demand, but the rent for an assured tenancy would be higher. In the case of the short assured tenancy, because security of tenure would be limited to the specific terms, the rent would automatically be lower. I understand that the honourable Gentleman would prefer a 12-month minimum and five-year maximum. That seems more because existing legislation for short tenancies has those limits than any positive reasons to do with increasing the provision of houses for rent. I do not believe that setting the minimum period at six months with no maximum will revolutionise the provision of rented housing. Setting the minimum period at six months with no maximum will not revolutionise the provision of rented housing, but it would make a welcome contribution to increasing that supply. On that basis, I am not prepared to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's answer is not only disappointing but disgraceful. He has consistently disappointed us. We have heard a lot about concessions but the critical matters the Minister makes no concessions, and this is a very critical matter indeed. The Minister makes statements with no evidence to justify them. He says that rents will be lower under short assured tenancies than under assured tenancies without giving any evidence for that statement. He asks us to believe him because he hopes that that will be the case, not because he has any evidence that it will be. The Opposition do not believe him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's naivety knows no limits. He asks us to believe that his only concern is to look after the interests of landlords who legitimately want to let their houses for short periods and then to repossess them—people who go abroad as part of their jobs, for instance. The Minister knows that commercial landlords are not so naive as he, and that they will always look to their self-interest. Their self-interest is to let their properties on short assured tenancies rather than on assured tenancies. The balance of advantage is decisively with them under the short

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment made:</i> No. 212, in page 17, line 10, after "tenancy", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"(or, where there are to be joint landlords under the tenancy, is served by a person who is to be one of them)"—[	<i>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 428, in page 17, line 11, after "tenancy", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"and is signed by both the landlord and the person who is to be the tenant and adopted as holograph;".</p></blockquote>
The purpose of the amendment is to formalise the service of the notice under clause 29. That notice specifies that the tenancy is to be a short-term tenancy. We have expressed concern in earlier debates that the Government appear to have little desire to encourage formality in the creation of tenancies in Scotland. The Minister has rejected amendments, for example, that would have provided for a written lease—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I accept that the Minister said. I should not be so churlish. I have made some strong points and I take the

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>763</span>
firm view that there is a real incentive here for landlords in Scotland to forget about any other form of tenancy and to go for the short assured tenancy, because there is no real disadvantage left for them in that form of tenancy. It gives absolute control. It is essential that some protection be provided for the tenant. It is a protection also for the landlord that the notice should be first in writing and then formalised in the way suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The notice could be formalised in several ways. The amendment proposes that the notice should be adopted as holograph, which would make it a formal document according to the law of Scotland. I should not demur if it were a requirement that it be sent by recorded delivery, as long as the service of the notice was formalised in some way. There is a severe danger, as I said earlier, of increasing the risk of litigation of both parties to the contract unless we enforce some formality. Obviously we hope that the decent, caring and good landlords, of whom there are many in Scotland, will continue the present practices and prepare leases and written contracts. The amendment simply offers protection for both sides. On the landlord's side, there is the assurance that the document served on the tenant is legally binding under Scots law, and on the tenant's part a due formality is recognised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am conscious that a provision in the clause allows the Secretary of State to prescribe the form of that notice. But notwithstanding that, I do not think that the amendment is out of the way and I recommend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not understand the necessity for the amendment. The common law of Scotland, which applies to leases of more than one year, is not superseded. Were it to be so, the amendment would be entirely defective. What it should provide is that the lease is signed by or on behalf of the landlord and the person who is to be the tenant and, assuming that it is not holograph, may be adoped as holograph. If it were holograph, it could not be adopted as holograph, and it would exclude the possibility that an agent could act on one's behalf.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, the common law requirements of the proof of tenancy are not superseded by any proposal in the Bill. It is therefore superfluous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not demur from anything that the honourable and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn) said. That is why I stressed the formality, without relating it to the form of the amendment. The amendment has been proposed by Shelter, but the principle of formality is sound. As ever, I accept the points made by the honourable and learned Member for Perth and Kinross.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether Shelter adopted the proposed draft amendment as holograph. I hesitate to get involved in the argument between a Scots solicitor and a Scots advocate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not an argument, it is an agreement</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It started as an argument. I think my honourable Friend has just concurred with the honourable and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn). This confirms the point put to us by the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>764</span>
Law Society of Scotland in relation to part II, where it says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We find this part of the Bill to be particularly complex. It will we are sure, provide a fruitful source of litigation for both landlord and tenant."</p></blockquote>
I see my honourable Friend and perhaps even the honourable and learned Member for Perth and Kinross rubbing their hands at the prospect of the fruitful litigation to come in due course, but holograph or no holograph, my honourable Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) was making a perfectlyfair point that there is a need to formalise this type of notice. When I saw the honourable and learned Member for Perth and Kinross rising to his feet a minute ago I thought he might be rising to the challenge posed by my honourable Friend's suggestion that notices could be sent by recorded delivery. We went through that last week, when the honourable and learned Member for Perth and Kinross said that he often gets things by recorded delivery when he is not there, and someone signs for them but he has not received them. Nevertheless the fact that they have been delivered activates the whole process of the law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the sitting was suspended, I was talking about the delivery of holographs through the post by recorded delivery. My honourable Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South made the pertinent and fair point that notice under clause 29(1)(b) setting up an assured tenancy should not be sprung on a tenant or prospective tenant unawares, that all concerned should be positively aware of the terms, and that there is a clear need to formalise such proceedings, to ensure that all details are properly recorded and signed, and that the parties to the agreement can get appropriate professional advice about what is right and wrong. The parties should have properly signed copies of the documents so that they realise what are their respective obligations, duties and rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the terms of short assured tenancy in the Bill. My honourable Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South was right to put forward that principle. Inevitably, the honourable and learned Member for Perth and Kinross found a technical defect in the drafting of the amendment. That is not surprising since it was drafted by laymen in Shelter (Scotland) who may not have access to the professional legal advice that the honourable and learned Member could have given on the point. But the point of principle still applies: I hope that the Minister will accept that it is a fair point and that there is a case for tenants and landlords alike having access to written evidence of what their rights and duties are.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Member for Aberdeen, South wishes to ensure the formalising of the serving of the notice which must be served before the creation of a short assured tenancy. I listened with interest to the remarks of my honourable and learned Friend the Member for

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>765</span>
(Mr. Fairbairn). The amendment does not relate to leases so much as to notices under clause 29. I am glad to be able to tell the Committee that I accept the principle of the amendment. However, I should point out that the Bill already provides that the notice which has to be served before the beginning of a short assured tenancy should be prescribed by my right honourable and learned Friend the Secretary of State, so we could easily achieve the purpose of this by prescribing that the notice should be signed by both tenant and landlord.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am attracted to the idea of requiring the signature of the tenant, because then there can be no disputing the fact that the tenant has received the notice and, one must presume, understood it. I should say, however, that I am not yet absolutely convinced about the requirement that the notice should be adopted as holograph. This again brings in a strong flavour of legality and formality which we are anxious to avoid throughout part II. I am not sure that we should insist on a phrase whose significance will be understood by very few tenants and perhaps by not many landlords.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, although I have expressed those reservations, I repeat that I accept the intention behind the amendment—much to the surprise, I of the honourable Member for Aberdeen, South. All that I ask is for time to consider whether the amemdment is the best way of achieving that purpose, whether it would be sufficient to rely on the power to prescribe the notice and whether we are being more formal than we need be. Subject to that, we shall certainly do something which will have the intended effect. I hope that, given that undertaking, the honourable Gentleman will seek to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The night is young. If the Minister is feeling generous and willing to consider, he will have a spot of considering to do between now and Report, given some of his remarks. Nevertheless, that was a helpful suggestion. I had noticed the terms of subsection (2)(a), which provides for the Secretary of State, I presume, to prescribe a format for notices. The Minister is half a step in front of me, as I am not sure what procedures would be adopted for prescribing the format for such notices. Would it require a statutory instrument or could the Secretary of State simply give formal notice that that is the appropriate way to lay down the documentation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be by way of statutory instrument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can I take it that the Minister has given an understanding to consider—I put it no stronger than that—the case for making a statutory instrument which would require notice to be given in a prescribed format under subsection (2)(a), which would specifically enable both parties in the tenancy to sign the detailed documentation and have copies of it? The Minister, characteristically, and I suppose predictably, said that he thought it was important to ensure that the tenant was specifically bound by the terms of the lease. He will not be surprised to hear that Opposition Members are more anxious to ensure that the landlord is bound by the terms of the lease. If there are to be model leases and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>766</span>
notices, I hope that tenants will take advice from tenants' organisations such as the Citizens Advice Bureaux and Shelter, which specialise in advising tenants on their rights, to ensure that people do not sign away important rights which could later lead them and their household into serious trouble.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that we have made a little headway with the Minister. I think that I am satisfied, but perhaps my learned honourable Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South can advise me further on the merits of the Minister's assurance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Please may we have more tea breaks, Mr. Martin, if this is what they produce?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot demur at the Minister's suggestion. This matter seriously needs to be looked at. In those circumstances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 430, in page 17, line 21, leave out from "tenancy" to end of line 22.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment takes us a little further into the clause. At this stage, before we reach the ish of clause 29, I pay tribute to the parliamentary draftsman who has revived the charming term "ish" in the Bill, which I confess I have not heard in current usage in my constituency or anywhere else in Scotland. But I am always delighted to see good Scots terminology used in new legislation and I pay tribute to the anonymous parliamentary draftsman who found this gloriously brief term and put it into the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Tell us what it means.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought we could depend on the honourable and learned Gentleman to tell us what it means.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member --> I know what it means.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why did the honourable and learned Gentleman ask then? I understand that it means the conclusion or end of the lease or the tenancy, but perhaps the honourable and learned Gentleman can think of a better term, or even a Latin term, which would convey the same meaning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that, after the termination of a short assured tenancy, any new contractual short tenancy cannot be for less than six months and that it is made clear that in a new contractual arrangement a notice must be served. This is important, because we have already debated how long short tenancies should be. Having accepted that they are likely to end up being much longer than is intended in the Bill and that the term "short tenancy" is more a term of convenience for the landlord rather than having anything to do with the brevity of the lease, the Minister has resisted an amendment which would extend the normal term of a short tenancy to 12 months and we are stuck with this six-months' period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it appears from the way in which the final
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0500">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>767</span>
paragraph of subsection (3) is drafted that it should be possible for subsequent instalments of a short tenancy to be of shorter duration than the six months written into the Bill. Therefore, a statutory short tenant who had a six-month lease to start and was under the happy illusion that it would be possible to renew that for further six-monthly periods might find that the second instalment was only one month or two months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to delete from the clause a sentence which would allow for a new contractual tenancy entered into after the end of the initial short tenancy to be a short assured tenancy, even though it does not fulfil the normal conditions for a short assured tenancy of being for a term of not less than six months or having had a notice served stating that it will be a short tenancy. What we have here is the question, when is a short tenancy not a short tenancy, and the answer is, when it is an extension of a short tenancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Bill stands, this sentence seems to mean that after a short assured tenancy has reached its ish, if a new contractual arrangement is entered into, that new short tenancy could be for a period of two months or any other period less than six months, as after the end, or ish, of the initial short assured tenancy there is no requirement that a subsequent short assured tenancy should be for a term of not less than six months. That being so, it is untrue that all short assured tenancies will give a minimum of six months' security unless the landlord has grounds for possession such as would give him repossession as under assured tenancies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is complicated stuff, and I am grateful to our good friends from Shelter (Scotland) for briefing us on the details of the Bill. Nevertheless a serious point is made here which challenges the principle of the type of short tenancy which the Government are seeking to set up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The minimum of six months' security for short assured tenancies is guaranteed only for the initial period. After the first six months a new contract could be entered into giving a short assured tenancy of only one or two months, or perhaps even less. It would not be logical to argue that no landlord would give a renewed contract for only one or two months. Those who have experience of assisting tenants in different parts of Scotland know that all too many landlords would be only too willing to take advantage of any loophole, and this is a serious loophole that the Government are building into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be much to the advantage of a landlord to take advantage of such a loophole. Any new contractual short assured tenancy for a very short time would, if the landlord wished it, simply continue by tacit relocation if the landlord did not wish to repossess. Thus, by granting a tenancy shorter than six months the second time round, as it were, the landlord would keep his options open to repossess at any time by giving the required two months' notice, without having to wait until the end of a longer contractual period before initiating possession proceedings. Possession proceedings could be started at any time after serving the two months' notice. The amendment would ensure that all assured tenancies were for a minimum duration of six months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are challenging the Minister to demonstrate that he
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>768</span>
means what he says about short assured tenancies. My honourable Friends have made it plain that we do not think much of the prospect of having tenancies in Scotland that are as short as six months, and, as they will be so advantageous to private landlords, we fear that they will become common and bring about insecurity and all manner of difficulties for families throughout the land. It is bad enough to have a maximum duration of six months; it would be intolerable if the second stage of short assured tenancies were of even shorter duration. I hope that the Minister will view the amendment as positively as he viewed some of our earlier amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I confess that the purpose of the amendment was not clear to me when I first looked at it, and its present drafting would do no more than produce a doubt that subsection (3) seeks to remove. That subsection deals with the situation in which a short assured tenancy reaches its expiry date—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or ish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: —or ish, as the honourable Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) says, but continues either by tactic relocation, where neither the landlord nor the tenant does anything to terminate the lease, or by a new contractual tenancy with the same house, where the relationship of landlord and tenant is agreed upon. In other words, the original lease is being prolonged. The tenant will understand that he has a short assured tenancy, and it would make no sense of the landlord to be obliged to issue a notice informing the tenant of what he already knows. It all seems eminently reasonable, but it is not reasonable that both the landlord and—perhaps the most important—the tenant should be in doubt about the nature of the continuing or replacement tenancy, which is all that the amendment would achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Gentleman asked whether the short assured tenancy could be for less than six months, and the answer is "Yes". The landlord should be able to prolong the lease a little, and it does not matter if there is an initial grant of six months.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understood the Minister to say in earlier debates that the Government intended to create this new form of tenancy—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I emphasise what I said? The short assured tenancy can be for less than six months after an intial grant of six months. I want to stress that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly what worries Opposition Members and Shelter, who advised us on the drafting of the amendment. I understood that the purpose of the new short assured tenancies was to create flexibility in the housing system. I understood, too, that tacit relocation involved the continuation of a tenancy on the previous agreed arrangements. Therefore, I find it difficult to understand why there should be more flexibility for the landlord, when surely the intention was that the lease should continue on a six-monthly basis. That is now being removed. There is to be complete flexibility for the landlord. Not only will he be able to avoid all the encumbrances of the assured tenancy—the tenant's right
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0501">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>769</span>
to involve the rent assessment committee, the right to notice, and all the other encumbrances that, in the Government's view, restrict the operation of the private housing sector; he is now being given by Government the opportunity to bring the new tenancies down, virtually to a daily basis. There is no time limit. There is nothing to say how long it should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite all the criticisms that we have of the short assured tenancy as it now is, the tenant has at least six months—a definite period. Now the landlord can say, at the end of the six months, "I will give you a month", and then "I will give you two weeks" or "I will give you three months". There is no certainty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There should be a limit to flexibility. If there are rights, there must be obligations. I find it difficult to understand the Government's thinking. The pendulum tends to swing fairly slowly, and I understand why the Government want it to swing more towards the landlord. But this is a complete shift in emphasis and onus. It is difficult to understand why so much power is being given to landlords to the detriment of tenants, when the Government seemed quite happy to talk about six-monthly tenancies and the vitality that they would bring to the privately rented market. That is not what they are saying now. This is a one-off six months; thereafter it can be anything from one day to six months. I do not understand the rationale for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not good enough for the Minister to parrot his briefs that landlords need such flexibility. They have not needed it; they do not need it. The Minister tells us that in England there are only 3,000 out of 20-odd million tenancies, and I cannot see what advantage there will be to the Scottish housing market, except to weight the balance yet again very heavily and unfairly against tenants' rights.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland has confirmed our worst fears about the clause. Up to now we have given him the benefit of the doubt. I confess that I had assumed that it was the Governemnt's intention that repeat instalments of short assured tenancies would be of the same length as the original short assured tenancies. Six months in a lease is quite short enough, without making it any shorter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister seems to be confirming that end of the first six months is the conclusion of the lease—the absolute ish of the lease. Clearly, that is not satisfactory from the tenant's point of view, nor can it be satisfactory from the point of view of a responsible landowner. What relationship can there be between a landlord and tenant if the tenancy staggers on from week to week and month to month? There will be no security for the tenant and his family, because they wil have no idea when the landlord will spring the trap and put them out on the street. It will mean that tenants will not look after the property that they are renting. What is the point of decorating a house or flat if the tenant does not know whether he will be there a week later? What is the point of carrying out basic repairs?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>770</span>
Ingram) says. It is a recipe for property going downmarket and being abused.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard a great deal about neglected estates and property in the public sector. If ever there was a recipe for run-down property in the future, this is it. If the Minister is encouraging landlords to have nasty little six-month leases, which will then stagger on, under something that is little better than tacit relocation—or a sudden death version of tacit relocation, because the landlord can pull the plug at any given moment he will be creating a twilight tenancy that we want nothing to do with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall return to the general principle of assured tenancies when we discuss clause stand part, but the spirit of the amendment could ensure that future tenancies, or second instalment tenancies, would be for at least six months. Anything less than that would be downright intolerable. I am surprised that the Minister, or any other person claiming to represent people in Scotland, should talk such nonsense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The contributions from my honourable Friends have made it clear that the nature of short assured tenancies as such are opposed by Opposition Members. They are bad enough, but the operation of subsection (3) will be 100 times worse. I hope that the Minister will accept that. In fact, from his earlier remarks he seemed to indicate that he realises how much worse the operation of subsection (3) will make the position. The Minister seemed to be saying that with no notification to the tenant, under subsection (3) the landlord could allow the tenancy to continue as a short assured tenancy but with no security of tenure—certainly not six months, as is normal for short assured tenancies. Opposition Members have repeatedly said that such tenancies could be as short as one month, one week or one day, and then the tenant could be tossed out on his ear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At one point the Minister said that there was no need to notify the tenant of this change, because we are dealing with prolongation of the original lease and the tenant will already know what is implied. However, the tenant will not know, and will have no reason to know, that the nature of the continuing prolonged tenancy is different from the nature of the short assured tenancy. The Minister must accept that there is a pronounced difference between the short assured tenancy, of which the tenant is aware when he accepts it, and the changed nature of that tenancy under the operation of subsection (3). The Minister must make it clear that he accepts that there is a substantial difference between those two states of a tenancy as it moves from its ish at the end of the short assured tenancy into this new state of tenancy where a tenant can simply be turfed out with no notice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How does the Minister justify his earlier defence of tenants' rights by saying that landlords have an obligation to repair under schedule 10 of an earlier Act? How can an obligation to repair in any way be made effective if, as soon as the tenant complains about the need for the property to be repaired the landlord can throw him out under the terms of subsection (3)? The Minister must address himself to that problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tenants could find themselves in a terrible position if unscrupulous landlords were able to exploit tenants rights under subsection (3). Will the Minister accept our

argument that there will be no security of tenure as soon as the ish is passed? What does he intend to do about that if he accepts our arguments?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be helpful if I intervene again at this stage. My understanding is that under the clause, two-months' notice would have to be given for any conclusion of a tenancy. Therefore, if the second stage of the short assured tenancy were to be for a period of less than two months, is it the Minister's understanding that the landlord would be able to obtain possession of the property within the two months, or would that two-months' minimum notice still apply?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was trying to make a point on much the same basis. I was trying to put myself in the position of my previous incarnation when I was advising a landlord in a similar position. To make the matter to its ridiculous extreme, as the Bill is presently drafted it strikes me that short assured tenancy can be created and it would be in the option of the landlord thereafter to continue the tenancy, even on a daily basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My honourable Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) pointed out the terms of clause 30, which we have yet to come to. That clause gives the detail of how a landlord would recover possession. My honourable Friend is right to point out that two months' notice would be required. There is an inconsistency in the drafting of clauses 29 and 30. As clause 29 is drafted it is open for the period of the tenancy to be as short as possible. It is ludicrous to think in terms of a daily tenancy, but the potential is certainly there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, clause 30(l)(c) requires the landlord to give two months' notice. Clearly, the draftsman had intended that the second stage—the tenancy that continued either by notice or by tacit relocation—should last for six months. That is what we are arguing. Perhaps I am wrong, but I shall be delighted to hear what the Minister has to say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other defect that makes the measure so open to abuse by the landlord is simply that there is no provision in clause 30 to impose a limitation as to when the two months' notice should expire. There is a provision in the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984 that says that if a notice to terminate is not acted upon within a certain time limit it falls. The position here—I return to my extreme hypothesis that the daily tenancy continues—leaves me in no doubt that I could advise a landlord client to create a short assured tenancy and thereafter to continue it on a daily basis and at the same time to serve his two months' notice, which appears to have no time limit attaching to it. Therefore, the landlord will fulfil all the requirements of the Act and be immediately entitled to have the tenant out at any time. There are no restrictions on him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not a case in which the landlord can decide that he wants to have the tenant out and then serve his notice. As the Bill is drafted, he is required to give the tenant two months' notice. But why should he give the tenant two months' notice when the tenancy is continuing on a daily basis, unless, as I said, the draftsman's intention was to continue the tenancy on a six-monthly basis? If the landlord gives that notice at the same time that he extends the tenancy on a daily basis, and that notice does not
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>772</span>
expire, he can go to court at any time. He has satisifed all of the Bill's requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the sort of loophole that will be so attractive to every landlord—there are hundreds throughout the country—who looks for ways round the present Rent Acts. Those landlords who created licences rather than leases have been tested many times in the courts in Scotland. They are not unique; they are a regular occurrence. Those landlords seem to have a multiplicity of relatives who can live in accommodation and therefore acquire some benefit from the existing Rent Acts—the delivery of services, the rolls and milk deliveries. Any loophole that is available under the existing legislation, which is far tighter and far more protective to tenants, is abused at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are laying on a platter the opportunity for every landlord in Scotland who has a mind to do so to circumvent the law that is intended to give protection to tenants. The legislation is shot through with holes, and the Minister must address himself to the problems that we have raised. Those problems have not only occurred in my limited experience; they have been spotted by Shelter, which has enormous experience of those sorts of landlord, and it knows how this provision will be used.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It relation to security to tenure, a short assured tenancy does not provide the same security of tenure as does an assured tenancy. That is obvious, because the time limit will be much more restrictive in comparison. If a short assured tenancy is completed by contractual tenancy, the tenant and the landlord would have agreed its length, and the tenant would have had at least a minimum of six months for the first short assured tenancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) asked whether the renewal could be for a short period. The answer is yes, but the landlord must give the tenant two months' notice that he requires possession. Therefore, in practice two months will be the minimum. The honourable Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) asked whether a second stage was necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was grateful to my honourable Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) for pointing out the two months' notice requirement. I made the point earlier that there is no expiry period on that two months' notice. As I read the Bill, if two months' notice is given it is given, and it does not matter whether it is given in 1988, 1989 or 1990. It is given under the terms of the Bill and it does not expire. Has the Minister addressed himself to that problem? It appears that once given it is given, as long as it is within the period of the original short-term tenancy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have answered the honourable Gentleman. The first short assured tenancy must be for six months, then two months' notice has to given, as the honourable Gentleman said in relation to clause 30(1)(	<i>c</i>). The next period of the short assured tenancy could be much shorter. If the lease continues by tacit relocation the lease will still be at least six months each time, because they continue on the same basis. The honourable Member for Aberdeen, South shakes his head, but it most certainly will be, by tacit relocation, a repetition of six months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>773</span>
On the question of the short assured tenancy coming to its ish expiry date, if either the landlord or the tenant does nothing, or a new contractual tenancy is granted, there is no need to serve a notice on the tenant to the affect that the new tenancy is a short assured tenancy. I suggest that this is a matter of common sense, because there would be a prolongation of the original lease and the parties concerned would be well aware of the facts. To serve a notice upon them in those circumstances would be an unnecessary legalistic requirement, which would not add to their knowledge of the existing circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:: The Minister is right to say that I shook my head wrongly. He is correct to point out that if the lease continued on the basis of tacit relocation it would continue on the terms on which it had previously existed, if it was a six-month short assured tenancy. I accept that. Our point is that this is a loophole that will be grabbed eagerly by landlords wishing to put their tenants in the most invidious position that the law allows, which would be to terminate the tenancy and substitute by imposition, rather than by contract—which implies agreement—new terms and conditions that severely restrict the tenants' rights. The Minister did not address himself to that point. Simply to say that tacit relocation will continue the previous terms is not good enough, because landlords will not be content with that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister talked about common sense in applying the clause. Common sense seems sadly lacking. So far we have established that the maximum length of a short assured tenancy is six months, although I anticipate that it is likely that landlords will get into the habit of having a succession of six-monthly assured tenancies and we shall see large numbers of tenants in the private sector in Scotland involved in six-monthly renewals. As my honourable Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South said, there is no need to go to that trouble. It will be possible either to let matters stagger on on the basis of a short assured tenancy or to renew on a shorter basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have established that the minimum notice that can be given to someone who is on a short assured tenency, whether before or after its ish, or whether it is into the next stage of the short assured tenancy, will be two months. We wonder what common sense there can be in a second-stage short assured tenancy being established by a landlord in terms of notice of less than two months given under the clause. It must be possible under the statute for the landlord to give notice that he is prepared to renew for one month or six weeks, but in practical legislative terms we have established that the tenancy cannot be concluded and the tenant evicted until two months are up. What is logical there, and where is the common sense?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we want to bring back into use a large proportion of the empty houses in Scotland and the people who own them have left for a short period, say, six months, the time involved may be very short. If a landlord gives two months' notice and does not take steps to repossess, and years later tries to rely upon one of the grounds for repossession, I give an off-the-cuff legal opinion that the court would be unlikely to accept that as convincing evidence if it had not been followed up earlier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This aspect of the provision for short tenancies is alarming. There should surely be provision to ensure the reasonable length of second-phase tenancies. Under clause 30, there is two months, the minimum notice that can be given of the end of such a lease. Six months is short enough; the time should not be made shorter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 213, in page 17, line 25, leave out "notice in writig" and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"written notice in such form as may be prescribed".</p></blockquote>
This is a minor amendment to require the notice given under clause 29(4) to be prescribed by regulations, like other notices under part II of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 214, in page 17, line 26, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(5) Section 25 shall apply in relation to a short assured tenancy as if in subsection (1) of that section the reference to an assured tenancy were a reference to a short assured tenancy.".</p></blockquote>
The amendment seeks to ensure that when a rent assessment committee is determinig the appropriate rent for a short assured tenancy when the landlord has proposed an increase under clause 24, its guidelines should be rents for short assured tenancies, not for ordinary assured tenancies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debates on clause 24 proceeded on the basis that the tenants who were to be provided with short assured tenancies had very little in the way of rights, apart from those specified in the clause. I am sure that the record of the debates will show that Opposition Members have said several times, and were not contradicted by Conservative Members, that tenants had no right to apply to the rent assessment committee. Does clause 29 give that right to tenants on a short assured tenancy? If it does, it is a significant advance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If there is a dispute over a short assured tenancy, the tenants can apply to the rent assessment committee to have the dispute determined. The amendment is straightforward and the honourable Member should be quite happy with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not unhappy with the amendment, but I am worried about it standing in isolation. I have only just spotted it, so I am in some difficulty, but if the Minister is confirming that any tenant who has a short assured tenancy is entitled to apply to the rent officer to have the rent reviewed, of course I am perfectly happy with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The position under the amendment would be that when the tenancy in respect of which the rent increase has been applied for is a short assured tenancy, the rent which the committee determines
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>776</span>
is that appropriate to a short assured tenancy, and it will normally be lower than for an ordinary assured tenancy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Where does it say in the Bill that the rent must be referred to the rent assessment committee? Where does the tenant obtain the power to refer to that committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that it is somewhere in clause 31, which is headed:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Reference of excessive rents to rent assessment committee."</p></blockquote>
It would help the Committee to make progress if the honourable Gentleman would agree to discuss the matter more fully on clause 31.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am certainly against the proposals that the clause should stand part of the Bill. The clause is at the heart of the Bill in many respects, and in my view, it is one of the most pernicious clauses in any housing Bill that has recently come before the House. My colleagues have amply demonstrated that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is even a confusion of terms in clause 29. It is clear from the debate and the brief that we have heard that the short assured tenancy is a misnomer, because it may last for years. A tenant can be in a property for up to 10 years, maintaining it as all tenants do, looking after the garden, carrying out minor repairs and settling down in it, only to be put out on the street after all those years. That is at the heart of our objection to the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are some major contradictions in other parts of the clause, in relation to the extension of tenants' rights at the end of the short assured tenancy and what happens after the six months' period has expired. The Minister has just said that only if the lease is extended by tacit relocation will it be extended for another definite period of six months. However, a landlord can use many ways to persuade a tenant to accept a contractual tenancy which may be of two months' duration and renewable month by month thereafter. That could be a major erosion of tenants' rights, not only after the first six months, but particularly if the assured tenancy has continued for two or three successive periods of six months, so that the tenancy is taken into a second year, or even a third or fourth year, and the tenant finds himself deprived of fundamental rights that he now has.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that clause 29 be struck from the Bill. It will not extend tenants' rights and it will pave the way for landlords, particularly unscrupulous landlords, to exploit tenants who are in a much weaker position and deprive them of basic rights that they now have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my honourable Friend for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths) said, clause 29 is at the heart of the Bill and covers one of the fundamental aspects of part II. After our earlier debates on the assured tenancy system—we have demonstrated that the tenancies will be far from assured and, indeed, that they will be signally insecure—here we have the second fiddle, the new system of housing tenure in Scotland which the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0505">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>777</span>
Government chooses to describe as the short assured tenancy. As my honourable Friend said, in many cases those tenancies may turn out to be considerably longer than the other tenancies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that the short assured tenancy will be the most commonly used mechanism under this legislation—if it ever reaches the statute book, as I fear it will. The assured tenancy affords some security, but precious little rent control. The short assured tenancy affords some rent control—which will be discussed later—but little security. It gives security for six months only and in two-monthly instalments from then onwards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister constantly tells us that the Bill will establish a wonderful principle and speaks of a brave new future in which many thousands of vacant properties will suddenly be available to let. Apparently, it is to be the great panacea of Scotland's housing problems—blocks of properties in city centres, farm cottages and other properties in market towns and villages, which have hitherto have been boarded up and have stood empty, will suddenly be made available for tenants. That is a wonderful suggestion, but I wonder whether such a tenure will be any great advantage to those tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Presumably the Government gave some thought to their proposals. Will the Minister therefore give us an estimate of how many properties, and what type, are likely to come newly into or back into circulation as a result of the Bill? We have our doubts. The private sector has been given incentives in the past to improve and let houses, but the response has not been especially impressive. The Government evidently think that something dramatic will happen as a consequence of their proposals, but frankly I doubt it. If it does happen, I am not sure whether it will be good news for those who have such tenancies. In the short term, the legislation might get some desperate people off the housing waiting lists and rescue them from the prospect of homelessness, but I wonder how many will find that they have gone from the frying pan into the fire. When they stay with their own families, neighbours, friends or whoever, and are on the local authority housing waiting list, there is at least some prospect of obtaining a secure tenancy of a house which they would call their own and in which their families could live throughout their lives. However, as soon as they move into the insecure, short assured tenancy system, they will live from hand to mouth for goodness knows how long. Who knows how soon they might find themselves homeless and in all manner of trouble.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What category of prospective tenants do the Government expect to take advantage of the legislation? Advantage is probably the wrong word because the legislation does not offer many advantages. I realise that thousands of desperate people would give a great deal to have a roof over their heads and a home to call their own. No doubt some will be sufficiently desperate to sign themselves into the predicament which the Government have set up for them under the Bill. But whom do the Government have in mind? About 200,000 people in Scotland are currently stuck on local authority housing waiting lists, including many who want transfers. It does not matter whether they want transfers or their first home—they still require new accommodation and perhaps to transfer to another area for family or
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>778</span>
employment reasons or any number of other important circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister expect young families to move into accommodation under such a tenure? Would he advise a young family to move into a house with security for only six months and perhaps two months at a time after that? What kind of future is that for Scottish families? Does the Minister seriously suggest that his or my constituents should enter into that kind of trap, with the attendant uncertainty for those households, their children and the families of those involved? Does the Minister think that people who are on the local authority transfer lists because they live in overcrowded accommodation should avail themselves of the provision? Who does he think he is kidding? Does he suggest that a family currently living in a grossly overcrowded local authority house and wanting to move to a bigger house would be crazy enough to move into a property which will provide security for only six months? The Minister cannot insult the intelligence of the Committee or the people of Scotland to that extent. Does the Minister suggest that pensioners living in houses that are too big for them and wanting to move to smaller houses and other elderly people in his constituency or mine should move into cottages in the private rented sector under the legislation when they will be secure for only six months?
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
What kind of tenure do the Government think they are creating? Who do they think they are fooling when they suggest that short-term, stop-gap, cosmetic legislation will solve any of the problems of Scotland's housing crisis? Will the Minister say, first, how many properties he expects will come into circulation as a result of the legislation? Secondly, what part of the housing market does he expect to be met by this aspect of the legislation? It is a pretty unattractive aspect and I do not imagine that anyone in his right mind would want to move his family or household into that kind as short-term trap.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

He has been blessed and had the good fortune all of his life to enjoy the privileges which he seeks to deny others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the honourable Gentleman that some conservative Members have been in circumstances where one welcomed the chance to have a property to call one's own—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For six months?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, for six months. The honourable Gentleman has not lived a real life, so he does not understand. He has not had to move around to create a progressive career or to try to find—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] The honourable Gentleman laughs, but that is what made Scotland great. The Scots moved to create opportunities to make life better for their families. When I was young and first married, I was in the Royal Air Force. I was delighted to be given the opportunity to have a cottage in Lincolnshire so that I could be with my wife until we could

get more permanent accommodation. We lived in that cottage for six months, with monthly extensions. That may seem surprising, but many people were in similar circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for East Lothian does not seem to realise what the real world is about. In his attempts to make everything the same—to produce a sameness which some call equal opportunity—the honourable Gentleman denies opportunities to those in need. There is no question whatever that a substantial number of people will take advantage of the opportunity provided by the legislation. It matters not whether it is 200, 2,000 or 200,000—it will be an improvement. It is nonsense for properties to stand empty when people want accommodation for short periods because that will suit them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps we should remember the problems that arose when the oilfields were first developed. People were desperate to have properties for short periods because often they did not know how long they would be in one place. I use that recent example, but there will be many others because people who move with their work often want short-term tenancies so that they can make more long-term arrangements in the locality of their new jobs. That is one reason why young people will take the opportunity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A problem in Scotland is lack of mobility of labour and lack of opportunity to move. Many people are tied to the most tied houses of all—council houses. Nothing ties an individual more than a council house. The honourable Member for East Lothian shakes his head because he does not know what it is like to live in council housing. He has no experience of it. The sheltered and privileged existence which he has enjoyed comes through clearly.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman finds what I say amusing, but the most heartbreaking thing that can happen to anyone, especially someone who has been made redundant and who is keen to work, is to look for a job, find one and then he unable to accept it because the man cannot get accommodation for himself and his family. Of course the provision will be beneficial.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) referred to the contribution of my honourable Friend, the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) as appalling. However, I noticed that whereas the speech of the honourable Member for Tayside, North was met by laughter from the Opposition Benches, when my honourable Friend made his moving statement the Secretary of State had his face buried in his handkerchief, so touched was he with my honourable Friend's argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was blowing my nose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like my honourable Friend, I contend that the clause should not stand part of the Bill. It is an appalling provision, which no conscientious member of the Committee should support. It decisively alters the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>780</span>
balance of rights in favour of the landlord and away from the tenant. The important point is not that the clause alters the balance in favour of the landlord but that it does so away from the tenant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The balance was previously held by the Minister to be worth waiting for and even staying up all night for, as he says that he did in 1980 when he argued in support of the Tenants' Rights Etc. (Scotland) Act 1980. That Act included the existing balance between landlord and tenant which the Minister now contemptuously dismisses and says is not worth the paper on which it is written, although he defended it not so long ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Landlords will be able to reign supreme. Security of tenure, instead of being limited to a year, will be limited to only six months and, as we saw from the debate on subsection (3), to much less than six months. There will be no maximum limit such as the present five-year limit, and the period may be as long as 10 years. As my honourable Friend says, unsecured tenancies will become the norm. The Minister may be naive but commercial landlords are not, and they will pursue their own self-interest and seek to maximise their advantage under the legislation. They will not depend on assured tenancies, which the Minister sees as the flagship of his policy for the private rented sector. Landlords will rely heavily and almost predominantly on short assured tenancies through which they can maximise their advantages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No doubt on later clauses the Minister will wax lyrical about how he will introduce extra protection against harassment and illegal eviction, but his words will have a hollow ring. Why should landlords bother harassing their tenants or illegally evicting them when it will be so easy to evict them legally under clause 29?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will have to confront the issue because the characteristics of Scotland's housing needs are well known to us all. Tens of thousands of families are homeless and 1.25 million Scots live in overcrowded conditions. Hundreds of thousands of Scots live in damp, condensation-affected houses. My honourable Friend the Member for East Lothian said that there were more than 200,000 people on council house waiting lists in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's housing policy should be designed to tackle the housing needs of people in Scotland, yet in view of the Government's policy on the private rented sector those families and their desprate needs may as well not exist. Short assured tenancies will do nothing for families with such housing needs. People who are homeless need access to decent housing at prices that they can afford, but they will not get it under short assured tenancies. People who live in overcrowded conditions need access to larger accommodation at prices that they can afford, but they will not get it under short assured tenancies and those who live in damp houses will not get properly maintained homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For whom are short assured tenancies designed? The White Paper says that the Government's policy on the matter is to be determined by what it calls "marked demand" and states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"there is an important potential market for people who do need mobility or whose circumstances are such that they do not wish to be tied by the ownership of their home."</p></blockquote>
Those, we are told, are the people for whom short assured

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>781</span>
tenancies are inteded. The description reminds me of a euphemism for the unemployed. Someone who has been out of work for one, two or three years may think that he needs mobility if he is ever to find a job. Because he has been unemployed for so long, his circumstances may be such that he does not want to be tied by owner occupation and a mortgage round his neck.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's policies are badly directed to helping people who are out of work. The White Paper says that the private sector will respond with greater flexibility to the demand created by those seeking work across Britain and that it will provide housing in ways which will encourage labour mobility and which will help progress
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>782</span>
towards a better match between supply and demand for labour. That is poppycock, as the Minister should know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Dundee, East I was visited by a man who had been out of work for two or three years. He had had periodic jobs with the council when he was taken on for snow clearance in the winter or for holiday relief, but he always went back on the dole. He had been seeking work across Britain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
