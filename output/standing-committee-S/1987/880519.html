APPOINTMENTS</div> <!-- title -->
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cumbernauld and Kilsyth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 192, in page 7, line 31, leave out "and assistant.".<br><br>
Our purpose is to ascertain why assistant head teachers have been selected by the Government for special mention in the Bill as persons whose appointment will come under the influence of school boards. Initially, the Minister proposed to have ceiling powers which would have given the school boards far-reaching authority over the appointment of head teachers and all school staff. Subsequently, that was changed, but the Opposition have been greatly exercised by the way in which the Minister has succeeded in slipping in by the back door a proposal that boards will be able to add or delete names from the short leet.<br><br>
We shall come shortly to consider schedule 2, which will permit us to pursue the matter in greater depth, but I do not believe that it is appropriate for the influence of school boards over appointments to extend to assistant head teachers. My understanding of the present management structure is that the head teacher is the principal official in a school, and that he or she has a depute who can act for the head teacher in his or her absence and who can—[<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I appreciate that hon. Members may wish to talk, but they should do so more quietly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The head teacher has a depute who can act in his or her absence. That is a perfectly usual arrangement and is consistent with management arrangements in education, industry and elsewhere, but to extend the influence of boards on the short list of assistant head teachers is not a good idea. It appears that a number of posts would come under that heading, and it adds up to too many. The Minister's intention would be achieved if the clause and schedule applied only to head teachers and depute head teachers, and it is unnecessary to extend the influence of the boards.<br><br>
I am reluctant to subscribe to the conspiracy theory of Forsythian politics, but I have a nasty feeling that we are going back to the famous ceiling powers under which the Minister wanted everyone to be appointed
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 446</span>
by the board, from the head teacher down to the assistant janitor and even the cleaner. We have come a long way since then, but it would be better from a management point of view if the breakpoint came at depute, not assistant head teacher, and I am sure that that when the Minister thinks about it, he will come to the same conclusion and readily accept amendment No. 162.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope to persuade the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg) so that when he thinks about it, he will wish that he had not moved the amendment.<br><br>
There should be a proper appointments procedure for senior staff in a school, and that procedure should involve the local authority. Perhaps I misheard the hon. Gentleman, but he spoke of removing names from short leets. That applies only to the appointment of head teachers, not to other senior appointments, where the procedure is different. Only with a head teacher's appointment can the appointment panel add or remove names.<br><br>
Throughout our discussions the hon. Gentleman has been concerned about the position of the education authority, and I understand his concern. I would have thought that he would welcome .he feet that we have defined the senior managers of a school rather broadly to include assistant and deputy heads.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman mentioned ceiling powers. I no longer use that expression, in deference to the climb down from the ceiling, which the hon. Gentleman hailed as a great victory on his part. We shall discuss later the powers that the Bill gives to boards over the appointment of non-senior staff, if there is such a term. It is like "un-wisdom". That would not involve an automatic right of participation by the local authority. Even if a school board took those powers to appoint junior members of staff, it would not be able to take powers to appoint senior members of staff other than on the basis set out in schedule 2, which gives the local authority a guaranteed role.<br><br>
On the basis of his own arguments, perhaps the hon. Gentleman will feel inclined to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of the Minister's remarks, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are worried about the school board having any influence on the appointment of staff. That power should rest firmly with the education authority. It would be appropriate for parents, through the agency of the school board, to have a direct influence on appointment committees, but the way in which the proposal is structured does not lend itself readily to that. The proposal goes too far and, as far as I know, has not been requested by any significant body of education opinion. I am not aware of parents having made such
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0998">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 447</span>
a demand through any of their organisations, nor of teachers' organisations having sought the provision. I am not aware that any of the education authorities thought that the additional power would add to the quality of education, which is what all education Bills should be about.<br><br>
I am at a loss to understand the purpose of clause 11 and schedule 2, but when we discuss schedule 2 we shall be able to explore the proposal in detail. I am far from happy to permit this enabling proposal. I shall ask my hon. Friends to vote against clause 11, to register our disapproval of the proposal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised to hear what the hon. Gentleman says. All I can say is that he cannot have talked to many headmasters recently. If he had done so he would know that head teachers would welcome the opportunity for the conference of the Head Teachers Association of Scotland to have a right to be involved in the appointments of senior staff for the first time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has misunderstood me, and perhaps that is my fault. We are not against parents having an influence in appointments, but we do not agree with the method that is proposed. The decision must lie wholly with the authority. There could be parental input through the appointments committee, but the provision that is before us is not the way to proceed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to have the hon. Gentleman's acknowledgement that he supports the principle of involving parents in appointments and of giving head teachers a right to be involved in appointments. Some local authorities have been more progressive than others—for example, Lothian. Central region, which I believe is known as the Albania of education authorities, is somewhat less progressive, and I have not had the opportunity of benefitting from anything other than the Albanian experience.<br><br>
Appointments are made by the education authority. The selection procedure gives due regard to the roles of the authority and of the school boards, and it provides for the director of education to give advice. The procedure may not go the whole hog and limit power to education authorities as opposed to parents as the hon. Gentleman would perhaps prefer, but it probably strikes the right balance and I think that the Committee should support the clause.</span></p>

APPOINTMENT OF HEADTEACHERS, DEPUTIES AND<br><br> ASSISTANTS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John McFall <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 161 in page 16, line 19, leave out from second "and" to end of line 20 and insert
<br><blockquote><p>"one of the nominees of the education authority shall act as the Chairman of the Committee and one other shall be the headteacher".</p></blockquote>
The amendment relates to the appointments committee, about which we have a number of reservations, not least the fact that paragraph 2 gives rise to concern on an issue of major principle.<br><br>
Paragraph 2(a) deals with the appointment of a head teacher where the elected member is appointed as chairman. This procedure is perfectly proper as it rests on the basic proposition that ultimate accountability to the public rests with the elected member. However, subparagraph (b) departs from the principle of accountability where in the appointments of deputy or assistant heads the head teacher acts as chairman of the appointments committee.<br><br>
We contend that that arrangement is entirely inappropriate for the reason that we agree with subparagraph (a)—namely, that ultimate accountability rests with the elected member. The head teacher would be placed in an invidious position if he had authority over those to whom he was accountable—the elected member—and those to whom he was an adviser—the school board. Few head teachers would want to be put in that position.<br><br>
The Minister mentioned a number of authorities with different schemes in operation. In Strathclyde the head teacher is not on the appointments committee, although I would welcome the head teacher serving on such a committee.<br><br>
Nevertheless, in Strathclyde great recognition is given to the weight of the head teacher's opinions and the opportunities that are given to him or her to express views and to be involved in decisions to appoint. That is perfectly proper. Being a member of the board but not being the chairman, the head teacher can adequately carry out this function. A member should be chairman of the appointments committee because at the end of the day the head teacher is answerable to the education authority. For that reason we are tabling amendment No. 161.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is interesting to see the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) standing on his head. Only a few moments ago he was telling us how improper it would be to have amateurs and parents involved in professional matters. The hon. Gentleman is now arguing that it would be inappropriate for the head teacher to perform the role that we are discussing and appropriate for an elected member to perform it because he will be more accountable. That is a perfectly respectable argument, but the hon. Gentleman must recognise that it runs contrary to what he has been spoon feeding the Commitee about—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has it wrong. I am proposing that the head teacher should be on the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0999">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 449</span>
board and a voting member but not in a position of authority over an elected member. However, the role and authority of the head teacher will remain, and that is the thrust of our proposition.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But we are talking about an appointments committee where senior staff are being appointed to the school, not about the board. The nature and quality of the staff is surely more a professional than a political matter.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dumbarton has been busily telling the Committee how inappropriate it is to have parents dabbling in curriculum matters, for example, because these are best left to the professionals. However, the hon. Gentleman is now telling us that it will be far better to have an elected councillor deciding, perhaps on a casting vote because that is what the chairman has, what is appropriate in terms of senior staffing. No doubt the hon. Gentleman will be able to square the circle, but I think that he is standing on his head.<br><br>
I am sure that if the matter is pressed to a vote, the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) will enthusiastically support the Government. That is because we want the head teacher, in line with what the hon. Gentleman has said, to have real authority in his school and a real degree of independent influence over the choice of staff in the school.<br><br>
The authority has half the membership of the appointments committee and the director of education, the authority's chief education officer, has a right to advise that committee. It is true that the head teacher is in a position where he can use a casting vote against his employer, and I see nothing wrong in that. Indeed, that is part of the independence and strengthening of the authority of the head teacher, which I understood from Opposition Members should be provided.<br><br>
The Bill has been attacked by Opposition Members on the basis that it undermines the authority of the head teacher, but here we have an amendment which is geared to achieve precisely that purpose. I see no conflict in the head teacher as a professional having authority with respect to his employers and elected members. Indeed, I have come across this from time to time, as the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy (Dr. Moonie) will no doubt confirm, in health boards where it is not unusual for senior professionals to have a degree of independence from their employers in professional matters—for example, consultant medical staff who are employed by health boards.<br><br>
I ask the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) to withdraw his amendment. If he does press it to a vote, I hope that the hon. Member for Gordon will join us in rejecting it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John McAllion <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am perplexed by the Minister's arguments. He seems to be saying that the suggestion that elected members should have a vital say in the appointment of senior staff to schools is unsual. In fact, that happens now. All appointments to schools are made by appointment committees, and complete professional guidance is given to those committees because the head teacher is usually present, as are education officials. They
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 450</span>
cheerfully advise elected members who make the decisions. They do so for the good reason that they are accountable to their electorates for such decisions.<br><br>
The Minister says that he wants to give power back to the people, to the consumers, to ensure that they have some control over those who make vital decisions. But, in this instance, they will have no control because the head teacher will make the decision. If there is an equal number of school board members and education authority appointees, and if there is a tied vote—that is a split between the school board and the education authority—the head teacher will decide who becomes an employee of the education authority. Clause 15(2) states that the education autority will not be allowed to delegate to school boards
<br><blockquote><p>"the function of giving employment".</p></blockquote>
In reality, however, that power will be delegated to the head teacher, who will have the decisive casting vote. An eduction authority will therefore be asked to employ someone when it has had no control over the choice of the appointment. The education authorities will be the employer but it will be unable to say who should have the job. That power will be taken from it and given to a combination of the head teacher and the school board.<br><br>
If education authorities are to be the employers they should be able to select their employees, but the Minister's proposals will prevent them from so doing. Therefore, the real employers—those who decide whom is appointed—will be the school board and the head teacher, not the education authority. In some circumstances a candidate might be imposed on an authority. It will have to employ him but it will have had no influence in choosing him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) seems to be confused. He appears to argue that the elected members carry the can, are accountable to their electors and that they should take the decision. However, I could argue that elected members of school boards are accountable to their electorates and that it would therefore be appropriate for them to be the only people involved in appointments. But such an argument would be nonsense because, as the hon. Gentleman said, the education authority has an interest. That is why we balanced the appointments committee with equal numbers from the school board and the education authority.<br><br>
The head teacher is responsible for the management and running of a school and senior staff are part of his management team. It is only right and proper that he should have a major say in such appointments. The hon. Gentleman might argue that councillors work in that way currently and that the system works well. In Albania—in Central region—head teachers are appointed on the basis of meetings of councillors who interview candidates for 15 minutes each and then vote on who should be appointed. If the hon. Gentleman wants to defend such a practice, that is up to him. But the Bill provides a statutory appointments procedure which for the first time, will take account of all interests and try to provide a balance. I am sorry that the hon.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I1000">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 451</span>
Gentleman hankers after the type of thinking that is characterised—I admit that it is the worst case—by education authorities such as Central region.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Lewis Moonie <span class='memberconstituency'>(Kirkcaldy)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the Minister betrays his sad ignornce of the procedures of appointing staff in an authority such as Fife. I note that the Minister shakes his head, bu I do not think that he has ever sat on an education or an appointments committee, as some of us have done. Indeed, some of us have faced them. I sat on one for four years, appointing more than 100 senior educaion staff, and I know the procedures.<br><br>
Staff for such posts are not selected on the basis of the short leet interview alone. The main part of the interview—rightly so—is the long leet, which is conducted by the professional staff of the education authority. It involves an in-depth interview that continues for much longer than 15 minutes. It may be well over one or even two hours of in-depth work with the member of staff involved to ascertain whether the candidate is competent to do the job for which he has applied.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was talking specifically about Central region. I acknowledge that some education authorities have highly developed and good appointments systems. Unfortunately the best are not followed by all authorities. The proposal seeks to establish a statutory basis which is reasonable for all concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Moonie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If only the guiding light that Fife shows in education were generalised in Scotland.<br><br>
I am putting forward what I consider to be the best way of appointing staff. The other issue which the Minister has not apparently recognised is that it is right that the head teacher has a say in who is appointed to the staff of his school. That is his right under the present system, and his advice is listened to carefully before a decision is reached. By and large, his advice is adhered to. In about 80 per cent. to 85 per cent. of the decisions of the appointments board of which I was a member, the head teacher's views prevailed and their choice of members of staff were appointed. This did not always happen of course. Head teachers are not onmipotent, they have their specialty and specialist interests. <i>[Interruption.]</i> There is an unseemly levity in Committee this afternoon; it must be because it is Thursday.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are many ways of appointing people. Only today, a pack of cards was used to make an appointment in Stirling. I am pleased to say that once again the Labour party won.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Moonie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to hear it, and I am sure that the Minister is delighted that justice has again been done.<br><br>
On the knotty problem of appointing senior staff to schools, the head teacher is not an expert in every avenue of education. He has his own specialty and this is recognised by the fact that the main professional advice given to the Committee before it
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 452</span>
decides comes from the curriculum adviser and the member of the directorate responsible for that area of education. There is a good reason for this. Theirs is the overview of education and their view should prevail so that the most suitable appointment is made. I agree that councillors are as likely as parents or others to make bad appointments. I am amazed at some of the choices that they make, especially in Central region. However, I accept the democratic will; these people have to live with their conscience and their choice because that is democracy.<br><br>
The procedure will always be inverted. It is arrived at by ensuring that through the long leet only those who come forward to a short leet interview are those whom the education authority and the head teacher are willing to have on their staff. Making the head teacher chairman of the appointments committee rather than an adviser to it, or even a member of it, is putting him in an invidious position with regard to employers and the professional staff who are superiors and advisers. I should be grateful if the Minister would recognise his opposition to the proposal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister must think of the position in which he would place head teachers if the proposed system were set up. Head teachers are like anyone else. They are pursuing a career structure and becoming a head teacher is not the end of their career, as witness my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall). Head teachers often look to joining the directorate and advancing through the promotion structure in regional councils. The Minister is placing heads in the indvidious position of having to use their casting vote against their employers, and many heads might think twice about falling foul of their employer. The extent to which the head's vote would be entirely independent has to be considered carefully, because if he is anxious to ingratiate himself and to move ahead and be selected as assistant director or deputy director of education, he may think twice about going against the education authority's nominees on the committee. I do not know what happens inside Central region but I am sure that the Minister does. I know that Tayside regions operates precisely the same type of system of long leet and short leet as that which applies in Fife, so applicants for the senior posts in schools are sifted carefully by people who know what they are doing. When councillors ultimately make the decision, they often do so on the advice of school officials and head teachers, and that decision is usually not opposed by the elected members.<br><br>

The Minister is entering uncharted waters. In my view, he is putting head teachers in an unfortunate position by making them choose a person who may be opposed by the parent members of the school board or by the employer—the eduction authority. The Minister should think again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am appalled by that remark. If the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) is suggesting that head teachers as professionals should be looking over their shoulders

at what will advance their career prospects within the education authority, as opposed to choosing the candidate who will make the best contribution to theri schools, he paints a sinister picture of what happens in education authorities. It makes the case for a statutory system of appointmetns more strongly and more eloquently than I can.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister must know from his experience in this place that hon. Members spend most of their time looking over their shoulders wondering how to achieve preferment and not cross their superiors—in this case, the Whips Office.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span> <i>rose</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way to the hon. member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg) so that he may give us the benefit of his experience in the Opposition Whips Office.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a way to obtain preferment which has nothing to do with the Whips. That is to make sure that most of one's rivals lose their seats at the general election.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman took the words out of my mouth. One could debate—it would not be in order on this occasion—the extent to which politicians are professionals, but I expect head teachers to behave as professionals, and part of being a professional is to make the right judgments, to behave with integrity and not to have an eye on one's future. The hon. Gentleman paints a very depressing picture of local government, and it underscores the importance of returning power to the local level and away from the unseemly scene that he paints. That may be characteristic of Tayside, and perhaps Central region, but I am sure that there are enclaves in education authorities where such things no longer happen.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister is not implying that I was a professional before June 1987 but have become something entirely different which he cannot now describe.<br><br>
The amendment, which is—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 161.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Knox. I attended the Select Committee on Defence all afternoon, listening to the Secretary fo State for Defence whom we allowed to leave early to canvas in Scotland. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gordon)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 66, in page 17, line 14, leave out from "Board" to end of line 16.<br><br>
This amendment balances the previous amendment. As the Minister rightly suggested, had that amendment been pushed to a vote I should have
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 454</span>
been inclined to vote against it, but the provision in the schedule which says that staff members of the board should effectively be excluded from contributing to the appointment of a head teacher is tilting the balance the other way.<br><br>
I understand the reasoning behind the provision. The obvious point for the Minister to make is that the staff members of the committee will have to serve under the head teacher who is appointed. That is true, of course, but it is equally true that they are on the board because they have a professional knowledge of the school and have the teachers' interests at heart. Their judgment of the qualities required of a head teacher should be taken into account.<br><br>
Many of us question whether this is the right approach, but given that parents have a majority there is no way that the teachers can deermine the head teacher's selection. However, they may make contributions that are influential and in most cases, I contend, helpful.<br><br>
The second line of defence applies with all teaching departments—namely, that no one comes forward as a short leet applicant for a head teacher's post who has not been approved through a long leet process by the lcoal authority. It is unnecessary to suggest that staff members should not be allowed to contribute to the discussion. Whoever is put forward is, by definition, a candidate considered suitable for a head teaching post.<br><br>
Parents have a majority on the board and the amendments seeks to ensure that staff members have an input equal to their proportion on the board, which many of us consider to be inadequate in any case. The amendment is simply an attempt to ensure that school boards operate as a genuine partnership.<br><br>
I suspect that when the Bill comes into effect many parents who, unlike the Committee, have not read the Bill will express surprise at this provision. Many staff members will express resentment because the provision will underline the fact that they are darned lucky to be on the board and that they are second-class members, excluded from participation in all its activities.<br><br>
The Minister must make up his mind. He has insisted on having a parental majority and on downgrading the proportion of staff representatives on the board. Now he insists that staff members cannot participate in some aspects of the board's activities. The Minister is going too far if, having tilted the balance as he has, he does not make the staff on the board full, equal, participative members, comparable with any other members of the board. That objective is the basic purpose of the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, but I shall have to ask the Committee to reject the amendment. It is most unfortunate. If the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) had been here when we debated amendment No. 190 I would have been prepared to advise the Committee to consider it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was only 10 seconds late.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. Unfortunately, I cannot help the hon. Gentleman on his amendment but if you
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I1002">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 455</span>
will allow me to do so, Mr. Knox, perhaps I can help him with his suggestion on handbooks. It is an excellent idea and perhaps we could consider it for guidance to authorities, if not for legislation.<br><br>
I am puzzled by the amendment. Surely the hon. Gentleman sees the sense of excluding a member of the school staff from participating in the appointment of his or her boss.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Factory workers should appoint their bosses too.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was thinking on my feet and pondering the way in which we elect leaders of political parties in this place.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman must surely see the sense in the principle that is well established in the education service. The amendment would mean that when the short leet was considered all kinds of personal and career information on candidates would be made available. It would be grossly unfair to burden a junior colleague with such facts. It would also be unfair to the successful candidate for head teacher if one of his staff had had access to her personal record.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister is worried about members of staff having access to a candidate's records, why is he not concerned about parents of children at the school having access to the same records?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Because the head teacher will be the boss of the people concerned, and will not have the same relationship with other members of the board, to whom he will be required to give advice and support. The relationship is completely different, and the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) should be able to see that.<br><br>
I expected the hon. Member for Gordon to say that other employees of the education authority may serve on the school board by virtue of being parents, not teachers. There may even be a case for excluding them from participating in appointments procedures, but that is not a matter with which we need burden the Bill. It is a matter that can be dealt with in the form of guidance, which we shall issue, on a board's conduct of its business, in advising it on the circumstances in which we think it will be reasonable for a board member to withdraw from the proceedings of the board.<br><br>
It is wrong to talk about second-class members. Members will represent different interests with different functions and it is appropriate for them to be involved with different board activities in different ways.<br><br>
I hope that on reflection the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister, especially for advancing arguments that I had not put. I know, however, that the Minister was anxious only to ensure that his brief was fully discharged.<br><br>
The Minister has replied in the vein that I had anticipated. I immediately understood the purpose
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 456</span>
behind the schedule but, in practical circumstances—especially if there is a good working relationship with the board—I am confident that parent board members are likely to consult teacher members, who are off the board in any event. In a sense, it is almost worse that they may get the information second-hand and unofficially rather than be entrusted with it in an official capacity.<br><br>
The Minister's approach imbues a degree of hierarchy that goes beyond what we need to tolerate. I take the view that professionals judge professionals by their professionalism, and head teachers are appointed on the basis of their record. Therefore, it is not a disadvantage for other teachers to know the record of relevant applicants. Indeed, it is an advantage for them to know of it. For example—I say this in a slight manner of levity—I have heard it said that when people have been on appointing committees and employees over whom the person has been appointed complain that they are not sure whether they are happy with the appointment, the standard response is, "You should have seen the others". Perhaps that is a lighthearted response, but board members are either board members or they are not, and I stand by my argument.<br><br>
Given that the Minister is anxious to change the circumstances and blow a little fresh air into the system, he should be slightly less resistant. I have gained a little from the Minister's argument although I am not sure that I agree with it. We could treat the staff members of the board, who have been sufficiently downgraded in any event, as full and equal members, and I am sorry that we are not going to. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 171, in page 17, line 22, leave out paragraph 11 and insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"11. After considering the short leet, the Board may make such comments to the appointment committee as it thinks fit; the appointment committee shall consider the leet and any comment made by the Board and make their recommendation under paragraph 16 below".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 172, in page 17, line 23, leave out "and deletions from".<br><br>
No. 163, in page 17, line 27, leave out "2" and insert "3".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 171 follows from the consultation paper and the power of veto which the Minister drew back on. We think, however, that paragraph 11, as drafted, is defective, which is why we have tabled the amendment. There is a simplicity about the amendment that gives it more effectiveness, bearing in mind that paragraph 11 effectively gives the board the power of veto.<br><br>
Let us consider the position that has existed since 1974. The Minister mentioned the situation in the Central region and elsewhere where there is a preponderance of elected members, and I endorse the appointments procedure that has been introduced since 1974 in areas such as Lothian, where there has been a judicious balance. That has been welcomed.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I1003">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 457</span>
Unfortunately, the position before 1974 was not one with which we could be proud. The trend of procedures since 1974, however, has been towards a professionally created short leet with the final choice of the successful candidate being made by a balance of elected and professional groups. We would like to maintain that. The proposals clearly invite canvassing—nay, nepotism—and for that reason we want the amendment to be considered from a professional viewpoint.</span></p>
<p>5.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not understand where the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) gets the idea of nepotism.<br><br>
The amendment would remove the ability of the board to adjust the short leet for head teachers. Amendment No. 172 would reduce the board's power by permitting it only to add names to the leet, and amendment No. 171 would permit the board only to comment. The amendments are unacceptable because they remove a vital opportunity for the board to make judgments about the suitability of candidates and to adjust the short leet accordingly.<br><br>
The Bill specifies the procedures in the context of the management and production of short leets. It says nothing about long leets, which would be produced by the education authority in the normal way. There is merely provision for the board to add or remove names as it considers appropriate. It is not correct to say that the right of veto remains. The veto proposed in our original consultation paper was the right to reject a candiate once he had been selected by the education authority or the appointments body. It was rightly pointed out to us that that would cause unnecessary discontent and division, and that it would be better for the board to exercise its view at an earlier stage. That is the purpose of the provision.<br><br>
I am disappointed that the hon. Member for Dumbarton did not address himself to amendment No. 163, on which I would have been interested to hear his arguments. The minimum leet provided to the appointments committee is two and I do not know why the hon. Gentleman seeks to increase that to three. Perhaps he is worried that the boards might capriciously reduce the number of candidates going to the appointments committee. That would be undesirable. The provision is for a minimum of two because we would expect the post to be re-advertised if there were insufficient candidates. I should like to hear what the hon. Gentleman has to say about amendment No. 163, as I may be able to help him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Moonie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I fail to see the logic of the Minister's objection to the amendments. He proposes that members of a school board, who will not have played a part in the long leet interview, and who will not have had the benefit of interviewing the candidates in depth—unlike the professionals who make the selection from the long leet interview—will merely have before them the limited amount of written information that can be provided and, on that basis alone, will delete a name from those recommended. In my experience of education committees, it is unheard of for the lay body—the councillors in this
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 458</span>
instance—to delete a name from a leet. It may request that a name be added, if it has been left off, if it wishes to consider that person. I appreciate that that would be legitimate. But to say that, without the benefit of having interviewed a candidate, the school board would refuse to have a candidate on the leet beggars belief.<br><br>
I cannot understand why the Bill contains this provision. There is neither logic nor sense to it. With the information that would be before it, the board would not be competent to make such a decision. The Minister should think carefully about the clause. The way in which the amendments have been structured provides a means of protecting the professional judgment of the education authority staff. It is fair and reasonable for the board to wish to add a name to a leet, and this has happened when councillors have been involved in making a choice. It is not reasonable for it to be able to delete a name. Surely that calls into account the professional credibility of the staff who have reached a judgment. I feel that the Government have made a mistake.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: School management guidelines on the consultative process state:
<br><blockquote><p>"To avoid difficulty over the appointment of a headteacher boards should have a power of approval on a shortleet rather than a 'veto' on appointments."</p></blockquote>
The Minister has given the game away. He is saying that the difference between the power of approval and the power of veto is that the board can reject before selection instead of afterwards. In essence, the power is the same, so the Governemtn have not given away anything.<br><br>
In the previous debate, the Minister used the worst case example, which he said was Central region. I do not know whether that is true. Let me give a worst case example. I have the advantage of living on the east coast of Scotland. I was brought up, however, on the west coast, so I know that there religious background assumes considerable importance, especially with schooling. There are Catholic schools throughout Scotland, but in many of them there are non-Catholic teachers who are trying to make their wy up through the career structure. The Minister appears to be opening up the possibility that non-Catholic teachers who have worked for many years in a Catholic school may apply for a senior post and may be approved in the long leet process by the education officials and by the head teacher. They may also have the support of the staff. However, Catholic parents on the school board might not wish to have non-Catholics in senior posts in the school. They would have the power to delete the names of non-Catholic applicants before their names went forward on the short leet. The Minister ought to address himself to that problem.<br><br>
There was a recent case—this operates against the Labour party although I do not know the details—in which a Scottish National party member applied for a post with an enterprise board. There was a row about whether he was rejected on the basis of his party political background. That could well happen with a school board if a party political group took over the school board and rejected an applicant purely on the basis of his political background.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I1004">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 459</span>
The Minister has to consider these possible problems. He has given parents a majority on school boards and the paretns will decide which candidates' names are allowed to go forward to the short leet. Parents are human beings and sometimes they act from prejudice, as we do. Applicants could be rejected for short leets for entirely unprofessional and wrong reasons. The Minister must tell the Committee whether an applicant would have right of appeal, and to whom he could appeal, if he were rejected by a school board and he believed it to be on religious grounds.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister asked me to address myself to amendment No. 163. My boss—my hon. Friend for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg)—pulled my shirt and told me to invoke the fifth amendment, but I shall not do so. I considered amendment No. 163 to be subsumed within amendment No. 171, and perhaps did not give it the significance which it deserved. The amendment would delete "2" and insert "3". There are fewer appointments to senior positions in a school than to the level of principal teacher so the inclusion of "3" would guarantee a more widespread choice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) is worried that appointments of senior staff in denominational schools would be subject to a religious test. That has been the position in Scotland since 1918. Under section 21 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980, the heirarchy has a right to approve candidates. The position is much more onerous than that which would arise in respect of school boards.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I entirely accept that there has always been a provision that the hierarchy has the right to approve candidates. But it has almost been unknown—certainly in my experience in Tayside—for it not to approve a candidate because of his or her religious background, although there might be other reasons for doing so. The deputy director of St. Xavier's high school in Dundee, where I worked, comes from an old Catholic background, but there was no bar to him taking up that position. Groups of parents might take a different approach, however. The Minister opens up to each school board the opportunity to exercise the right to delete names from a short leet, and that is entirely different from the hierarchy having to approve candidates. Indeed, it should approve non-Catholic candidates to take up posts in Catholic schools.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should no doubt be out of order, Mr. Knox, if I pursued this subject. But I am sure that the hon. Gentleman's colleague—the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall)—will inform him of the position at a later date. The hon. Gentleman is wrong to say that there have never been challenges. Indeed, there has been litigation between the Scottish Office and the hierarchy about the extent to which the use of powers under the 1980 Act is reasonable. The arugment has centred on whether reasons should be given for refusing
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 460</span>
approval. But let us not pursue that subject. I merely mentioned that by way of information so that the hon. Gentleman knows the background.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Moonie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Nothing in the schedule refers to the Church in relation to denominational schools and the right to ensure that Catholic candidates are of sufficient standing in the Church. That is the distinction. It is the right to ensure that Roman Catholic candidates are of good standing in the Church, not the right to refuse a non-Catholic a post. The distinction is subtle but real. By and large, the power is used by the hierarchy not to reject non-Catholics but to reject Catholics who, for some reason, failed to behave appropriately within the tenets of the Church. But there is a risk because the schedule does not appear to specify the special position of denominational schools—for example, the right of a member of the Roman Catholic church to be a member of the board of appointment, which would always be so in an education committee appointment. There are one or two problems with denominational schools which are not covered by the schedule.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The two words which the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy (Dr. Moonie) should remember are "eligiblity" and "suitability". In denominational schools, the question of eligibility would arise if some candidates did not meet the statutory requirements. There is no need to provide for that in the Bill.<br><br>
I tried to be helpful to the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) on amendment No. 163. The hon. Gentleman argued that there should be at least three candidates. We set the figure at two because in some circumstances—especially, for example, in small rural primary schools—there might be only two candidates. If the amendment were accepted, the board would be unable to make an appointment until there were at least three candidates. That might involve extensive re-advertising and result in an impasse.<br><br>
5.30 pm<br><br>
In my continuing helpful way, I am prepared to reconsider the matter in an endeavour to find a way that will allow three candidates to go forward and a mechanism to deal with instances when there are fewer than three candidates. We shall use our best endeavours to that end. I cannot accept the amendment because, apart from anything else, its drafting is technically deficient and does not deal with the problem that we had in mind. I should point out that these are minimum figures and we do not expect the minimum to be put forward. We expect the board's right to remove candidates to be used with discretion; it should not be used in a way that would anticipate the decision-making process of the appointments committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Moonie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed that the Minister has not responded to the issue that I raised. I wondered what justification he has for giving the school board the power to overturn the professional advice of the officers of the education authority. It
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I1005">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 461</span>
seems odd, and I have never heard of a case in which it has happened, with the effect of shortening rather than lengthening a leet.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy (Dr. Moonie) will forgive me. I think that the answer was provided by the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) when he made his impassioned plea for decisions to be taken by those who are accountable. It is right and proper that members of the board, who are elected, should have an opportunity to take a view at an early stage on the candidates whom they consider inappropriate and whose names they should be able to remove from the list. The hon. Gentleman argues that this challenges the professional judgment of the education authority. If we followed that line of argument, we would not bother to have elected members or parents; we would leave it to the office holders of the education authority to decide. I thought that there was agreement across the Floor of the Committee that that was not right. Indeed, the hon. Members for Dundee, East and for Dumbarton argued that what happened before 1974 was not acceptable. The hon. Member for Dundee, East may argue that we have the balance wrong, but I am sure that we are travelling in the right direction.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If an education authority were an equal opportunities employer, would anyone who was refused a place on a short leet by a school board on ethnic or religious grounds have a case against that education authority?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We discussed the matter earlier when the hon. Gentleman was discussing the contractual relationships between boards and outside bodies, the responsibility of education authorities, and the extent to which members were personally liable for their decisions. They would be personally liable if they were involved in taking decisions which were not taken in good faith. If someone capriciously removed a person from the short list for the reasons that have been suggested, it would be difficult to defend that action as being consistent with acting in good faith.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for that reply. He seemed to be saying that school boards would be acting outwith their powers if they took an applicant off the leet merely because that person came from a specific ethnic or religious background. I am pleased to hear that it would not be within their powers to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As members of the board involved in an appointments procedure they would be expected to act in good faith and to take decisions consistent with their statutory responsibilities and with the wider responsibilities of the education authority. I do not understand how acting in a prejudiced manner against specific candidates would be consistent with that wider responsibility.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to hear the Minister's comments on amendment No. 163. He has taken our fears into consideration. I take his point about rural

schools and accept that he will take our proposal away and do his best.<br><br>
We do not take the same view on amendment No. 171. We envisage the power of veto existing only at an earlier stage, with the power to remove or to delete applying at the short leet rather than at the appointments stage. It is a fundamental sticking point and we wish to press the amendment to a Division.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negaived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 162, in page 18, line 4, leave out paragraphs 16 and 17 and insert—
<ul>
<li>"(16). The appointment committee shall, unless they consider that no person on the short list is suitable for the post, make an appointment; other than where the preferred candidate for a headteacher appointment was not on the short leet submitted by the authority but was added by the School Board.</li>
<li>17. Where the preferred candidate for a head teacher appointment was not on the short leet submitted by the education authority the Appointment Committee will recommend the candidate to the authority. The education authority will appoint that person accordingly unless it appears to them that the candidate is not, for good reason, eligible or suitable for the post, in which case they may refuse to appoint him.".</li></ul>
Although the stages in procedure differ between the selection of a head teacher and that for a deputy or assistant head, they conclude with an identical procedure involving interview of the leet by the appointments committee and the subsequent recommendation on an appointment by the committee to the education authority.<br><br>
The recommendation to the education authority seems largely unnecessary. It would be in the interests of all concerned if the procedure could be short circuited so that the appointments committee was empowered, if the preferred candidate had been included in the original leet by the education authority, to make an immediate appointment following interview without further reference to the authority. The procedure would automatically include all posts for deputies and assistants, along with the majority of head teacher appointments.<br><br>
The only appointments not covered by this procedure would be those where the preferred candidates had not been included in authorities' short leets but had been added by the decision of school boards. In those circumstances it would be appropriate to safeguard the position of an education authority in terms of its statutory responsibilities by including a reference-back clause requiring confirmation by the authority. If the reference is to be meaningful, it should be made on the bases of eligibility provided in the Bill and suitability to

permit a proper assessment of the candidate's qualifications and capabilities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must aske the Committee to reject the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Oh!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg) exclaims, but when I said that we would try to be helpful on one of the previous amendments he chose to press it to a Division. I think that I may feel that my overtures have been spurned by Opposition Members.<br><br>
First, the amendment suggests that in most cases an appointment committee should make an appointment. The Bill has been drafted specifically to allow education authorities to preserve their rights as employers. I know that the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) is concerned about that. I do not need to remind the Committee of the anxieties that were expressed during the consultation period about boards not becoming employers of staff. It is important that the appointments are made by employers.<br><br>
It is important for the Committee to distinguish between eligibility for a post and suitability. Under the schedule, a candidate is eligible if he or she satisfies the relevant statutory criteria. In most cases, that simply means being registered with the General Teaching Council. The suitability of a candidate is a more subjective matter. The authority will have its view of what makes a candidate suitable and the board will have its own view. There will also be professional criteria such as desirable specialist qualifications to consider. The schedule allows the authority to declare its view of the suitability of candidates by drawing up a short leet. The board then has the opportunity to express its view by revising the short leet if it wishes. The appointments commiteee then has the final say, based on the revised short leet.<br><br>
As the committee is made up of half authority and half board nominees, the authority has the chair. In the last instance, therefore, it is the authority's view which prevails. The committee is only required to make an appointment where a suitable candidate exists on the revised leet. If it is not satisfied that the leet contains a suitable candidate, it will have to demand that a new leet be drawn up. Therefore there are considerable checks and balances throughout that process. As it is the authority's view of the suitability of the candidates on the final leet which rules the game, it is unecessary to provide for the authority to have yet another opportunity to reject the selected candidate on grounds of suitability. In effect, the authority would be double-guessing itself. As I said earlier, "suitability" also covers professional criteria. That is why the schedule makes provision for the director of education to advise both the board and the committee in the exercise of their functions under the schedule.<br><br>
The schedule is complicated and it is difficult to see the whole process. I can understand that reading paragraphs such as paragraph 17 in isolation may
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 464</span>
give rise to concern. Seen on its own, that paragraph appears to impose a duty on the authority to appoint a candidate regardless of the authority's view of his suitability. However, within the context of the procedure as a whole, that is not the case. I hope that this explanation will be helpful to Opposition Members and that they will be prepared to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We were trying to be helpful to the Minister by short circuiting the point. In the light of the Minister's explanation, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg leave to move amendment No. 67, in page 18, line 15, at end insert
<br><blockquote><p>"except when the deputy or assistant headteacher is acting headteacher in the absence through illness or other cause of the headteacher".</p></blockquote>
I am not sure that the Minister will appreciate that this is, in a sense, simply a technical amendment. I seek clarification from him about what the circumstances will be in the event of the sickness of the head teacher. An obvious possible reason for recruiting an additional head teacher is because the existing head is sick. Is there a chance for the assistant head teacher to take on the role that otherwise would be taken by the head, and are there circumstances in which the acting or assistant head teacher would effectively take over the role of the head for any length of time?<br><br>
5.45 pm<br><br>
The amendment is self-explanatory. It agrees with the schedule as drafted but it seeks to make exemptions when a head teacher is absent due to illness and the assistant or deputy is standing in. I hope that the Minister will understand our proposal. The schedule leaves matters unclear. This means that school representation is removed or that the local authority takes places that are empty. The amendment is a probing device to ask the Minister what will happen in circumstances where a head teacher is ill, especially if he is ill for any length of time and the deputy or assistant acts in his stead.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This matter is difficult but straightforward. The hon. Gentleman has expressed strong views on the importance of the head teacher, and I agree. The Government believe that the head teacher should have a substantial role in the selection of his staff, especially the senior management team of his school. For that reason, we do not consider it appropriate that a deputy stands in his stead in making such appointments, which is what the hon. Gentleman's amendment would allow.<br><br>
I agree that it is not ideal that if the head is ill the apointments committee cannot sit, as the Bill proposes. However, I do not envisage a great problem where there is extended absence of a head teacher. There is nothing to prevent a vacancy that might arise being filled on an acting basis pending the head's return. I accept that it is not satisfactory to have two senior posts filled temporarily at one time, and no

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 465</span>
doubt the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) will leap up to say so, but it would be undesirable for members of the senior management of a school to be appointed in the absence of the head teacher. I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a probing amendment. I hope that I am not thinking too fast on my feet, but there seems to be practical problems. For instance, how does an appointment committee find a chair if the head teacher is seriously ill and unlikely to return for a long time? I do not wish to raise difficulties, but such circumstances could arise. The Minister may feel that the Bill should provide for them. Otherwise, confusion could arise. Either no appointment can be made for some time, or the committee has to meet without a chairman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The appointment committee cannot meet without the head teacher being there to chair it. I assumed that the hon. Gentleman was trying, in his amendment, to allow it to meet without the assistant, deputy or head teacher taking the chair. It would not be appropriate to accept his amendment because it is important that the head teacher be in a position to influence the appointment of his senior staff. As to the initial functions and continuing day-to-day activities of the school in the absence of the ability to constitute an appointment committee, there is no reason why someone should not be appointed as acting assistant head until the head teacher returns to his post, or is replaced if he resigns due to illness or for any other reason.<br><br>
There are no great practical difficulties, but I agree that it is not an ideal situation for the head teacher to be absent from the schol and for a senior post not to be fully appointed, with someone acting on a temporary basis.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to delay the Committee, but I am still a little worried because I can envisage a situation where a head teacher might have a stroke, for example, and be incapacitated for a significant length of time. The Bill seems to make no provision to deal with that situation. If there is such a provision, I shall be happy to be referred to it. If there is not, I hope that the Minister will acknowledge that although those circumstances may be exceptional, they are statistically possible and in time are bound to occur. It is reasonable to hope that the Bill could be adjusted to take account of them.<br><br>
The amendment is not contentious. I am merely anxious to ensure that the Minister and his officials who draft the Bill have contingency arrangements to ensure that we are not left in a limbo without any resolution. If he Bill does not deal with the issue, perhaps the Minister will consider whether it should do so. If it does, I should be grateful if he would point out where.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not true that the Bill does not deal with the matter—it simply does not go for the solution that the hon. Gentleman has put to the Committee. I have explained why I think that that would be unreasonable.<br><br>
Paragraph 3 of schedule 2 says that<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 466</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"Any vacancy occurring in the membership of an appointment committeee (other than a vacancy resulting from lack of a headteacher, in whose absence an appointment committee to which paragraph 2(b) above applies may not be constituted or sit)".</p></blockquote>
Thus, the Bill deals with the circumstances in which a head teacher is not available by saying that an appointment committee may not sit. No appointments can be made until a head teacher is available. It would be possible for people to act in those posts, but their appointments would not be confirmed until they had been confirmed by the committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When the Minister said that, it struck me that a situation could arise, as happened in Dundee, where a head teacher becomes ill, steps down temporarily and then decides not to come back. Meanwhile, the post of the acting head teacher, who may have served for a year, cannot be confirmed until an appointment committee sits, but how can an appointment committee sit when there is no head teacher to take the chair?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is what I have been explaining to the Committee for the past 10 minutes. In the absence of a head teacher, no appointment can be made. Someone could be put in the capacity of acting assistant or deputy head. If the head teacher's absence from the school is extended, the period in which the post is not properly filled will also be extended. The education authority would have to decide what to do in the circumstances. It may consider early retirement for the head teacher or whatever the circumstances dictate as being appropriate.<br><br>
The reason why I advise the Committee not to accept the amendment is that we think that the head teacher should have a substantial role in the selection of staff, and it would not be right for staff to be selected in his absence by one of his deputies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy with that basic point and I do not wish to press the amendment. We have identified a lacuna in the Bill. I do not ask the Minister to accept the amendment, but I hope that he will consider the matter. There are circumstances such as those that I described with which the Bill does not seem to deal adequately. That could lead to problems—certainly over the years. I hope that the Minister will take note of the comments that have been made. If at a later date, after consultation with his officials, he thinks that he can improve the Bill to take that into account, I for one should be grateful.<br><br>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That this schedule be the Second schedule to the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Moonie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before we finish our discussions on the schedule, perhaps the Minister will clarify one or two matters. First, is he satisfied that the schedule answers the education legislation act in terms of the rights of the Roman Catholic church in appointments to denominational schools? If not, will he undertake to ensure that it does so when it comes back on Report?<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I1008">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 467</span>
Secondly, will the Minister explain how the schedule fits in with the legal procedures which a regional council goes through before an appointment is ratified? That is, the education committee ratifies the decision of an appointments committee; the regional council then ratifies all decisions of its committees and can make any change that it considers fit. Are both those procedures superseded by the terms of the schedule?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that I can help the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy (Dr. Moonie) on both questions. The schedule simply establishes for the first time, a national scheme for the appointment of senior school staff. It does nothing more and nothing less. Also for the first time, it provides a guaranteed role for the head teacher. The rights that the Catholic church enjoys in respect of denominational schools, arising from the 1918 settlement, are not affected. We are simply establishing a statutory basis for appointments which provides for involvement by school boards and education authorities. I hope that my reply reassures the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Moonie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am still not satisfied that the schedule is competent as drafted; it should specifically refer to the rights of the Church hierarchy in those appointments—especially if the Minister's answer to my second question is what I think it will be. Will the normal approval procedures still be gone through—namely, that an appointments committee decision must be ratified by the education committee and that all decisions of the education committee have to be ratified by the regional council?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the hon. Gentleman if I was discourteous in not picking up his second question. I was distracted by other things. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the Catholic church. The education authority is required to appoint someone who has been selected by the appointments committee, if that person is eligible. Clearly, criteria of eligibility could include membership of the General Teaching Council for Scotland and so on. But such a person would not be eligible for appointment in a denominational school if there were an objection in accordance with the legislative rights which the hierarchy enjoys in respect of appointments. As I understand it, the usual procedure is for the education authority to discuss with the hierarchy—at an early stage—the various candidates on offer. They would be considered early on in the process—rather than later, which could clearly cause grief and embarrassment. Objections were made to our original proposals, which were described as the right of veto for school boards. Therefore, the education authority and the board would ensure that the candidates under consideration met the criteria of eligibility. Ultimately, the responsibility for appointing lies with the employers—the education authority—and the obligation is on it to be sure that those selected are eligible for appointment. There was a second point—</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 468</span>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Moonie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The way in which committee decisions are ratified.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. Knox, I am being very stupid. The hon. Gentleman said "The way in which committee decisions are ratified", and I would like him to remind me of the question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Moonie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At present the procedure is that the appointments committee makes a recommendation to the education committee that an appointment should be made. The education committee has the right to say no. Is that right being taken away?<br><br>
The regional council has the right to refuse to approve a minute, or a proceeding, of any sub-committee of any committee. Is that right now taken away?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Paragraph 17 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Where an appointment commitee recommend the appointment of any person to a post to which this Schedule applies the education authority shall appoint that person accordingly, unless it appears to them that the candidate is not eligible for the post in which case they may refuse to appoint him."</p></blockquote>
In other words, the commitee can not appoint him only if he is not eligible. In that sense the responsibility lies with the education authority in respect of eligibility, but the selection is made by the appointments committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Moonie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: So in this respect the term "education authority" means both the education commiteee and the regional council.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The regional council is the education authority but the education committee is usually delegated the powers to carry out those responsibilities.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is great merit, Mr. Knox, in arriving in time to learn such things.<br><br>
We have discussed schedule 2, which was difficult and important. Many of the questions asked and

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 469</span>
answered were difficult to follow, but this is a simpler matter.<br><br>
Clause 12 is supported by Opposition Members, but it leaves open the question of how often the board reports to parents. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"as often as appears to the Board to be necessary."</p></blockquote>
I am not too happy with that. There should be a statutory requirement on the board to report at least once each year—each academic year, each session of the school—so that parents can be informed on these matters and their views obtained. That is no more than what usually happens. I accept that the boards will draw up their own rules and standing orders, that will be in line with guidance from the Department and from the education authority. That being so, it would be helpful if we made it incumbent on the boards to report annually to parents informing them of the boards' activities.<br><br>
If there is an objection to that suggestion, I hope that it will not exempt the boards from being expected to make such a report. I trust that some requirement will be placed upon them to report. We should write the provision into the Bill, and the amendments meet that requirement. If they are technically deficient, we shall not press them on the understanding that the point will be considered, but I should like to believe that the boards will be required to report once each session. That duty would be consistent with other aspects of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have some sympathy with the amendments. The Bill does not provide for annual reporting because—dare I say it?—we have observed the operation of this requirement in England with boards of governors. I appreciate that the amendments do not say as much, although they have invented the term "session" which has no legal meaning.<br><br>
If there is no important issue or topic of great substance to be discussed, an annual set-piece reporting process can become an annual grind which is not supported by parents and which does not create the necessary conditions for boards to thrive, prosper and command support. I was reluctant to place on boards a statutory obligation to do something once a year or to produce an annual report. Such a provision tends to be a formula of this place. It is easily written into legislation, and it is the reason why every day of the week our post is burdened with such glossies, which I am sure that most of us drop into the wastepaper basket. Even now I see the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) holding up an example. They are the result of Ministers being weak enough to accept amendments in Committee that on first sight seem sensible.<br><br>
We have not adopted the approach suggested by the Opposition, but it will become obvious from clause 13 that we have placed on the boards a general duty to promote contact between the school, parents and the community and to report on their activities. That is a better way of meeting the aspirations of the hon. Member for Cumbernald and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg) in his amendment than writing a rigid provision in statute. However, if the hon. Gentleman wishes to argue about the amendment, I shall be happy to hear his point of view.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 470</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to argue about it. I have made the point and I leave it at that. In the light of the Minister's remarks, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
PARENTS' MEETINGS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcom Bruce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 62, in page 8, line 10, at end insert—
<ul>
<li>"(c) one quarter of the teaching staff of the school; or</li>
<li>(d) the headmaster.".</li></ul>
I think that the purpose of the amendment is self-explanatory. The amendment is designed to give more equal representation to education and teaching staff representatives who are associated with the board. Clause 13(1) deals with securing a special meeting of the board and states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Where a School Board receives a request in writing from—
<ol>
<li>30 parents of pupils in attendance at the school; or</li>
<li>a number of such parents equal to at least one quarter of those who were entitled to vote at the most recently-held election of parent members,</li></ol>
whichever is less, they shall hold a meeting under this section."</p></blockquote>
The provision gives some parents a right to demand a meeting to discuss issues, but no such right appears to be available to staff members of the board or to the head teacher. The amendment simply tries to ensure a balanced approach.<br><br>
The circumstances in which such meetings arose would be relatively rare, but there might be occasions when the teaching staff was unhappy about some aspects of the board or when the head teacher wanted to hold a special meeting of parents because he felt that the board was not necessarily representing or articulating the views of the wider cross-section of parents. That, I understand, is the motivation behind the amendment.<br><br>
I suspect that the Minister will say that he believes that parents who elect their representatives in a majority on the boards should have the right to call a special meeting and call their representatives to account. Given the structure that he proposes, which he knows I do not wholly accept, perhaps that is not unreasonable, but it does seem unreasonable to deny a similar right to other people who are equally concerned.<br><br>
The Minister may wish to qualify the circumstances in which that would apply, but it be appropriate if the teaching staff or the head master were in a position to test whether the opinions that had been pushed through by parent representatives on the board were genuinely representative of the wishes of parents, and, in some circumstances, had the right to call a meeting. I believe fundamentally that the board ought to be a partnership between parents and teaching staff. In that context, it is right that the way in which it is structured and the question of the right to call public meetings should lie not only with parent represenatives but with the staff or the head master. That is the purpose of our amendment, which I feel is straightforward. I look forward to

hearing the Minister's comments on giving that balance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is all far too radical for me. I have to advise the Committee not to accept the amendment. The principal purpose of the school boards is to provide a forum for parents. Staff and head teachers already have their place in the education management process. As an employee of the education authority, the head teacher is the line manager of the staff. He has agreed rights of consultation with the authorities on starring and other issues, and there are joint councils with the authorities on pay and related issues. Those lines to the authority outwith the remit of the board are important. They mean that the head teacher has no need for a statutory right to call an open meeting. The head has the right to give his board advice, but, by virtue of his independence of the board, he can refer directly to the authority. I see no need for the amendment. I understand why the hon. Gentleman was tempted to go further, but in doing so he has missed the reasoning behind the Bill, having been carried away by the concept of general meetings and participatory democracy beyond the Bill's purpose. I hope that he will seek leave to withdraw his amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have had the reply that I expected. Again, as a matter of principle and philosophy, I do not see much point in detaining the Committee.<br><br>
Having read the Bill, I feel that by not accepting my amendments the Minister might in effect be creating a position in which teachers—heads or others—might get round my proposal by seeking to lobby the requisite number of parents to ensure that a meeting is called. The Minister appears to accept that and obviously is not especially concerned because the parents will decide whether or not to co-operate. Given that there is no objection to that, it may be of some elucidation or encouragement to the head or the other teachers to know that a way can be found of getting their position across.<br><br>
Nevertheless, I articulate my concern that there could be at the heart of the problem circumstances in which a school board is taken over by a minority, political or religious, or one that represents a clique or group in a school. The teachers may be the only people who are aware of the implications and it may be left to them to try to alert other parents and persuade them to take a closer interest and demand a meeting. However, I fear that I shall make little progress in persuading the Minister because this is a matter on which we are fundamentally at odds. It is perhaps the crux of the difference in our approach to the way in which the board should operate and even to the issue of parental majority as opposed to a partnership between teachers and parents.<br><br>
In the circumstances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<br><blockquote><p>"either by sending it by hand of a pupil in attendance at the school or".</p></blockquote>
I shall not repeat the arguments about sending communications to parents by means of schoolchildren. There is a big difference between sending an envelope containing a letter by means of a five-year-old and handing a letter to a pupil aged 17 or 18. We have already accepted that this is an inappropriate means of distributing ballot papers, and it is equally inappropriate for the purpose of calling a meeting. If the board calls the parents together for the purpose of discussing a matter of importance, it does so because the matter is important, and if standing orders require—as I am sure that they will—that parents be given two weeks' notice, 10 days' notice, or whatever, there is a risk of that requirement not being fulfilled if a child puts the envelope into his schoolbag and then forgets about it. I am not a parent, but I have asked a few parents about their experience of envelopes that are handed to children. We talked about the Hampstead boy when we were discussing ballot papers, but since then I have heard various stories about letters being thrown away or falling out of schoolbags three weeks later. On other occasions, the child worries about the letter, thinking that it contains something about him.<br><br>
We have already said that ballot papers will be sent by post. That is surely better than handing letters to children. I am not a lawyer, but even I can see that that method is not tight enough from a legal point of view. I strongly urge the Minister to accept the amendment or at least to take it away and think about it. Certainly, we should not place responsibility on children for matters which are important to the school and to the board.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do have children, and I well know what happens. It also happens with Members of Parliament. Occasionally at functions I am given letters which I discover in my suit two or three weeks later. I then have to blame the Scottish Office for the delay in replying. I take the point entirely, and I am happy to accept the amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Our purpose is to find out what the Government have in mind. The amendments

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 473</span>
propose to leave everything with the authority because we do not want considerable variations in charges in a locality where there may be several schools. In my constituency, there were great increases in the numbers of children in specific places, because new towns bring in people for whom houses and schools are built. Now we suffer from the problem of falling rolls, because the community has grown old and the children have moved on. But there are many schools. Some are close to one another and it would be inappropriate to apply different charges so that, for example, boy scouts at one school had to cough up much more money than those at another school nearby. What do the Government have in mind? I want to be reassured that nothing will be detrimental to the functioning of local groups and that the clause is intended to facilitiate the use of the school as a community resource. I shall be interested to hear the Minister's comments on the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Moonie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish briefly to add to the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg). I am worried about the clause for one good reason. The community provisions in most modern schools are paid for not only by the regional council but by a substantial contribution from the district council. In turn, the district council is entitled—as of right—to serve on the management committee for community use of a school. I am worried that that right will no longer be automatic. Monies are provided by the district out of the rates and I am concerned that their say in how those monies are applied will be lost. Will the Minister comment on that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that I can reassure the Committee. Our original proposal was that the general control over out-of-hours use of school premises should rest with school boards. However, representations were made about several practical and detailed considerations, which we took into account. That is why we provide, as a starting point, for the local control exercised by the boards to be subject entirely to direction by the education authority.<br><br>
Amendment No. 175 would limit the flexibility provided in clause 14. It would give boards at the outset only an advisory role in the use of premises. That is unacceptably restrictive. The power of direction which clause 14(1) provides to education authorities already gives them a high degree of control. I hope that my reply satisfies the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg).<br><br>
Amendment No. 176 seems to make little sense. Under clause 14(1), the authority can already direct the board in its exercise of functions. It is therefore difficult to understand why further control is needed.<br><br>
Clause 14(1) specifically includes within the scope of possible future delegation the authority's function of fixing charges for the use of school premises in its area. At the outset, the board will be wholly subject to authority direction. The provisions in amendment No. 165 are therefore unnecessary. The authority can require any monies collected to be remitted. The amendment would merely restrict room for future
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 474</span>
delegation. That would be wrong in principle and might not be in the authorities' own interests.<br><br>
Under the Bill, as drafted, the fixing, collection and disposal of charges would be one aspect of control over the use of premises which could be delegated to a board. But one thing is clear—there would be no net financial benefit necessarily to be gained by a board being able to retain the charges which it collected. Clause 17 requires an education authority to allocate an appropriate sum to cover a board's expenses. If the board retained charges, the sum involved could simply be deducted from the total allocation. What seems most likely would be for an education authority to divest the comparatively trivial task of collecting charges on to the school board, which could retain some of the revenue as petty cash. I should not wish to speculate on whether boards will wish to be involved in the mechanics of collecting charges. However, it is right that each board should determine its own view on the matter. The amendment would merely limit—unnecessarily—the scope for delegation. I therefore feel bound to reject it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Moonie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand what the Minister says. The issue that worries me, and which I have raised several times, is a community's right to take part in a school by using its buildings and facilities, rather than such use being discretionary, whether at the discretion of the school board or of the regional authority. I accept the constraint of being able to afford such use because there are costs involved, but it is possible to include in the clause a provision to ensure that the community's right to use the buildings is respected.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is our purpose. Subsection (1) says:
<br><blockquote><p>"and shall encourage the use of those premises by members of the community in which the school is situated."</p></blockquote>
The provision places a specific duty on school boards to encourage such use.<br><br>
The hon. Genleman said that it should not be for the education authority or the board to decide, but someone must determine how a school is used. We cannot have anarchy or the bridge club would be fighting the gym club, and so on. Someone must act as referee.<br><br>
I completely agree with the hon. Gentleman that our school buildings are underused. They are a resource that could be more widely available to the community. As for expense, the marginal cost is insignificant and the marginal benefit is enormous. I am at one with the hon. Gentleman. We have gone as far as we feel able to go in clause 14(1) by placing a duty on boards to see that school premises are used by the wider community.<br><br>
One of the most wounding attacks on our proposals was to have various organisations allege that the provision would somehow reduce the scope for community use of school resources. On the contrary, we envisage such use being part of the functions and benefits arising from the creation of the boards.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. No such people are present. The only people present are those within the actual debating chamber.</span></p>

In the light of the Minister's remarks, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Moonie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 166, in page 9, line 9, leave out subsection (2) and insert—
<ul>
<li>"(2) Every School Board may make representations with regard to the fixing of occasional holidays during school terms to the education authority who shall take account of those representations and shall reply to them.".</li></ul>
This is an interesting provision—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Apparently not!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Moonie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take it as a personal affront that a person who is not in the Room should leave the moment I rise to speak.<br><br>
Clause 14(2) is one of the few attractive features of the Bill. It says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Every School Board shall have power, after consulting their education authority, to fix occasional holidays during school terms."</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister explain exactly what he means by "occasional"? The amendment is slightly more restrictive. It says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Every School Board may make representations with regard to the fixing of occasional holidays during school terms to the education authority who shall take account of those representations and shall reply to them."</p></blockquote>
I believe that there are minimum provisions as to the number of attendances that must be made at a school and I should be worried if they were infringed by clause 14(2).<br><br>
The Law society says:
<br><blockquote><p>"We can envisage difficulties with the operation of this sub-clause, especially where one working mother, having children at different schools, requires to make arrangements to cover differing 'occasional holidays'.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>We believe that there should be a limit on the number of occasional holidays which Boards can fix. Such provision might be made by regulation.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>We also believe that regulations should make provision to govern the length of notice which is required before fixing such occasional holidays.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>We note that the Board has the power to fix such holidays 'after consulting their education authority'. There is no obligation actually to take note of the views of the authority."</p></blockquote>
The society suggests that sub-section (2) should read:
<br><blockquote><p>"Every School Board should have power, after obtaining the approval of their education authority, to fix occasional holidays during school terms."</p></blockquote>
6.30 pm<br><br>
I may be one of the few people here who has benefited from the ability of local school managers
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 476</span>
to fix occasional holidays. It was the practice in Stornoway, where I was raised, that if the weather was particularly inclement the school could avoid the legal necessity at that time by fixing a double attendance whereby a child stayed on at school until 1 o'clock instead of 12 noon, was deemed to have attended for the afternoon and given the rest of the day off to wend his way home through the rain, snow, hail or whatever. That was most inconvenient for parents who had prepared lunch for 12 noon in the expectation that their children would be coming through the door.<br><br>
So I have some experience of the ability of local management to fix a school holiday, albeit an irregular one.<br><br>
Will the Minister take seriously the points made in our amendment and by the Law Society? I can see the point about the principle, but it might prove difficult in practice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I viewed the clause as drafted with a little concern and I believe that the amendment modifies it slightly.<br><br>
The Minister will be aware of my questions but, certainly in rural areas even now, given the changing patterns of work and schooling, for example, the existing fragmentation of local holidays in Scotland gives rise to comment that is not always supportive and quite often adverse. To give another body the opportunity to add to that confusion when we should be looking for ways to tidy it up seems a little inappropriate.<br><br>
I received direct representations at my constituency surgery last week about this clause, and I shall give a typical example that applies to many people in my constituency. I, of course, have such holidays as Members of Parliament get related to English and London holidays which take no account of Scottish school holidays or anything else. My son goes to school in Aboyne six miles from our home in Torphins and my daughter, who is deaf, goes to the school for the deaf in Aberdeen which is 25 miles away. Aboyne, Torphins and Aberdeen apart from Christmas and New Year's day never have the same holiday, so holidays for all practical family purposes are no use whatever.<br><br>
If we add to that complication the possibility of school boards designating additional holidays, that will not be greeted with enormous enthusiasm. The hon. Member for Kirkcaldy (Dr. Moonie) related the oher side of the coin for people who have working commitments such as single parents, working mothers, and so on. Additional holidays that do not coincide in any way with their working pattern are a cost, a difficulty and a complication which make life more difficult.<br><br>
None of us wish to be killjoys and deny the justification for having local holidays, but the amendment puts the issue slightly more in perspective in that it seeks to ensure that some mechanism is available to ensure that we do not have a proliferation of conflicting holidays. I do not suspect that there will be extra holidays—further confusion will simply be added—when the general
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I1013">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 477</span>
public demand is for tidying up holidays on the basis of simplification.<br><br>
The old argument was that it was a great idea for Stonehaven to be on holiday so that people could shop at Inverurie because it was not on holiday, but the shops are open 367 days of the year in any case. While it may be possible to split the difference and have some local holidays and some regional holidays, it is unacceptable for different primary schools in different rural areas, probably within the catchment area of a secondary school to be on holiday at different times. To put it simply, if a parent has two children, one at a primary school in one rural area and another at a secondary school a few miles away, if the two school boards designate different holidays and the children are off at different times the family will not benefit from those holidays. I do not believe that the children will benefit either. I do not wish to be a killjoy, but I think that the amendment has some merit in trying to co-ordinate and tidy up the situation, as the public wish.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take the point about the need to tidy up the existing fragmentation, especially for parents who have to fit in with school holidays, but the Minister as a native of Angus will know that there are sometimes good reasons for particular local holidays. The Angus tattie holiday is one of the most renowned in Tayside. I am sure that the Minister has taken part in the Angus tattie holidays and has picked tatties in the fields for farmers in that area. He will recall that before the 1986 regional council elections the Tory administration in Tayside sought to tidy up the holidays and to stop the Angus tattie holiday so as to bring Angus into line with the other districts in the Tayside region. As a result, the Tories lost the election. Some people believe that the reason why they lost their grip in Angus and why the Scottish National party still controls the district is that the Tories tried to interfere with the traditional tattie holiday and upset the people of Angus.<br><br>
The Minister may be doing the same thing, because individual school boards will be able to decide not to have the tattie holiday. One school may allow the children time off to pick the tatties, but another school may not. That would not be good for the people of Angus, who have clearly expressed through the ballot box their preference for a tattie holiday for the whole of Angus, and have elected the only party which offered them that possibility.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am reminded that on the "Today" programme the other day there was an item on eccentrics. One was a man who ate nothing but potatoes and described his view of the world as potatocentric. The hon. Genleman's speech in favour of the amendment was certainly potatocentric.<br><br>
I cannot accept the amendment. I shall break a habit in the Committee and not accept an Opposition amendment. A pathological hatred of variety again seems to be emerging from the Opposition. The notion that there should be different holidays is anathema to them. They are trying to regiment schools. Even the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) tried to convince us that parents would not
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 478</span>
take into account the holidays being organised in both the secondary and primary schools. I have more faith in the judgment of parents about their own interest than I have in central bureaucracy and education authorities. The notion that the authorities organise the holidays for the convenience of parents is wrong.<br><br>
I have here a letter from parents of pupils at Currie high school. It is part of a regular stream that comes into the Department from parents. In the case of Currie high school there was the usual petition with the signatures of many parents. They complain that the education authority changed—arbitrarily, it would seem—not the holidays, but the school hours. Children would start at 8.30 am and that would create a half-day on Wednesday, and so on. The final paragraph is the most revealing. It says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The notification of the change in hours came last of all to the parents of the High School children. We feel we should have had some earlier indication and involvement in such radical changes. The feeder Primary School parents should have also been informed of these changes and most certainly the parents of Primary 7 children should have been notified as their children are due to begin at the High School in June."</p></blockquote>
That happens all the time.<br><br>
In my constituency the Maclaren high school council has been trying for seven years to get a reply from the education authority to its request to change a holiday from Monday to another day. It is not true that the holidays are always arranged for the convenience of shopping in Inverurie or wherever. Authorities often organise holidays on different days for different schools so as to accommodate teachers on in-service training courses because this allows the instructors to cover several schools at once. Holidays are therefore often organised for the convenience of the education authority, and they often cause considerable inconvenience for parents.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Moonie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"Every School Board may make representations with regard to the fixing of occasional holidays during school terms to the education authority who shall take account of those representations and shall reply to them.".</p></blockquote>
It is not much more severe than the Minister's proposal, but it provides some form of ordered system. Will the Minister define "occasional holidays"?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Occasional holidays are taken occasionally.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Moonie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In addition to the standard holidays throughout the year, the education authority fixes what are sometimes called occasional days, or extra days. Are these to be covered, or will the provision give the board authority to fix occasional days in addition to the occasional days that the education authority has already determined?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am advised that the answer is that the Schools (General) (Scotland) regulations 1975, as amended, require 195 school days in the school year, and that occasional holidays are the days that are left over when the authority has decided on the term holidays. However, I prefer my earlier explanation.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 479</span>
The Opposition's amendment is rooted in their objection to local variety. The hon. Member for Kirkcaldy said that his amendment was acceptable because the education authority would have to take account of the representations. Let hon. members tell the people in Maclaren high school in Callander that Central region, which is also expected to take account of representations from school councils, has responded to their request. They have sent letters for seven years and do not even receive a reply. The only way that education authorities will take account is if there is provision in the Bill that school boards may take the decision but are required to consult the education authority before determining local holiday arrangements.<br><br>
The board is required to ensure compliance with its authority's duties in this as in all other aspects. If the authority required a particular day to be a holiday Monday, perhaps becuse it was consistent with its obligations to provide in-service training, the board would have to take account of that, and respond. The aurhority and the board will have regular dialogue. There will be exchange between them and there will be opportunities, perhaps through links with other schools, for discussions.<br><br>
It is extremely patronising to suggest that parents sitting on school boards, or teachers or co-opted representatives on boards, will not look to guidance that is given by local authorities and will not take account of what other schools are doing when considering the question of holidays. I find if difficult to accept that there will be chaos if variety is permitted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish <span class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for this late intervention, Mr. Knox. You were probably hoping that I would not intervene.<br><br>
I am fascinated by the concept of the word "occasional". The Minister has responded to interventions by saying that it is important that the school board makes a judgment if in-service training is involved. I agree because it is appropriate at the local level of the training. I hope that the Minister will forgive my ignorance—I am always on the learning curve—and explain the distinction between what in Fife we would regard as floating public holidays, and an occasional holiday if we remove the matter of in-service training?<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy talked about chaos. Is it possible that each of the 200 schools in Fife could opt for a different day for a holiday that was conceived by the education authority, following representations from industry and commerce, and for the purpose of achieving harmony in the area? That is a hypothetical question, but I should like to be certain as to what "occasional" means.</span></p>
<p>6.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) was here when I read out the definition of an occasional holiday.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Knox.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 480</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Whatever else it is, it is not a point of order, and I think that the Minister has given way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister has been charitable in that respect, I shall be more charitable than I intended to be. I should like the issue to be attacked, not me. I heard the Minister reading out his definition, but it did not clarify the point. What is an occasional holiday in relation to a public holiday in relation to an in-service training day?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: An occasional holiday is a public holiday if the education authority decides to make the public holiday an occasional holiday for the school. "Occasional holidays" are the days left over after the authorities have decided on the term holidays, given that they are required to have 195 school days. If they choose the local trades holidays as one of those holidays, the two would coincide.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister can put the matter in perspective if he can explain the Sma' Shot Day referred to in early-day motion 1107, which says
<br><blockquote><p>"That this House congratulates Renfrew District Council on resurrecting Sma' Shot Day as a traditional working class holiday in Paisley and Renfrewshire, finds this particularly appropriate in the current year, the 500th anniversary of the Paisley Borough charter;"</p></blockquote>
—burgh is spelt wrong—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: So much for Paisley grammar.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed—
<br><blockquote><p>"and further remembers the historic meeting of the Paisley Weavers to which this holiday is dedicated."</p></blockquote>
Would the Sma' Shot Day be an occasional day within the meaning of the Bill?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be open to the school board, having consulted the education authority, to determine whether the Sma' Shot Day should be allocated as one of the occasional holidays for the school. But if we accepted the amendment, school boards throughout Paisley and Renfrewshire would have to persuade the education authority to take account of their representations and allow them to have the day. In view of the origins of the day, I do not imagine that that would be too difficult.<br><br>
For all those reasons, I hope that I can persuade the hon. gentleman to withdraw the amendment. I can reassure Opposition Members that chaos is more likely to come from arrangements that are centralised than from arrangements that are left with parents and boards, acting in their own interests and those of the community as a whole.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Moonie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister will comment on the case where the education authority fixed all the days that were available as term holidays and therefore left no occasional days, above the 195. Would that mean that there would be no discretion open to school boards?<br><br>
Then there is the problem of linked in-service days—a concept with which the Minister is clearly
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I1015">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 481</span>
unfamiliar, because it came in as a result of the pay award last year. The concept of the linked in-service day is that several schools in an area have the day off to take advantage of training arrangements that have been made.<br><br>
The third matter that I ask the Minister to consider is the enormous public opposition that there will be to this provision. I have had scores of representations in the past from people bemoaning the fact that holidays vary from place to place within the region—not only from individuals, but from business and commerce and from people running factories. They all deplore the fact that there is not a little more standardisation available. This is not my personal prejudice. Society as a whole would like it.<br><br>
Moreover, there are no regulations governing the conditions under which boards would be allowed set such regulations or banned or proscribed from doing so. Perhaps the Minister could briefly reply to those question before we finish.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If there is great public pressure it will be applied to the representatives on school boards. I am sure that they will respond with action that parents at Maclaren have been unable to achieve with Central region. The process will be direct.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman may be right to argue that there is widespread concern. Such fear is an indictment of the present system, which we are seeking to change, and for the reasons that I have explained I think that it will be improved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Moonie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is making it worse.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asked whether an authority could use all days as term holidays. I suppose that it could, but it would be a pretty stupid
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 482</span>
education authority that did so because it would have no flexibility.<br><br>
I have already referred to in-service training, and it is one reason why boards are under an obligation to consult education authorities about their proposals.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Moonie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In this respect boards are under no obligation to take heed of what education authorities say. Purely through intransigence a board could easily ruin the chance of a useful in-service training period for three or four linked secondary schools.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not correct. I said, as the record will show, that the board was required to ensure compliance with its authority's duties in this area as in others. If an authority wished to designate a specific day and the board did not, the purpose for which the authority wished to use the day would determine whether the board would be right to proceed anyway as the hon. Gentleman suggested. If the authority's purpose in specifying a certain day was to fulfil its wide duties, the board could not charge ahead. The hon. Gentleman can be reasonably relaxed on that matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Moonie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will there be regulations?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. There is no need for regulations because the boards are required to consult the authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Moonie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
