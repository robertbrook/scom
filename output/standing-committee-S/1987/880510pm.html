	<div class='page-header'><h1>School Boards (Scotland) Bill</h1></div>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 2</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>COMPOSITION OF BOARDS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed [this day].</i> No. 44, in page 2, line 10, leave out paragraph (a).—	<i>[Mr. Norman Hogg.]</i></p>
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are also discussing amendment No. 46, in page 2, line 24, leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>"variation of regulations made under this section or".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was explaining why I thought that the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg) was wrong to seek to enlist our support to put on the face of the Bill provisions about the composition of school boards. I was about to reassure him that we would consult on the detail of regulations before they were made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals for membership of boards are not new. The proposals contained in the paper that I circulated to members of the Committee are the same as those in our consultation paper. It is untrue to say, as some have claimed, that the proposals have been sprung on an unsuspecting world. Let me remind the Committee what we said in our consultation paper in August 1987. The relevant passage reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Boards should be small enough to be effective management bodies. Parents will have a clear majority of voting members. In addition, there will be one (or in larger schools, two or three) representatives of the staff of the school and two or three co-opted members representing the local community. Thus the boards would have between seven and 13 members, depending on the size of the school."</p></blockquote>
In the course of our consultation, there were few complaints about the boards being too small. Most of the criticisms that we received took the line that was taken by the Opposition in Committee until we reached this point in the debate, namely, that we would have difficulty in finding sufficient candidates to stand. We had little complaint that there was insufficient staff representation. On the contrary, the complaint was that we were making unreasonable demands of staff in expecting them to take part in the work of the boards.
	<span class='label label-info column'>276</span>
Nevertheless, I shall take careful note of the points that have been made by my right honourable Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) and Opposition Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the paper that I circulated to the Committee, I described the detail of our intentions. I say "intentions", for that is what they are. I shall give no undertakings now about those intentions, not because the Government are irrevocably committed to the details of the membership structure that I outlined but because we intend to consult widely about them. I shall take note of what has been said here today, and in particular I can reassure my right honourable Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside that I shall take on board what he said. I shall also take note of a wide range of views from authorities and other interests. When we have made our decision in the light of those views, the regulations will be brought before the House and it will be open to hon. Members to seek further debate on them, if they wish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I understand the anxieties of Committee members, I am certain that that is the appropriate way to proceed. It would be extremely unfortunate for us now to put provisions on the face of the Bill and to learn from experience later that that was a mistake. The proposal in the Bill provides for opinion to be consulted and for us to learn in the light of experience. Having given these undertakings, I hope that I can persuade the Opposition to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cumbernauld and Kilsyth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not go as far as the Minister hopes and say that I am persuaded. Nonetheless, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McFall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 48, in page 2, line 34, leave out subsection (4) and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(4) A person who is eligible for election to a School Board both as a staff member and a parent member cannot stand for election in both capacities.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 41, in page 2, line 34, leave out subsection (4).</p>
	<p>No. 53, in page 2, line 34, leave out from "as" to end of line 36 and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"both staff and parent member may opt to stand for election in either capacity".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The provision in the Bill is inherently unfair and undemocratic. A person might teach in a school and have an interest in it as well because he or she has one child or more at the school. The Bill therefore has a completely illogical aspect. Will the Minister please explain why some people are ruled out simply because they are staff members? After all, a staff member may have an insight into the school and could perhaps contribute to the working of the school board. But as the provision is drafted, some people will be disfranchised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0906">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>277</span>
The Minister speaks of giving power to people and decentralising decision-making. Therefore, he should not place strictures on who can or cannot stand for election, particularly a staff member. The overwhelming right of people to stand should not be blocked by the provision. We tabled the amendment because of that democratic issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Lewis Moonie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kirkcaldy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I reinforce the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall). It is fundamentally unfair to disfranchise some parents from standing for election to school boards, and I cannot understand why that has been proposed. I agree that a teacher might have the opportunity to be a staff representative, but surely that would not mean that he or she could act purely on behalf of his or her—or other people's—children. If elected, such people would be more likely to take the official line on a matter of policy. That would not be so with a parent who is elected, be he or she a teacher or not. A democratic right will be taken away from some people and the Minister must provide good justification for so doing. We should all have the right to have a say in our children's education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, teachers who have children at school may well have more knowledge than other parents about what is happening; they may have more interest and be more likely to participate and to vote than—I am sad to say—the apathetic majority which we might face when setting up the boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A good example is a case in my own area of two children at the local secondary school. The father is a member of the directorate of the education department and the mother is a teacher at the school. Under the proposals, the father would be entitled to stand for election as a parent representative but the wife would not. That is ludicrous. If anything, a member of the directorate is more likely to be biased, or to take the official line, than a teacher. I wish to hear the Minister's comments. I hope that he will be reasonable and understand that it is fundamentally unfair to exclude a small number of parents from the democratic right to take part in elections to the boards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, shall be brief. I hope that the Minister will clarify one or two specific issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recently in the Scottish press we have heard a great deal about the new Conservative policy of positive unionism for Scotland. Part of this positive unionism will be to offer real devolution to the people of Scotland by measures such as the Bill, which contains devolving powers to parents in Scotland to run the schools that their children attend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister let slip—whether intentionally I do not know—that it has always been his intention to transfer the management of schools to school boards. It is important that we get everything absolutely right with the new local centres of power that the Minister is establishing. If he genuinely wishes to set up local centres of power to give parents control, he must be scrupulous in setting down the rules and regulations on
	<span class='label label-info column'>278</span>
elections to school boards and on who is entitled to stand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No doubt the Minister will try to explain why a teacher with a child at the school will not be allowed to stand for office. Will he also explain why that teacher will be allowed to take part in the ballot to elect a teacher representative to the board? Why will the teacher also be allowed to participate in the ballot to elect the parent representative to the school board, but be debarred from standing as a parent representative, even though he is otherwise entitled to do so?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There must be a good reason for the arrangement. If it is all right for a teacher who is also a parent to have two votes, why can he not stand for the office of parent member of the school board? He can sit on the board as a teacher representative but not as a praent representative. Surely it is for parents at the school to decide whom they wish to represent them. It should not be laid down by the Minister, the House of anyone else whom parents can or cannot vote for to represent them on school boards. If the Minister seriously wishes to devolve real power to the people of Scotland, surely he should allow parents to decide for themselves whom they wish to represent them on the new school boards. He should not say that they cannot elect this teacher or that teacher.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not a small matter. I think back to my direct experience in Tayside. When the then Conservative-controlled authority shut down three primary schools in Dundee, people who taught at and whose children attended those schools were among those who led the fight against the closures. They mounted a highly effective campaign, much to the chagrin of the Tory members of the council. These councillors were frustrated and they threatened all kinds of dire consequences to their employees who stood up to and challenged the elected representatives on the council. There were muttered threats from the council but no direct action was taken against the teachers. However, it was discussed at council meetings whether teachers should be allowed to criticise the authority for which they worked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had an interesting debate on the issue this morning. The hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) took part, but he did not refer to the example in his own back garden of what happened when members of his party criticised the authority's employees for taking a different line from the authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must assure the Committee that there is no malevolent influence in the provision that prevents parents from deciding for themselves whom they should elect to represent them on school boards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is not an easy argument and we have thought about it carefully. We made the categories of membership exclusive to avoid the possibility of boards becoming homogenous. Although the Government want boards to have a parental majority, it would not be desirable if they were composed entirely of parents or, for that matter, of teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position is straightforward. A parent who is also a teacher is eligible to stand as a parent member in a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0907">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>279</span>
school in which he or she does not teach. Parents who teach in the school can stand as teacher members. Far from being disadvantaged, someone who is a parent and a teacher at the same school will be able to vote for both the teacher and the parent representatives. That position is privileged in comparison with that of most parents. I should have thought that the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) would end his enthusiasm for extending that privilege.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not breaking new ground, as is clear when we consider the eligibility of teachers to stand for election to a regional council. No doubt the hon. Gentleman will cite the co-option of teachers on to education committees as an argument against that, but although they can be co-opted they cannot stand for election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) is not with us, so I do not know whether I should say anything about the other amendment. For the convenience of the Committee, however, I shall do so. That amendment suggests that we inject into the system a choice so that individuals could decide whether to stand as parents or as teachers. The hon. Member for Gordon appears to accept the principle of our proposal but has suggested a variation. The parent who is also a teacher at the same school will inevitably view issues with the same professional eyes as he uses in his daily work. The purpose of the boards is to inject into the system the clear lay voice of the parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Gordon has rejoined us, I shall repeat a little of the argument. We recognise the ingenuity of his amendment offering individuals the choice of standing as parents or as teachers, but the Bill's fundamental purpose is to enable lay people to contribute and to provide a forum for parents within the school system. For too long that has been denied. Parents who are teachers in the school will necessarily see issues and the operation of the school through the same professional eyes as they use in their daily work. When I visited Denmark to observe the Danish system I was minded to adopt the option suggested by the hon. Member for Gordon, but I was struck by the strong advice that the Danes gave as a result of their experience. I accept that the arguments are finely balanced, but it is important to maintain the balance within the school boards. If we accepted either of the amendments that balance would be put in jeopardy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gordon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First I apologise to the Minister and the rest of the Committee for being a little late due to other commitments both in and out of the House. I presume that the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg) moved my amendment, or at least referred to it, because the Minister is dealing with it. I appreciate that, because it is a serious amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. When amendments are grouped together only the first is moved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take that point, Mr. Knox, but having not been here at the appropriate time I appreciate the Minister's response. He has got his retaliation in first. His comments were reasonable and constructive. My only additional comment is that I am anxious about a
	<span class='label label-info column'>280</span>
genuine situation that could arise in rural areas. In a school that has more than one teacher but is nevertheless in a small community there could be a problem if a teaching parent who was the second or third teacher at the school did not have that opportunity and other parents had the final say because they can determine whether they wish to elect a person with this background and expertise. My additional question, which the Minister did not answer, is whether he accepts that that could be a problem in rural areas and whether he will be prepared to allow for the fact that in small rural schools there could be a circumstance or mechanism for a dispensation to be given. I am thinking of circumstances in which the parents say, "There is a candidate who we think could be useful. There is no other candidate of comparable ability and we should be allowed to choose."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendment seeks merely to allow parents to choose a parent from among them who happens to be a teacher at the school. There is also the basic point that parents who are teachers are in a sense being disfranchised unless they happen to be able to teach at a different school from that which their children attend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Gordon raised the issue of mechanisms. I stayed away from that because of the practical difficulties of implementation. If we went down this road, we would need to provide for people to choose the category of election for which they would stand. That would need to be recorded and notified to the education authority. If they decided to change from one category to the other, or if they resigned from one category, would it be appropriate for them to continue to have their votes as teacher and parent representatives? If they opted to be parent representatives, that also would have to be recorded. The idea of a simple exclusion option is more complex than it appears. I understand the hon. Gentleman's point, but I must tell him that we would be introducing into the system additional burdens on local authorities—I know that he is sensitive about that—with no great advantage. As the amendment is drafted, it appears to seek to allow any parent to stand as a staff member.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I press the Minister on that answer? He appears to be going against democracy by excluding certain people and I should like to know his reasons. There could be a situation in which a teacher at a school could be a co-opted member. Certain individuals such as clergymen who teach at schools could be co-opted as religious representatives, so we are crossing boundaries. Why does the Minister insist that a person who is a staff member cannot stand in another category? The staff member could be co-opted. Why, for example, does the Bill prevent, say, a clergyman being a co-opted member?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have already discussed this. Each category is mutually exclusive. No one can co-opt a person who is eligible for election either as a parent or as a teacher. I made this point when we discussed the question of a Church representative being co-opted as of right. This was one of the difficulties, which is why the two amendments were tabled together, with one
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0908">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>281</span>
following on from the other. If a Church seat were to be created, we would have to remove the principle of exclusivity between the various categories of election so as to make the first amendment consistent with the principles of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked me why we take this view. It is because we think that it is important. Opposition Members argue about whether a parental majority is needed but their argument is based on the principle that no group should be able to dominate the school boards. This provides a protection to ensure that no group can dominate a school board, although parents will have a majority. It avoids the creation of a homogenous body by co-option or by people standing for election in other categories.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise to the hon. Member for Gordon for not answering his question about very small schools where no school board would be convened. It is a quite important matter, because when numbers are insufficient to form a board under clause 20(4), parents are entitled to information as though they were board members. We expect real practical difficulties, and I am happy to give the hon. Gentleman an undertaking that we shall look at this matter, without giving any commitment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not satisfied by the Minister's explanation. He said that teachers would not be allowed to serve as parent members because the Government do not want them to do so. He has provided no justification for the argument that it would be detrimental to a school board to have teachers serving on it as parent members. Teachers, after all, will be as accountable as any other parent member of the school board and will therefore have to take the wishes of other parents into account. It will be possible for a teacher at a different school to be a parent member of another school board. The Minister is again leaving it open to one group to take over. If he assumes that teachers will act as a homogenous group, surely a teacher from another school will act just as homogeneously as one who teaches on the same staff.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am content for the electorate—that is, parents—to take a view on the matter. The hon. Gentleman said that I did not advance any arguments; I thought that I advanced a number of arguments. However, I shall repeat the principal argument that underlies our approach to this group of amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The boards are there to provide a forum for lay people—the parents—in the school, and we have sought to provide them with a majority, to protect that majority, and to protect the overall balance of the school board. If we were to allow teachers in a school who were parents, that balance would be in jeopardy. The hon. Gentleman tempts me to extend the provision to prevent all teachers from standing for election. That is what happens now in local government, because all teachers are excluded from standing for election to the education committees as fully elected councillors. So my view is more liberal than the principle that has operated hitherto in local government, and the hon. Gentleman should acknowledge that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>282</span>
Double standards seem to be emerging in some of the Opposition's arguments. On the last group of amendments there was the great argument about the head teacher as the chief executive not having a vote. I look forward to hearing Opposition Members arguing that chief executives of local authorities should be given votes in committees from now on. They should look at the basis of local government and at what we are providing for school boards before making the comparisons that they sought to make.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It appears that the Minister is trying to think on his feet. That is a dangerous thing to do. He is suggesting that there is a correlation between the chief executive of a local authority and the head teacher acting as chief executive on a school board. The difference is, of course, that a chief executive of a local authority is accountable to that authority, whereas the head teacher will not be accountable to the board. He is not employed by it, as the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) said, and that is a significant difference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must not get drawn too far as we have already had that debate. The hon. Gentleman must know that he said that the head teacher was accountable to the local authority and he made much of that. Indeed, we had a long discussion about what should have happened at Paisley grammar school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If there is an inconsistency in the arguments, it is on the Minister's part. I must make my position clear. I should be equally opposed to excluding teachers from another school as teachers from the same school from serving as parent members. The Minister talks about wanting a majority of lay people on the board. He should consider extending that rule to other teachers if he wants to be consistent. How can a teacher be seen as a lay person at one school but as a teacher at another? That is nonsense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman urges me to go further down that road. School boards will not discuss what is happening at the school down the road. School councils did that. That is why they were not supported by parents. School boards will be interested in matters involving their schools. A teacher in one school may be a parent at another and may wish to stand for election to that school board. But deliberations will centre on what is happening at that school and not the one down the road in which the person teaches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman may be right in arguing that such teachers will have a professional view, but they are more likely to behave in a way that is consistent with the concept of providing a forum for parents. The hon. Member for Kircaldy (Dr. Moonie) makes a debating point. It is a matter of balance and I felt that this time the balance of argument justified giving the teachers the benefit of the doubt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Far from being a matter of balance, it is becoming increasingly clear why the Minister is determined not to allow teachers to stand as parent representatives in the schools in which they work. He

drew an interesting parallel when he said that teachers cannot stand for election to the regional councils. There is a good reason for that. The education authorities employ teachers and it would be wrong for someone to be an elected member of an authority that employs him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 	<i>The Scotsman,</i> we read today that the so-called ceiling powers have been ditched because of the influence of the Secretary of State for Scotland over the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State. The Secretary of State has succeeded in watering down the original proposals whereby school boards would have become the employers of teachers at the schools. That is why the Minister is holding out. It is not a question of balance. The Minister will get his own way in the end and he intends that school boards should become the employers who will sack and appoint teachers, so it would be wrong for teachers to sit on school boards. The Secretary of State for Scotland will eventually be sacked by the Prime Minister, as happens to everyone who has talent in the Cabinet. When the Secretary of State gets his come-uppance, the Under-Secretary of State will bring in his real proposals to beef up the boards. That is why he is holding out on this one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will not expect me to reply to much of his speech. If he examined the Bill, he would find specific provisions to exclude teacher members from being involved in those appointments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the parent-teacher members?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not for the parent-teacher members, but for appropriate reasons that prevent teachers from standing for election as members of regional councils. I sought to show that there was a parellel in local government and that the balance was more in the teacher's favour. That is not because we have examined it in those terms, nor is there a great Machiavellian plot in train, as the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) seems to suggest. We have considered the matter from the point of view of the individual school, which is why the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy is right to point to the apparent paradox in our approach. If it is examined in the context of individual schools and the boards for those schools, it is a credible and reasonable position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister spoke about the chief executive becoming a member of the council. But the difference between school boards and councillors is that school board members are not liable for any actions that they take. They are acting in good faith and the council picks up the bill. That is the fundamental difference between councillors and the proposals for school board members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is protection for liability, but it has the usual condition attached to it that the members are acting in good faith.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 73, in page 3, line 4, after "commencement of", insert "section 1 of".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is purely a drafting amendment to bring clause 2(9) into line with clause 2(3)(c) by referring specifically to the commencement of section 1 of the Act rather than to the Act as a whole. As the notes on clauses suggest, the intention is to commence difference parts of the Bill at different times, and a general reference to commencement could be misleading.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kincardine and Deeside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 30, in page 3, line 7, leave out subsection (10) and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(10) A Board shall, at its first meeting after the election of members, co-opt members in accordance with subsection (1) above and adjourn thereafter until such time as the co-opted members have been called to a meeting for the conduct of other business.".</p></blockquote>
I do not think that I need to detain the Committee, but I seek clarification on the procedure when boards are established. We have in earlier debates acknowledged the important role that co-opted members will play in representing a community on a school board. As I understand it, the first job of the board will be to agree the members who will be co-opted on to it. Theoretically, the board could proceed on to other business. As there would be a quorum with parents being in the majority plus the elected teacher members, the board could start to conduct business without all members being present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assume that the board would not meet formally to undertake business until the co-opted members had had the opportunity of attending. It is not the most earth-shaking point that we shall consider in our proceedings, but little practical matters can count. People can be frustrated when they find that Parliament has overlooked some small matters, and I hope that it has not done so in this case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the point of my right honourable Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith). We intend that the boards should co-opt their members before proceeding with business. There may be good practical reasons why that is not possible. Members may wish a person who was not available for a short time to join the board. Although I understand the thrust of my right honourable Friend's arguments and am sympathetic to the amendment, I wonder whether it would be appropriate to include it in primary legislation. It would be more appropriate if the amendment were to be reflected in a board's standing orders. We could include the substance of the point in the guidance that we give to education authorities about the setting up of boards if that will help. Therefore, I ask my right honourable Friend whether he is prepared to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I would be prepared to do so. It should be recognised that guidance has no power. I hope that boards would not behave mischievously. For their own success, boards would be right to wait to carry through business until they have their full membership. But that is not a fundamental

point. As my hon. Friend the Minister has undertaken to include the point in the guidance that is issued to the boards, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No.1, in page 3, line 17, leave out "auxiliaries" and insert "non-teaching staff".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 25, in page 3, line 17, leave out "auxiliaries involved in education" and insert "non-teaching staff".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although it is No. 1, the amendment is not momentous. However, it demonstrates the assiduity with which my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Monro) and I have approached the Bill. We have tried to find practical points as well as some of the more fundamental ones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I seek clarification from my hon. Friend the Minister about the definition of school staff that appears in clause 2(13). I assume that amendment No. 25 has a similar purpose in that it seeks to establish what is meant by "auxiliaries involved in education". Do they include laboratory assistants, or do they include other school staff such as the person whom I regard as almost next to the head teacher—the Scottish jannie, who is often the stalwart of many schools? Even highly respected headmasters sometimes have to vie with the jannie for disciplinary respect. I do not suggest that we should list all the classes or groups of staff employed in schools, but I would appreciate clarification of how far the term "staff" extends and why.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 25 has precisely the same intent as amendment No. 1, which was moved by the right honourable Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith). There is an unfortunate omission in the Bill, which we should examine now to see whether it can be rectified. It is complicated by the Minister's advice on the number of teachers serving on boards and the formula that he has devised for that purpose, which seems to exclude from membership of a board some people who are much involved in the management and organisation of schools who are staff members and thus important to the school. They appear not to have a role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am surprised at the way in which "staff" is defined in the Bill. Subsection 13 says that it means
	<br><blockquote><p>"teachers, instructors and auxiliaries involved in education, but does not include the headteacher."</p></blockquote>
But several categories of staff are not mentioned in the Bill at all, such as laboratory assistants. Large secondary schools usually have a team of secretarial staff and, in some cases, a quite senior administrative officer. They are not included in the Bill. Neither are
	<span class='label label-info column'>286</span>
the janitor and his staff, nor the cleaners who are acountable to the janitor. That adds up to a substantial number of people who have an interest in the school but are not covered by that definition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to think that the Minister intended that the whole school would be represented on the board: teachers, community, Church, parents and pupils. But some people are excluded, so perhaps a drafting error has occurred. I hope that the Minister will admit that and propose a formula that will allow members of those categories of staff to be elected to the board if they so desire. If they wish to be represented independently or by the teacher, that would be fair enough because we wish to ensure that the school as a whole is represented and nobody is left out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be a great mistake to disfranchise the janitor. As someone said to me over lunch, a board may decide whether to let the hall on a particular might, but if the janitor says no, that will be the end of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may be interested to know that in my experience running a youth club in a secondary school the most distinguished janitor I remember was a Mr. Hogg.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can assure the Committee that we Hoggs have found our way to very distinguished offices, including that of school janitor. My experience of janitors is that they are extremely helpful, and I would go out of my way to keep in with them when running surgeries and so on. For example, in Holy Cross primary school in Croy, I can rely on Pat Campbell to have the tea ready when I arrive even if the constituents have not arrived. That makes him a mighty important man to me on Saturday mornings. Janitors fulfil an important role and they are well known to children, parents and staff. It would be a mistake to disfranchise them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned the administrative staff and school secretaries, whose role is to support the head teacher and heads of departments in ensuring that the school is properly managed, runs smoothly and opens every day. To overlook them will simply underline the feeling that they already have, that they are not recognised in the same way as teachers in the school. I hope that the Minister will accept that they, too, play an important role in the administration of larger schools. It would be wrong to leave them out of the head count of those who may represent the staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My remakrs are not meant to suggest that the role of the teacher representative on the board should be diminished—it is crucial that teachers are represented as of right—but extra space should be found on the boards, especially of larger schools. I hope that the Minister will consider that point sympathetically.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: After my hon. Friend's eloquent discourse on the role of the school janitor, I do not have much to add, except to relate an interesting anecdote. A well-known headmaster visited his junior school, met a child involved in some nefarious purpose and asked, "Do you know who I am?" The reply was, "I think you must be the jannie, sir." That has little relevance to the present subject, so I shall leave the matter there.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0911">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>287</span>
Several categories should be included in the definition of staff. Schools have a growing tendency to employ a librarian, who will be important, especially considering the school board's role in supervising the purchase of books and materials. I particularly want to talk about the role of special needs staff. The term "auxiliaries" does not cover that group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support 100 per cent the growing trend for children with special education needs, through physical and mental handicap, to be in mainstream education wherever possible. For children with a multiple handicap, that entails the employment of an assistant—possibly an old nurse or a nursing assistant—whose duty is to supervise one, two, or even three severely handicapped pupils to ensure that they are capable of surviving in the general school. Much as we want every school to have such provision, there are often logistical reasons why that cannot be. The obvious example, which has been quoted ad nauseam, is Paisley grammar school, which is unsuitable for pupils with a multiple handicap because it is an old building that cannot be modified to enable such pupils to survive. Merksworth high school is a modern building and fully able to take its complement of disabled pupils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of costs, it is often necessary to concentrate those pupils in a few schools, particularly primary schools. Rather than have one pupil in each primary school in a town, three of four are often placed in one school. That gives the assistants employed to look after the pupils an important role in the school. The numbers are small, but that is all the more reason why they could be included in the definition of staff entitled to vote or to sit as members of the school board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not that raise the question of peripatetic teachers who deal with special needs? Not being involved in the school full time, they are not necessarily the most appropriate teachers to be included, but in some schools in my constituency peripatetic special needs teachers are held in enormous respect, particularly by the parents of the children to whose special needs those teachers are devoted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right honourable Gentleman makes an important point. Peripatetic teachers have an important role to play, particularly in rural areas, but they do not appear as members of the staff of the school. They are employed directly by the education authority. As they teach part-time in the school, they will be excluded from serving as parent members, due to the Minister's intransigence on the previous amendments, and debarred from serving a possibly useful role as staff members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the Minister to include those groups. They do not comprise a great number compared with the total staff, so their inclusion should not distort the Bill's intentions too much. Perhaps we could hear the Minister's thoughts on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assumed that the amendment of right honourable Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) was to tidy up a drafting mistake. The Minister can do nothing other than accept the amendment. One of the difficulties is that in Scottish education the term "auxiliary" has a
	<span class='label label-info column'>288</span>
precise meaning. When I read subsection (13), I assumed that Scottish Office advisers had used a shorthand term to describe all the other staffing activities that take place, not just in large schools but in a range of schools throughout the Scottish education system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of other staff have been mentioned—janitors, cleaners, domestics, technicians and secretarial and administrative staff. Increasingly, there is also an interface between nursery units and nursery schools within a primary school which would have a bearing upon a representative forum within any school board. I assume that as a definition, "auxiliary" does not in any way tackle the problem—and hon. Members mentioned many more people who deserve to be at least considered for involvement on the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will also be aware that on college and school councils in education authorities at present, there is a role for the teaching staff and for the non-teaching staff, so they are represented on each of those councils and there is no dilemma such as there is when one member who is a non-parent has to be appointed and a choice must be made between a non-teaching or a teaching staff member.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will be aware that in schools which have up to 500 pupils or between 501 and 1,000 pupils, only one staff member is on each of the boards. If the Minister accepts the more reasonable suggestion, there will still be only one staff—or non-parent—member on boards of schools of those sizes. That could lead to problems in identifying whether that member should be a teaching or a non-teaching member. If—as I am sure he will—the Minister accepts this amendment, he may want to consider further how many staff should be on the boards in order to avoid the dilemma of selecting one group of staff or another. Both groups play an invaluable role within the school and contribute to the overall well-being, not only of the school, but of the community, as my hon. Friend the Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg) suggested when he defined the role of the school janitor. That may seem to be a trifling point, but it is clearly an important aspect and the janitor may wish to be involved in the work of the school board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not my intention to organise an attack on jannies and I have listened carefully to the arguments that have been put in their support. Our intention, as is explained in the notes on clause 2, was to try to set the definition of "staff" widely enough to include instructors and auxiliaries who might not be encompassed by the usual interpretation of "teacher" but would have a similar interest in the educational aspects of the school. However, I must confess to the Committee that it was also our intention not to set the definition too widely, since on particularly small boards—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Shame.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On small boards particularly, there would be a limit on the number of potential staff members. The hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg) half-acknowledged that at the end of his speech by saying that he hoped that an extra
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0912">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>289</span>
place could be found for them, but he did not address his mind to the effect that that would have on the overall composition of the boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have listened carefully to the points that have been made, but I am not inclined to extend the definition of "staff" to include everyone in the school. However, I am prepared to look again at subsection (13) and to consider whether it could be amended to include a clearer definition or whether detailed guidance should be given to education authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we extended the definition to include all staff in the school, there could be difficulties in smaller schools, for example, where the domestic staff might, in terms of simple numbers, outweigh the teaching staff. Not only would they be eligible for election, they would also be eligible to vote. So there are wider considerations. The staff involved in teaching should be directly involved in the boards. That does not exclude other staff. Subsections (3) and (10) of clause 6 allow boards to seek advice and representation from outwith their immediate structure. That is, perhaps, the janitor clause—it might enable representation and involvement, if that were considered appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having listened to the views of my right honourable Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) and the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth, my instinct is to look at the definition, but not with a view to opening it as wide as the hon. Gentleman perhaps envisages. I have to say to my right honourable Friend that I do not see how I can include janitors in the school board membership, other than through clause 6(3) which provides for them to be involved in advisory committees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed at the Minister's response. However, he hinted at a qualification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the wording of the Bill, there is a sense of personal pride in all who contribute to the welfare of the school, whether on the social or the educational curiculum. I suspect that the various trade unions representing the non-teaching staff will consider the clause to be a slight on the non-teaching contribution. I shall not dwell on that, but there is a personal aspect to consider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More importantly, it is at present an accepted part of the provision in Scotland in relation to both school and college councils that there is acknowledgement of the work by the non-teaching staff on the social and educational curriculum, so the Committee would be accepting tradition if the amendment were accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be ridiculous to divide on the amendment. However, I ask the Minister to be a bit more specific and forthcoming and say that he will consider the matter further, without any commitments about the definition of non-teaching staff. As a result, we could have an opportunity to discuss this part of the Bill later in its passage through the House. If the Minister could assure us that he would consider sensibly the proposals made from both the Conservative and Opposition
	<span class='label label-info column'>290</span>
Benches, that might be enough to prevent a Division. If not, I hope that there will be a Division, because an important point of principle is at stake.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I more or less said that. The key test is the term "involved in education". A number of groups of people were singled out, such as librarians, nurses and other assistants in classroom work. They are clearly included because they are involved in education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Janitors are a bit more difficult. I suppose that it could be argued that a janitor who was helping the school football team was involved in education. That makes me think that perhaps we should see whether subsection (13) can be amended to provide a clearer definition. However, I shall not be helping the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) if he is looking to me to extend the opportunities for janitors to stand as teacher members, for the reasons which I have explained. I have not heard a strong argument to support that, given the difficulties which would be created in small schools with smaller boards and limited places for teacher members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister was going some way to accommodate us before he said that no arguments have been made for a wider definition. I accept that he will look at the matter. In view of the Minister's passion for liberty and freedom surely we must arrive at some flexible definition which would assume that non-teaching staff were being considered and were part of the definition of staff. That is all that we seek. If the definition were widened it would allow the particular board to say that within the school there are non-teaching and teaching staff and because they know more about the school than the Scottish Office or the education authority they have a right to take that definition and select accordingly. I hope that the Minister will give us an assurance about that in his deliberations with advisers over the next few weeks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That illustrates the inadivisability and weakness of these regulations. A school of between 500 and 1,000 pupils which is the average size in my region—Strathclyde—will have only one member of staff on the board. If the definition were widened so much there could be no teaching representative. If the Minister is thinking of taking points like that on board, he should consider his regulations as a whole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a useful debate. It started in a small way and suddenly opened into wider considerations. I finish this debate more concerned about what the amendment raises. I do not say that just because the Minister has generously agreed to consider this although that is an assurance which I certainly accept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two broad areas of importance which my hon. Friend should consider. First there is the exercise of the functions of the board. The hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg) put his finger on this when he spoke of staff, particularly in larger schools, who have direct responsibilities in relation to the exercise of some of the functions, such as the use of the premises. A big school may have an administrator
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0913">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>291</span>
as well as a head teacher. Although the job of the administrator is wholly administrative that person has a direct relationship with the functions of these boards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Boards will in any event—this is a point against myself to some extent—look to these administrators perhaps to provide the clerical assistance and perhaps even be the clerk to the board. They are important people and, as the right honourable Gentleman says, the provision as it stands overlooks them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to look at two matters. First, he should consider the functions of the boards and analyse to which people in the school those functions will be directed, particularly where those individuals have responsibilities. It is only right for them to have a role on the school boards, other than a reactive one, if the exercise of their tasks is to be touched upon in any substantial way. If they are only peripheral I do not think that it matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point that my hon. Friend should consider concerns the definition of "teaching" in relation to those involved in education. Again, my vision widened as the debate continued. Those who are involved in education may be part of a much wider group than was first thought. If my hon. Friend is prepared to look at this, without commitment, to see whether there is a better way, bearing those two broad areas in mind, I would be willing to withdraw the amendment. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Knox, for permitting a debate on whether the clause should stand part of the Bill. We have had a long debate on the clause and have explored its provisions in some detail. We shall come back to it on Report because my colleagues and I wish to give more thought to a number of matters which were the subject of amendments that we did not press. We have had a useful debate, but certain matters still cause me considerable concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, we have been unable to establish in the Minister's mind that the school boards should consist of people working together in an atmosphere of consensus for the promotion of those things for which they will be responsible within the school community. The view still remains that the boards should include a majority of parents, and that that is sacrosanct and must not be attacked. I do not like that at all. We should be looking for a way to bring together parents, teachers and the wider school community to work for the school and the good of the children. We have not established that argument and we shall need to return to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue has been aggravated by the regulations on membership of school boards that have been published by the Minister. My hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) has drawn attention to a
	<span class='label label-info column'>292</span>
serious deficiency in these arrangements. Most of the secondary schools with which we are associated have upwards of 800 pupils—probably less than 1,000—and only one staff member will serve on the boards whereas there will be five parent and three co-opted members, making a total of nine. That is not a good formula.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am ever optimistic about the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth), the Minister—I stand alone in that—and I remain optimistic that I can persuade him occasionally to take a different view. I hope that he will reconsider the regulations on membership of school boards because Opposition Members are unhappy with them as they stand. The teachers' organisations are also unhappy, not least the Educational Institute of Scotland which has rightly expressed itself strongly on this matter. The role of the teacher is being played down. That is in nobody's interest, certainly not in pupils' interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am unhappy about co-opted members, and co-opted members will outnumber staff members on a school board in every instance. A school of one to 500 pupils will have one staff member and two co-opted members. A school of 500 to 1,000 pupils will have one staff member and three co-opted members, and a school of 1,000 to 1,500 will have two staff members and three co-opted members. Only in a school of over 1,500 pupils will there be an equal number of staff and co-opted members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case for co-option has not been well stated by the Government. I realise what they want to do and that they foresee difficulties in making arrangements to have the type of people that they want elected on to school boards. I am unhappy about co-opted membership because it perpetuates an inequality. There is co-option in the management in education but not in the management of any other local authority function.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Representatives of the Automobile Association are not co-opted on to the committee dealing with the engineers' department. Those with an interest in environmental health are not co-opted on to the environmental health committee, nor do those from tenants' associations serve as co-opted members on housing committees. Somehow we have grown up with an education system that has allowed for co-option. That is partly a result of the religious background to education, particularly in Scotland where the Church, particularly the free Church, was the original provider of universal education in Scotland. The right honourable Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith referred to that this morning. We have said that we must recognise that interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Likewise, we have said that because denominational schools such as Roman Catholic schools opted in—as it was described by Bishop Devine in 	<i>The Times Educational Supplement (Scotland)</i> last week—we have properly made arrangements for their continuing interests to be represented by co-opted members. However, perhaps co-option in the manner envisaged is not appropriate at the level of the school board. We shall wish to consider that further and to bring forward amendments on Report to explore the Government's ideas on co-option.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0914">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>293</span>
I am surprised that arrangements to choose representatives of particular groups have been left vague. It is clear that with a denominational school they will be chosen,
	<br><blockquote><p>"by the church or denominational body".</p></blockquote>
I am certain that that means that the denominational school will draw its nominees from the local structure of the Roman Catholic Church and that the hierarchy will make its nominations known. I understand the reasons for that and believe that it is correct, but the arrangements for non-denominational schools are much more vague. I cannot say that I was much wiser than I was before the start of the debate this morning. Perhaps I shall know more about it when I have read today's proceedings in 	<i>Hansard.</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have also had difficulties with the question of the mutually exclusive groups. The Minister has been reluctant to allow any erosion of these simple—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Will the hon. Gentlemen who are having a conference please sit down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Dearie me, Mr. Knox, I shall have a word with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On this occasion our Minister seems to be a man of simple principles. He has a clear view of the world, which he sees as square or flat. He is rather like the Prime Minister in that, and is bound to do well under the present Administration. I believe that he will shortly succeed the Secretary of State for Scotland, the right honourable Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind), and will brush aside the Minister of State, Scottish Office, the hon. Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale (Mr. Lang). The procedure is rather like Ronald Reagan's stargazing. However, I shall quickly return to the point. The Minister has a simple view of the world, of economics and of what parents and teachers want. He has arrived at mutually exclusive categories for membership of a school board and he is frightened that his house of cards will fall apart if he alters one of the criteria applying to those mutually exclusive groups. I hope that he will be a little more courageous and that he will consider the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should take into account the grey areas that we discussed today, not least because the definition of "staff" is too tightly drawn. That was pointed out in the previous debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept entirely the Minister's point about smaller schools, and I am sure that the right honourable Member for Kincardine and Deeside also accepts it. There are small schools in villages in my constituency. It is difficult to envisage a part-time secretary and a janitor being the only other staff of a school, apart from kitchen staff. It is not easy to make provision for their representation. In the case of secondary schools, however, the definition of "staff" in the Bill is not good enough, if I may put it so bluntly. It does not hold up in relation to the regulations that the Minister published and which I discussed earlier. It is not the best formula, it will not work and it will cause difficulties. It is not
	<span class='label label-info column'>294</span>
conducive to the atmosphere in which I want school boards to operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we shall succeed in changing the Bill, because I want it to work. I do not want an atmosphere of confrontation. We had a great argument last summer about the ceiling and floor powers. That led to substantial changes in the document produced by the Minister, which has been translated into the Bill. We do not want further argument. We want the Bill to work. To achieve that, I hope that the Minister will consider the valid points that we have made, especially on clause 2, and those that we shall advance in relation to other clauses. As we have not sustained our arguments on clause 2 to the extent that the Minister accepts some of them, we shall vote against the clause this afternoon, but we shall return to these matters on Report. I hope that the House will prevail upon the Minister where the wiser counsel has not prevailed in Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised that the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg) intends to vote against the clause. I assume that he is so worried that he might win the vote and lose the clause that he has given advance notice so that my hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean) has time to ensure that the Opposition are not successful. I cannot believe that the hon. Gentleman would like the clause to be erased from the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will respond cautiously to the hon. Gentleman's attempts to persuade him on the matter of co-option. I understand the fundamental concerns about co-option. It is often cleaner and better for everyone to be elected. My hon. Friend, in particular, will understand what I said about religious interests being represented on the school board. If co-options do not exist, that opportunity—which I believe is right—will be eliminated for those with such interests. Bearing in mind the amendment which I withdrew earlier today, I should be worried if my hon. Friend gave way on that aspect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from the opportunity of those with religious interests to serve on the board, it is important for people in the wider community—especially in relation to rural schools—to have the chance to be represented or to serve on the board. Clearly, parents can be said to be representative of the community because they will be parents of children from the area served by the school. But that does not necessarily apply to teachers. They tend to travel more than in the old days when, especially in rural areas, teachers were always resident near the school. Teacher representatives will not necessarily represent the wider community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Co-option would enable wider representation from the community, which can only be good. For a school to be good, it should be part of, and involved in, the community. Indeed, the reports of Her Majesty's Inspectors of Schools often contain a section which is devoted to the role which a school plays in the community—a role which should be given every facility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to my main argument—and shall do so again. I shall be brief, Mr. Knox, because, as usual, you have been extremely generous in giving Committee members plenty of opportunity to debate the issues.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0915">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>295</span>
However, I beg my hon. Friend the Minister to examine the composition and membership of school boards. I am not wholly convinced about the correctness of the parental majority. My worries are increased by the fact that the school boards are small and that in schools up to a certain size—as the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth made clear—staff membership could be as low as one. That cannot be right. It will not result in the proper involvement of all interested parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept wholeheartedly that the boards should not be too big and unwieldy. Equally, it does not require a great increase in the numbers on the board to give staff better representation. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will reconsider the matter and ensure that there is better staff representation than is allowed for in the consultation document on the membership of school boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I might well return to the matter at a later stage—in a critical way. I also speak for my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir Hugo Munro)—two of us feel strongly about it. Our influence may not be as great on the Floor of the House as in Committee. None the less, no doubt other right honourable and hon. Members will share our interest on the Floor of the House. But I am sure that my hon. Friend is not so insensitive that he would not wish my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries and I to be happy about the issue. I look forward to a constructive review of the boards' membership, although it might not meet all my arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not—and probably will not be—wholly persuaded about parental majority. But my stance might be modified if there were better teacher representation on the boards. If there were such a provision, my hon. Friend the Minister might encourage my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries and I to be more on his side than we are now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of the assurances that I hope that my hon. Friend will repeat I shall not vote against the clause, which lies close to the heart of the Bill and which I hope my hon. Friend will improve between now and Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was watching the Minister carefully while the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) was speaking. He was paying close attention to the somewhat veiled suggestion that the hon. Members for Kincardine and Deeside and for Dumfries (Sir Hugo Monro) would join the Opposition. The Minister does not like guns being pointed at his head, but that seemed to be precisely what was happening. I am sure that I speak for all Opposition Members when I say that we will play our part with great delight in pointing the gun directly at the Minister's head.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I, too, will vote against the clause, not because I oppose parents being elected to school boards but because the clause, as it stands, is wrong. The Minister has got neither the size nor the composition of the school boards correct. For example, all the schools in Dundee, with probably only one exception, would fall
	<span class='label label-info column'>296</span>
into the category of having between 501 and 1,000 pupils, so almost every school in the city would have only one teacher representative on the new school boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is enthusiastic about business interests being represented. A board could contain three representatives co-opted from the business community and only one teacher or staff representative. Such a composition would be deplorable. I hope that the Minister considers carefully revising the size of boards and increasing the representation available to staff, especially to teaching staff. In effect, teachers will be squeezed out of having influence on school boards, which I am sure that the Minister did not intend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg) said, it is important to try to keep politics out of schools. I refer to party politics, not to the teaching of politics. I am all in favour of people being taught in schools how a democratic system works and about party politics. However, party politics should not enter into the running of a school or into the way in which education is provided there, and there is a danger that that will happen under the new school boards that the Minister intends to introduce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal briefly with the concept of parental majority. Both sides of the Committee have used all kinds of words—consensus, harmony and partnership—to describe the relationship between parents and teachers. That is what we are all trying to achieve, but surely by insisting on keeping the parental majority the Minister is undermining the prospect of achieving harmony between parents and other interested groups in education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument has been made again and again, and arises not only in the Minister's consultative process. Tayside regional council asked all school councils in its area to respond to the Minister's proposals. Almost overwhelmingly school councils voiced concern. For example, Blairgowrie school council in the constituency of the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) said specifically that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Partnership cannot be achieved if one group holds the majority."</p></blockquote>
I am sure that when the hon. Member for Tayside, North enters the debate he will support Blairgowrie school council add his influence and say that if we want harmony, partnership and consensus no one group should have a majority on a school council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So that the hon. Gentleman is in no doubt, I must tell him that I recently met representatives of Blairgowrie parents. First, Blairgowrie parents are keen that we should establish boards. Secondly, as recently as two weeks ago they were equally keen that they should have a majority on the board. The report that the hon. Gentleman has received does not necessarily reflect the views of people who want to see the boards formed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was reflecting the views of Blairgowrie school council in its response to Tayside regional council. According to the hon. Member for Tayside, North, Blairgowrie school council is out of step with the views of parents. The report from
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0916">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>297</span>
Blairgowrie school council made what I thought was a very simple point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As well as creating the potential for conflict between the parent majority and other groups within education that will be represented on the school board, the provision invites disharmony. It downgrades the roles played by other groups in education—the head teacher, the staff, other education professionals and other forces in the community. The Minister's attitude has all the echoes of the Secretary of State's phrase about the Gatling gun with which he intended to sort out Scottish Members of Parliament. The Minister has tried to create in the school board system a Gatling gun for the parents so that they can shoot down any opposition to whatever view they are pushing. The views of the school board will not necessarily be those of all parents but may be those of one small group. At the most there will be only seven parents on a school board. They could be elected on a small turnout and not be representative of the views of most other parents. We must be careful about our definitions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The co-option powers worry me, too. In responding to Tayside region's consultative process Dundee presbytery referred specifically to the dangers of school boards misusing the powers of co-option. It said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is always a danger that the use of the co-option powers … might result in unrepresentative cliques or factions controlling a school board."</p></blockquote>
Dundee presbytery recognised that as the Bill stands, once the parental majority is created, it can use its position to invite onto the board whomsoever those parents like—their friends and associates, for example—so that an unrepresentative clique could be in complete control of the board. There could be only one other staff representative apart from the head teacher, and the head teacher would not have a vote. The Minister will have to deal with that possibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one has yet suggested that any guidance should be issued to school boards to advise them, on how to use their powers of co-option. There is endless potential for causing resentment. The right honourable Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) mentioned two groups whose representatives he thought should legitimately be co-opted on to baords—religious interests and the community at large. The Scottish press reports that the Minister is keen that business interests, too, should be co-opted. There are organisations of the elderly, community groups that use the schools and ethnic minority groups, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That latter idea raises the serious problem of racism in Scottish schools. What steps would the Minister take to ensure that if a significant proportion of the pupils in a school were of ethnic minority origin that group would be properly represented on the school board? There seems to be no mechanism to ensure that. We must deal with the question. An education authority, for example, could introduce a policy of anti-racist education in schools, and an all-white school board with no ethnic minority representation could decide how the policy should be applied in the local school, even though the subject was close to the ethnic
	<span class='label label-info column'>298</span>
minority's interests and hearts. How would the Minister deal with that prospect? Will he allow school boards to be unrepresentative, with whole groups excluded from representation? Will he leave it all to the chance of the ballot box so that the majority community will probably vote for its own kind, as people usually do, and the minorities will be excluded? I believe that the Minister has got those arrangements wrong. He has not yet tackled the questions involved, and it is time that he did so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other major problem is the role of the head teacher. The Minister has refused to give head teachers the status of being full members of the boards. The Dundee presbytery complained about that prospect. It said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is no case for teachers having a vote and the headteacher being denied one. The anomalies created could make the headteacher's position invidious. If 'ceiling' powers were applied could teachers vote for the 'rejection' of the headteacher and any other teachers employed in a school?"</p></blockquote>
Could they vote to reject policies for which the head teacher was responsible? I know that the Minister will reply that we are dealing only with the consultative powers of school boards. However, there is legislative potential for the boards to take on almost full ceiling powers. There is also speculation today in the Scottish press that the Minister will use the occasion of the Tory party conference in Scotland tomorrow to announce a bold new initiative on education, such as opting out. I know that the hon. Member for Tayside, North is sponsoring such a resolution at the conference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>[Interruption.]</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman does not go any further down that road because his remark was irrelevant. There was an amendment about opting out but we are now discussing whether the clause should stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I realise, Mr. Knox, that there may be sensitive feelings on the Conservative Benches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are important issues. The head teacher could be in a position in which the school board has taken over much of the running of the school and he is excluded from voting. There will be the potential in future for the school board to opt out of the control of the local education authority notwithstanding the views of the head teacher, who will have no right to vote decisively on whether that should be done. This is a serious flaw in clause 2 and a good reason for our not letting it through as drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important for everyone to know of the interest that a head teacher has in the standards of discipline and rules of a school. Later clauses provide that school boards will be able to take over responsibility for school discipline and rules from the local education authority. Yet the head teacher is to be responsible for ensuring that discipline and rules are upheld while having no influence on them. That is infinitely regrettable. I hope that the Minister will comment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Minister's right honourable Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Science has shown great concern. He is quoted in the press today
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0917">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>299</span>
as saying that teachers should demand tougher discipline in schools because reports have shown that there is an increase in indiscipline and attacks on teachers in England and Wales. I do not know the position in Scotland. I am sure that the Minister is concerned about these problems and appreciates the importance of tackling them. His right honourable Friend thinks that parents should play a much greater role in maintaining discipline in schools. He has suggested that they teach their children that it is wrong to bully people, to hit them and to use force, and that if their children step out of line they should act immediately. I do not know what action they should take: perhaps parents should be told to bully and use force against their children. That is a matter for the conscience of the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must consider the problems for a head teacher of subjecting him to control by a school board if his relationship is to be inferior to that of other board members. The hon. Gentleman must consider this matter seriously and take steps to restore the position and authority of the head teacher in his school. He must do something also about the size and composition of school boards, which cannot be said to reflect the genuine community interest of schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having pressed and supported a battery of amendments that sought to improve the clause, none of which the Minister accepted, it is hardly surprising that I do not feel that the clause should remain part of the Bill. Specific concerns remain. Although the Minister has not accepted amendments, I hope that he will recognise that our concerns are genuine and not party political and that we are probing the operation of the clause. The Minister has answered some questions but left many others unresolved, and may even have stirred up others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the very beginning the Minister let the genie out of the bottle and, as everyone knows, when the genie is out of the bottle he cannot be crammed back in it. I am sure that the right honourable Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) will not object if I say that he claims considerable credit—I do not quarrel with that—for pressing the Minister to modify his original proposals, and that the present proposals are something of an improvement on the original powers. But everyone knows what the Minister wants, and everyone has a feeling that once the Bill is enacted he will try to get the powers that he wished for the boards. Thus the concern that has been expressed by both Government and Opposition Members will remain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why I believe that the crucial issue in the clause is the parental majority. It is interesting that parents have said throughout the consultation process that they do not want to have a majority. It appears that they want a partnership, and there is a substantial parental majority over other groups because the parents' majority will determine the co-options. It means that in many schools the parents' representatives will be against one teacher trying to argue the education cause. Parents themselves have said that they do not
	<span class='label label-info column'>300</span>
want that. In a genuine debate—the Minister may argue that the head teacher is there without a vote, but is attending—parents may legitimately wish to have a second view of education priorities from a different teacher.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman aware of another factor that had some influence on me—that the Scottish Parent-Teacher Council has consistently supported the principle of parent majority? That should be borne in mind, for the sake of the record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that. Parent representatives—certainly individual parents—have expressed that view to me. Much depends on what the boards will be doing in the longer term and not merely the short term. If we are talking about super-school councils, I have long argued that people are not attracted by school councils because they have no power once they are elected and they get frustrated when they cannot get things done. I have always argued that school councils should have more power and a right to ensure that decisions are taken. But what should be the extent of their power? The main cause of concern is the extension of that power into interfering with the curriculum, discipline and the appointment of teachers, which we know the Minister wants, even though it is not what the Bill says.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must not say that I want things.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It remains a fact that the issue of parental majority raises considerable reservations and questions to which I am sure the Committee will wish to return later. For the moment, however, I shall leave the matter, and simply say that I, for one, shall wish to return to it later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am disappointed that it has not been possible to extend the role of pupils on school boards, I shall not reiterate the arguments, but it would be a beneficial development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested in the debate about the teaching auxiliaries, the role of other staff members and the commitment that they could make. I accept immediately that they do not have to be members of the board to make a useful contribution. But, in passing, I suggest that janitors often have a crucial role in the finances and good running of the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0918">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>301</span>
I cite an example of Torphins a few years ago when my son was a pupil at the village school. The regional council cut the number of janitors because of Government pressure. Instead of one janitor serving one school, he served several schools. During a severe winter, it was decided that the heating would be turned off over the weekend. Previously, the janitor was responsible for checking the school during the weekend but he was no longer available. Consequently, the school pipes froze and no education could be given to the children for a week. When the thaw came, it was discovered that the roof had been so severely damaged that it cost £85,000 to repair. That shows that the contribution and advice of janitors should be fully considered. I hope that that remark has prevented you from rising yet again, Mr. Knox.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing an important clause that sets the framework and tone within which the boards will operate. We believe that it is appropriate for the Committee and, indeed, the House to re-examine how those boards will be structured.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know the Government's majority and accept that the Bill will be enacted, so there will be school boards. However, I am anxious to ensure that they work as effectively as possible and that the worries of parents and teachers are fully considered. They are worried about the structure of school boards because they believe that they could operate so that far from creating a sensible partnership in which parents support teachers in the good running of the school, some parents could divide the school and provoke conflict with the teachers. They would not necessarily represent the wishes of all parents. It is unfortunate that the Minister has not felt able to allow parent members to be accepted or allow them to decide whom they wish to represent their interests on the board. That would seem to me to be the right place to allow power to reside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many matters to which the Committee will wish to return. We should have to return to those if the clause were deleted from the Bill. The Minister will have to use his imagination to take the Committee's mood away. I am every hopeful, but I should be surprised if that were achieved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall, of course, stick to the point, as the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) has done. As usual, the Opposition have won the debate hands down. We can tell that by the glazed look on the faces of those on the Government Front Bench. That may be caused by the quantity of material that they must wade through while sitting through this purgatory.

I am very surprised at the lack of contributions from the hon. Members for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) and for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart). They are not usually known for their reticence. [Hon. Members: "He is writing a speech."] I must not interrupt that as it should make very interesting reading in the Scottish press. Even the Government Whip has shown some interest in the debate, unlike last week when he appeared to be reading something called, "Welcome to the Conservative Party". It had a picture of a bulldog on the front, which is singularly inappropriate for a Scottish
	<span class='label label-info column'>302</span>
Standing Committee. I do not know whether it had teeth, but I noted today that he was reading something about apricots. Perhaps he was thinking about a novel diet to take his mind off the difficulties that the Government have in persuading us to accept the clause. I am sure that you appreciate that reference, Mr. Knox. Bulldogs are short-lived, thick and fat. It sounds like an apt description.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend should be commended for speaking indirectly about the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am always fairly tolerant, but I am finding it difficult to relate what the hon. Gentleman says to the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: After that brief preamble, I shall concentrate on the main issue. I am disappointed that the Minister has not been a little more generous in his acceptance of the reasonable points made by the Opposition. I take issue on parents being in the majority on the board. I shall not rehearse the arguments again as the matter has been discussed extensively. There are very good reasons why one group should have a majority on a school board and we shall pay in future for the Minister's intransigence on the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister failed to acknowledge that teachers whose children are at school will be disfranchised from serving on the school board. That is a serious flaw in the Bill and it is unfair, undemocratic and unwise. There is no reason why such teachers should be excluded from being members of the board. The Minister's arguments have failed to convince us and he should think again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The vaguest portion of this unfortunate clause is that dealing with co-option. The Minister has conveniently said that it will be left to regulation. I suspect that he has no idea who should be co-opted. I am utterly opposed to religious interests being co-opted on to the boards of nondenominational schools. As a parent who has no interest in any religious faith, I strongly object to one of the limited number of co-opted members being a member of the Church. I do not see why my children, attending a non-denominational school, should be subjected to that type of influence. It may be appropriate for a denominational school when parents choose to have their children educated in the Christian faith. That is not my choice. I do not see why that influence should be inflicted on a school, especially when someone far more appropriate is better able to represent the views of a community than a minister of any church, particularly since fewer than 10 per cent of Scottish people attend any religious institutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister suggested other groups who could be involved. He suggested chambers of commerce. The only contribution that my local chamber of commerce has made towards education is to complain about the high rates which are largely taken up by education services. I cannot remember any more trenchant contribution to the debate on education in Fife from any other body. The Minister is in difficulties. In another two or three months, he will have had the chance to reflect and will suggest groups that should be represented on the boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0919">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>303</span>
I shall conclude on a more optimistic note. The Minister has taken on board much of what we have said about other school staff and the desirability of their being staff representatives on school boards. I accept in good faith that the Minister will consider that issue again. But that does not redress the balance on what I consider to be a most inadequate clause. I shall vote against it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be non-controversial and remain in order. That may be of some disappointment to my hon. Friends, but that is the way that I shall proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our debate has illustrated that the Minister is correct in saying that the Bill contains a revolutionary rather than an evolutionary concept in taking parental involvement forward. Clause 2 starts the process of delineating the organisation and composition of membership of school boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because there is a consensus in all sections of education in Scotland parental involvement should move forward. But there is a distinction between that and the question of parent majority. The consultations by the Government show clearly that parents do not want to be too closely involved in an executive or management role. The Minister may say that they will not initially have that opportunity. But the embodiment of that major jump—from the concept of involvement to one of majority—will, as my hon. Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy (Dr. Moonie) said, create major difficulties, especially in the early stages. I have huge reservations about the parent majority element of the school boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I might not endear myself to the Scottish Parent-Teacher Council, which is a worthy body and fulfils an excellent role in Scottish education, but judgment may be lacking in its wholehearted support for the proposals. I quote from the first paragraph of a letter sent to me by Mr. Brodie enclosing an article that he hopes will appear in some of the Scottish newspapers. I have not sought approval for quoting Mr. Brodie, but I am sure that the orders of the House will cover that impertinence. Mr. Brodie said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Eight short months after the publication of the Government's Consultation Paper 'School Management and the Role of Parents' there is now widespread agreement that more parental involvement is needed in Scottish schools and general acceptance that a School Board for every school will help achieve this. Even the controversy which erupted after the leak over 'opting out' has receded following assurances that no such legislation will be introduced during this parliamentary session."</p></blockquote>
The Parliamentary Under-Secretary may have given those assurances privately, but he did not make them to the Committee when asked last week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second area that causes anxiety, which emanates from the organisational structure and composition, is the rather confused notion of teaching and non-teaching staff. I will settle for the Minister's assurance that he will look at that. But it was a rather grudging assurance and I sincerely hope that the Minister and his Scottish Office advisers will see that with existing practice in Scotland with school and college councils it
	<span class='label label-info column'>304</span>
would not be a step back in their revolutionary fervour to simply accept the goodwill of the many who contribute to education who should be taken seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When developing some of the implications of clause 2 in its entirety, the third cause for concern is the size of the membership of the school boards. I accept that the Minister will support the clause, but he should further reflect on the question of the 1 to 500 and 500 to 1,000 pupil schools. It is nonsense—I use the word advisedly—to have one staff member for each board which, in the light of previous discussions today, could be subdivided in a debate about whether teaching or non-teaching staff should represent the school. Clearly, the school boards may be too small and a parental majority would distort their function and role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fourth point that I wish to stress is the mistrust that has been generated by the Bill in relation to the composition of school boards. The right honourable Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) raised the question of the role of the head teacher and the composition of the board in relation to consultative powers. To consider the Bill in relation to consultative powers is only one part of the argument. The Minister has led us to believe that the Bill is a prelude to the assumption of more executive powers and to a subject about which the Government do not like to speak—opt out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If some of the mistrust had been removed from the debate by firm assurances from the Government on many aspects, we may have had more sympathy with the establishment of the consultative role. We may also have accepted more fully the type of composition in relation to non-teaching staff and head teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, my hon. Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy (Dr. Moonie) made the point about any one group having a majority. In view of the newness of the concept, and accepting that we must move towards parental involvement, is it necessary to build in a potential for confrontation, which will not help, but could damage the work of school boards? The Minister has assured us that there is unlikely to be any need for votes. I do not share his doubts about political parties becoming involved. Whether an area is blue or red—I am unaware of the colour of the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce)—[Hon. Members: "Gold."]—Whether an area is blue, red or gold, there is a risk of political involvement. It must be assumed from the start that a built-in parental majority will give parents the power and, as a consequence, encourage irresponsibility and a political dimension with a small "p" in the local debate. That will be unhelpful for the future of Scottish education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For all those reasons, I shall vote against the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) said, the clause is important and sets the tone of the Bill. The Opposition take exception to several points—for example, the fact that parents of pre-school children and primary 7 pupils who are going to secondary school will be disenfranchised by the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, we oppose the regulations for the detailed composition of the school boards. I have discussed that several times today. The Minister must take the subject seriously. A small number of parents will represent the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0920">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>305</span>
majority and there will be only a token staff representation. We feel that the parental representation should not exceed the combined representation of other groups. The Bill is against Scottish traditions and the clearly expressed wishes of parents during the consultation process. My constituents have emphasised time and again, in writing and orally, that there should be a partnership between parents, teachers, elected members and the wider community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith)—
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<i>[Interruption.]</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right honourable Member—who is nearly a friend—talked of the HMI reports. I received a good HMI report from a school in my constituency last week which stressed the cooperation of the staff in the school, stressed the community involvement in the school, and pinpointed the role and personality of the head teacher. The head teacher was going out into the wider community, giving the thrust to the movement toward cooperation. We want head teachers to be eligible for full board membership for those reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 2(4) deals with teachers who are parents of children at a school. Why should not those individuals be involved? The Minister talks about choice. Individuals should be able to choose whether they stand as staff members or as parent members. The Bill does not permit such choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reasons given in the Bill for co-opted members are vague. There is insufficient explanation and the Minister should give the reasons for introducing those members. They would have more credibility if they were referred to as community members, reflecting their representation of the wider community. Sadly, the community dimension is missing from the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has not answered the questions of the eligibility of co-opted members, or the method of their election. Hon. Members spoke earlier about boards not taking executive decisions until the co-opted members are elected. That is important. We surely cannot have executive decisions, which would set down the policy of boards for five or six months, without having full representation. Will the Minister look seriously at that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned the local education authority, parents and community groups. But how will the interests of district authorities, which have cooperated with regional authorities in the provision of leisure and recreational facilities for example, be represented on school boards? How will the interests of the members of the community, who use the educational and recreational facilities of a school, be served? In my own area the district council is involved in schools. There are no statutory provisions, but there is cooperation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware of the interesting development in the Glenwood area of my constituency, which was the seat of councillor Douglas Mason until a mishap befell him at the polls last Thursday evening? In that area they have a unique concept of what they call a community use primary
	<span class='label label-info column'>306</span>
school, which is 25 per cent supported by the district council and 75 per cent supported by the education authority. With his superior knowledge of education, can my hon. Friend tell me how the school board will cope with that, as it will comprise only staff and parents from the school? Will the district council be excluded completely, even though it makes a 25 per cent contribution to finances and participates in the running of the school?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely and that reinforces my point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer again to my own area where there is a secondary school and an urban aid project that serves the community. As I have mentioned before, I was involved in that project. One facility—the library—was run by the Manpower Services Commission, which was very good and kept it going well beyond the three-year period—in fact, for six or seven years. But there was a limit to how long it could keep the facility going.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By dint of endeavour and, perhaps, arm-twisting—I would not say force—we were lucky enough to have the district council take over the library facilities, notwithstanding its cash problems. That library has a common function and is not only for individuals to go to to take out books. Senior pupils from two secondary schools adjacent to it go across to the building for community involvement and they mix with adults and children there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Is the hon. Gentleman about to explain how this is related to the composition of boards?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware of your tolerance, Mr. Knox, and I do not want to stretch it. My point is that the district authority had a role and an interest in the school and the wider community and there is no recognition of the district authority in this measure. The Minister should understand the role that district councils play while they do not have any statutory responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I reiterate that we are much against there being a majority of parent members because of the partnership angle. The composition of the school boards should represent the common interest in the work of the school. That work is shared by the local authority, the community, the parents, the staff and the pupils, and the composition of the board should reflect that wider interest. Therefore, the parent groups should not exceed any other combined groups. It is only by partnership and involvement that we shall progress in education. If this measure goes through, progress in education will be retarded. As I mentioned at the beginning of my speech, it is so fundamental to the progress of education in Scotland that we feel that it is worth having a stand-part debate and voting against the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A number of points have been raised and they have been covered in our discussions. However, I shall try to reassure members of the Committee who are still worried about the purpose of the clause.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0921">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>307</span>
On the issue of parent members and majority. Opposition Members make a mistake if they consider the parental majority merely in the context of the school board. The school board is a forum for parents, who have been excluded from the education system for far too long. Teachers have their own opportunities to make their views known about what is going on in the school. There will be staff meetings, informal contacts in the staff room and a host of meetings. There may be members' boards of studies and so on. Parents have no such forum. Far from arguing, as Opposition Members have, that a balance of parent and teacher members on the school boards would provide for greater partnership, I argue the reverse. It would seek to establish a "them and us" framework within the boards. The boards are there for the parents, and the teachers' representatives and the co-opted representatives are included to provide a balance of experience and expertise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been asked by several members of the Committee about the co-options and why they are necessary. We provide for co-options so that the range of experience that is available in any community can be added to that of the parents. The hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) asked how the parents are to know whom they should co-opt and where the guidance will come from. That is a matter for the boards. The local authorities could provide them with lists of suitable organisations which they might trawl, but they should look around them and consider what expertise is available to them, what representation there is and what might be appropriate for further consideration. Opposition Members cannot have it both ways. They cannot argue, as they have done, that there should be no provision for co-option if the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) then jumps up and asks about provision for ethnic minorities, or my right honourable Friend asks about provision for janitors or other groups which are not included. Janitors could be co-opted if they were not eligible for election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Co-option provides an important opportunity to bring in other groups which are unable to put themselves forward for election. It also provides an opportunity for church representation, as our earlier debate showed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Kirkcaldy (Dr. Moonie) startled the Committee by saying that he would not like to see a churchman co-opted to any school to which his children went. I cannot resist the temptation to ask the hon. Gentleman whether he is therefore against clergymen being on education authority committees as of right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, it is the right place for them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If not, there seems to be a curious distortion in the hon. Gentleman's thinking. However, I take strength from the hon. Gentleman's position. By leaving it to school boards, we allow them to take account of what are probably minority views, but views should, nevertheless, be considered. There are no provisions in the clause which would prevent that kind of flexibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>308</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: An education committee is larger and there can be a reasonable representation of religious beliefs as a proportion of the numbers involved.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am happy to repeat my undertakings about considering the definitions relating to non-teaching staff. But I do not want to mislead the Committee. I made it clear that I was not inclined to create an opportunity for all staff in the school to be eligible for election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right honourable Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) is anxious about the teacher membership and is not very happy with the draft suggestions for regulations on membership of school boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise the view that staff representation, in schools where there are more than 500 pupils, is not adequate, and I am happy to undertake to think about that without making any commitment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And up to 500?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not certain whether my right honourable Friend's question refers to increasing the overall size of the boards. I was talking about the proposed teacher representation within the structure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right honourable Friend raises the important point of the overall size of the board. I am afraid that some members of the Committee have tried to have it both ways on this point. My right honourable Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside has not done that, nor has my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries. But Opposition Members have done so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg) says "Agh". He should recall the speech that he made in one of our earlier sittings in which he said that the system would not work because not enough parents would come forward. He asked where we would find all the parents. Yet as we have proceeded in our deliberations he has argued for larger boards with more parents, whom he argued previously we would not be able to find. If the hon. Gentleman accepts the parental majority—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We do not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee having taken a view on that, the hon. Member went on to argue from that position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's familiarity with the red herring suggests that he must be from Dundee. This is a red herring. Surely the Minister can accept that there is one argument about whether school boards are practicable in terms of numbers and a completely different one about what is a suitable number of people to make a school board function. These are separate arguments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, but, I have tried already to explain to the Committee why we believe that there should be a parental majority. If we increase the number of co-opted members or community members as Opposition Members would like, and increase the number of teachers, more parents are required. Opposition Members have argued that we would have difficulty in finding the necessary parents as it is. I simply point to their attempts to have it both ways.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are separate issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The final issue to be raised was the role of the head teacher. It is quite remarkable, in view of our debates, that Opposition Members have not been prepared to accept the views of the head teachers themselves, who are content with the provisions in the clause. I can say that with some authority. The hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth quoted from a newspaper earlier, but I spoke to both primary heads and secondary heads on Saturday. I had a good reception and they were extremely content. They looked forward to the Bill's provisions. They had some niggles about one or two minor points of detail but they were content with the overall position of not having a vote and the composition of the committees. Indeed, the Head Teachers Association of Scotland pressed us hard in the primary schools not to have a large staff membership. That was one of the reasons why the regulations, with which my right honourable Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside is unhappy, are framed in the way they are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are no easy answers to finding a balance here. It is a matter of judgment, and I think that we have the right one. The Committee has explored all the possibilities and I hope will conclude that the Government's proposal is the best compromise to meet all the competing interests which need to be brought together and resolved.

We are saying—I accept, in a negative way—that local authorities should not have to submit plans for each and every school to the Secretary of State for Scotland for approval. The Secretary of State for Scotland should tell the authorities how he would like them to proceed. Instead of having hundreds of letters moving between the schools, the education authorities and the Secretary of State, it would be better if he advised authorities how to proceed.

I hope that we get agreement on our proposal. It should appeal to the Minister because it is more centralist than what is suggested in the Bill, which is a rather complicated way to go about it. The Minister said much about the guidance that he will hand out about one thing or another and we look forward to that. The Secretary of State and the authorities are so acquainted with elections and election procedure that they should want to proceed in a uniform way, as for other elections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the point that will be made later by the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce). He and I have had a good working relationship in this Committee until now and he will surprise us all with his proposals for proportional representation. Precisely what the proportions will be is not clear, but we look forward to what he says on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Authorities should not be allowed to propose widely different schemes. There is a strong case for COSLA and the education authorities giving clear advice on election procedure through the agency of the Scottish Education Department. If it were done that way, it would be simpler and better understood across the country than the system that is proposed in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right to argue that his proposal is centralist. It does not appeal to me because of that. I try to give opportunity for variety, diversity and freedom for local authorities to produce schemes appropriate to their local circumstances.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—if that is the Committee's view, because it would certainly make life much easier in the Scottish Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I am too rash, I shall say something about our thinking. We could have been more prescriptive and looked to regulation, but we thought that there should be scope for local variation. The hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth is anxious about Scottish Office staff being distracted from other more important tasks, such as following up our policy initiatives, so I am happy to give the hon. Gentleman an undertaking to reconsider this proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I like the amendments rather more than I like the speech that the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg) made in support of them. One or two points are right. The Minister said that he was in favour of a degree of diversity and did not wish to be too prescriptive, and I hope that he will not change from that view too sharply. However, several provisions in the schedule give the Secretary of State quite a lot of power—in contrast to what the Minister said—to reject or impose a solution. I hope that the Minister will say that he supports the thrust of the amendments, which is that the Secretary of State
	<span class='label label-info column'>312</span>
should not take that power but, more importantly, if he does, should not seek to use it and should respect the council's power to produce a scheme. He should not generally wish to reject or change it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In seeking to be helpful to the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth, I did dwell on the nature of his amendment. Amendment No. 81 would do more than I suspect he intended, as it would not only remove the requirement to submit a scheme to the Secretary of State for approval, but remove the requirement for an education authority to draw up a scheme at all, which I presume he does not intend. I assume that he is against local authorities having to draw up their own scheme to submit to the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman made an important point when he said that the result could be different schemes in different parts of Scotland, and people not being aware of the electoral system. Thus he suggested that the scheme should be made by the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has raised certain alarm bells in me. I believe that diversity should be allowed. Specifically I was concerned that the schedule says that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may … impose a scheme in such terms as he thinks appropriate".</p></blockquote>
That is regrettable. I cannot see at a glance which amendment removes that, but its thurst is correct. Different education authorities will have different ideas, and these should be permitted. I hope that the Minister will not take too definitive a line. I liked his first comment more than his intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall move the amendments formally—no, I shall withdraw them.

The phrase "or group of schools" relates to circumstances involving a group of schools.

I do not profess to be an authority on these, but I am sure that hon. Gentlemen who represent those areas will point out that a board will not be a practical proposition with some very small schools, which is why I have suggested that they be grouped. To some extent they are probing amendments and I should like to have the Minister's

<br><br><!-- lb -->
In drawing up that guidance, we shall take account of the hon. Gentleman's point, if he meant that it should be possible to have different election schemes for different schools on a geographical basis—perhaps, for example, for a group of secondary schools with feeder primaries.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments involve fundamental principles, because the credibility of school boards is at stake. The ballot should be a secret postal ballot and should not involve children. Pre-paid envelopes should be supplied for the return of ballot papers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that the measure was drawn up by someone with no practical experience in schools. I can speak from experience. When schoolchildren are given information to take home to their parents, their ingenuity is beyond belief. I have given children notes to take to their parents, and they have assured me warmly two or three times that they delivered the note. Finally, whether by design or accident, the parents have had to contact me, or I have sent a registered letter asking the parents to come to the school. In many cases, even when the children were confronted by the parents, they would insist that they had given them the notes, but the parent had gone out to bingo or was busy with something else. The poor parents had to defend themselves and account for what they were doing. If children were involved, it would devalue the exercise, although that is no blanket condemnation of children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>314</span>
The provision of pre-paid envelopes is important. It would ensure the involvement of every parent. At present the clause is an administrative nightmare for any school or its staff. For example, in a school with 1,000 pupils, there might be 20 to 30 teachers who would have to ensure that letters went out to the parents and were returned. That is a recipe for ineffectiveness. If the Government intend to involve every parent, prepaid envelopes must be made available. Senior staff and teachers must devote their time to many other matters. If the exercise is to be carried out by the school, it will not be cost-effective. The energies and commitment of senior staff would be tied up for considerable periods, and that would detract from the main issues of education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I underline the credibility of school boards. If they are established, they must have credence in the eyes of parents and the community. That can be achieved only by involving each and every parent—which means a postal, secret ballot, with pre-paid envelopes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>7.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to speak on this group of amendments. However, my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) might be interested in a story which I heard today. It relates to a child in London who was engaged in a rather serious—though not too serious—misdemeanour in school. It was the kind of matter that would cause a head teacher to send a letter home with the child to the parents, saying that the school could not accept such behaviour and asking them to do something about it. That was done. But, aware that he had been caught out in a rather serious matter, on the way home the little boy threw the letter over a garden hedge in Hampstead. However, he thought better of it—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Mr. Ian Lang)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Where?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is where all good Labour supporters live. However, the little boy thought better of it by the time he reached home and he was worried sick. His mother realised that he was worrying about something and finally the confession emerged about what had happened. The mother had to telepone another child's parent—to whom the letter had been delivered—to find out what it said and to respond to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Very young children often regard an official letter as something to worry about. To trust them with ballot papers is not really on; it is not a good idea.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman aware that gardens in Hampstead are not the only repositories? I am told on good authority, by many mothers, that washing machines on Monday mornings often yield letters from the school, which are equally difficult to read in those circumstances!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that they are. I hope that the Minister will accept that it is not the way to proceed. Children must not be used to deliver ballot papers—there is something suspect about that. It would be full of dangers. We want—and we want parents—to take

	<span class='label label-info column'>315</span>
school boards seriously. We do not enhance the chances of that by saying, in effect, that the matter is so important that the child can be given the letter to take back to the school. We can do better than that. I hope that the Minister will accept that we are seriously trying to improve the Bill by seeking to delete that provision. We want the process to involve a ballot paper as we all understand it; it could go second class mail or it could be delivered to the school by the parents—but not by the children. Children should not be involved in an election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I add a personal plea to the Minister to listen. The issue is not party-political and could probably be resolved almost unanimously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another element. I come from Dundee and have experience of people fighting dirty in elections to any kind of council or committee. There are characters on the fringes of politics—eccentrics—who are destined to get elected on to anything, simply because they want to be an elected member of whatever body. Often, they stoop to tactics in which respectable political parties would not be involved. Such fringe characters might approach children with the intention of getting the ballot papers from them. Therefore, to use children in the delivery of such ballot papers might open them to approaches from strangers who wish illegitimately to get their hands on those papers. No Committee member should even consider involving children in such circumstances. The issue is serious. If the Minister wants a secret ballot, we would support that—but let us do it properly. Children should not be involved in what can sometimes be very dirty business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the intervention by the right honourable Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith), I feel morally obliged to speak. I have had many problems with my daughter, who is 12 years old. She is bright, charming but can be completely disoriented at any particular time in a day. Invariably, when she is asked to bring home a note about a function which is to take place two or three days later, we get sight of the note two or three weeks later, which serves no useful purpose. The serious message is that if, despite our protestations, we are to have the boards, if they are to work in a democracy that takes accountability and balloting seriously, this cannot be the way forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a postscript, paragraph 5 of schedule 1 contains an interesting group of words, which the advisers who are now looking at me may wish to consider, about who will be eligible to receive a ballot paper. Paragraph 5 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"for every parent of a pupil".</p></blockquote>
Does that mean if a pupil has two parents they will both get votes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And if they are living apart?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If two parents have four children, will they have eight votes? I ask the Minister to reflect on that conundrum, which I cannot fathom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>316</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can explain. A pupil could have three parents, each of whom would have a vote. It is the number of parents, not the number of children, that matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) raised the question of the definition of a parent and I explained to the Committee how it was possible to have three parents. It is the parents who hold the votes. The number of children that they have does not determine the number of votes to which each point is entitled, which is one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has clarified the parental aspect of the conundrum, but if I were a parent of two pupils, would I get two ballot papers sent by the two children, as envisaged by the provision?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I understand that it will be for the convenience of Members and suit their social arrangements if we reassemble at 9.30 pm.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The question is whether pupil post is appropriate. The hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg) may not have appreciated exactly what is involved. The issue is whether parents should be allowed to ask their children to return completed ballot papers to the school. The ballot papers will be issued by post. I understand the misgivings expressed by the hon. Gentleman and by the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall), but as the Bill is framed the matter is open for parental choice. I have taken account of what the Opposition have said about the possibilities of abuse, although I am not convinced that it would be right to insist that all ballot papers for all elections should be sent out and returned by post. Clearly that would be a ridiculous condition to impose on elections for teacher members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We intend to hold discussions with the Electoral Reform Society. It may be appropriate if I take account of the concern that has been expressed in Committee and think about it, along with the other matters that the Opposition have given me to think about today. We may consider making some amendments on Report. I was especially struck by what the hon. Member for Dumbarton said about maintaining the credibility of school boards and ensuring that the basis on which elections are held is not open to abuse or ridicule. On that basis I hope that the hon. Member will feel inclined to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of the Minister's constructive comments I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"A Returning Officer shall be appointed to oversee the conduct of elections.".</p></blockquote>
The amendment would insert the requirement to have a returning officer. That title may seem grand and the post unnecessary, but I believe that it is necessary. Someone has to be in charge of an election. There can be no election without someone being designated as the person in charge of it. I should be happy if the director of education were nominated as the returning officer for the whole region, or the divisional education officer for each division in large authorities, but someone must arbitrate. Someone has to decide whether a ballot paper has been spoiled, deal with a tied vote and oversee the rules of the election, whether they come from the Scottish Education Department or from the region. Someone must be able to rule. I want an official of the local authority to be designated as the person in charge of the election for some or all of the schools in the authority's area. I want whatever system is the tidiest and the best. I am not being inflexible. There must be someone in charge of an election. If there is not, it is a recipe for chaos. I hope that the Minister will accept that simple basis for our amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to make this a habit, but I must tell the hon. Gentleman that I have no difficulties over the principle of the amendment. It is hard to conceive of an election being conducted without the presence of a returning officer. We expect an authority's scheme of election to show, as a basic requirement, provisions for the appointment of a returning officer, or returning officers. I am not persuaded that it is necessary to spell this out in primary legislation. I have noted what has been said and I shall reflect upon it and, if necessary, return to it on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to hear that the Minister's reflections will take a long time because we are giving him so much upon which to reflect.

I wished to know—I am struggling Mr. Knox to express this in a point of order—what were the proportions that would be distributed on school boards.

The hon. Member for Gordon has rushed through the door, Mr. Knox. I am pleased that I have been able to keep this discourse going because he has been a most reasonable member of the Committee. In the circumstances, I withdraw my point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows that it was not a point of order in the first place. The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 65, in page 15, line 25, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"A. Elections under this Act will be under a proportional system.".</p></blockquote>
I appreciate the grace and courtesy that have allowed me the opportunity to move the amendment. After rereading it, I am not sure that I expect it to be accepted. I do not wish to impose the solution on an authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following my earlier argument, I ask the Minister to allow local authorities, as the Bill allows them, to make their own recommendations and not to use the powers that the schedule gives him to overthrow suggestions for different solutions in different parts of the country. It is conceivable that as many as five or six education authorities could consider seriously a method of election that is different from the usual, and most frequently used, first-past-the-post system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Committee is used to me and my party advancing this argument, I hope that it will accept that using a proportional system—usually the single transferable vote—is an increasingly recognised method of election, especially to organisations in which individuals stand on their merit rather than on party-political labels. Some of my colleagues in the Labour party may be more aware than of how many trade unions use proportional systems for the election of office bearers. That it is not pure self-interest is clearly borne out by the fact that Arthur Scargill backs it; it must be the only thing on which he and I agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The election of office bearers in trade unions by a system of proportional representation is becoming increasingly prevalent. On numerous occasions, the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) has expressed concern—a concern that I share—about the possibility of school boards becoming party political. I am sure that all members of the Committee share the view that that would be an undesirable and unwelcome development, and I do not believe that any of its members would promote or encourage it. Nevertheless, we could not prevent it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point has been put to me—I am sure that the Minister will be aware of it—that such a development could lead to political cliques, or cliques with other motivations—perhaps not political; simply ones of narrow interest—which would seek to put up a slate of candidates to take control of boards for purposes which are rather more objectionable than simply trying to serve the community—namely, to advance a particular view. It may not be a political view; it may be a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0927">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>319</span>
view that says, "We should stamp out the teaching of science" or "We should invest heavily in computers" or "We should put it all into pianos". Different members of the Committee may have sympathy with different preferences, and it would be an inappropriate distortion of the need to provide educational balance and the widest choice and opportunity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Taking account of the political complexion of Scotland, the Minister will realise that if school boards become party political the chance of their fulfilling the objective that he seeks is slim. Increasingly, the nature of Scottish politics does not favour Right-wing radical Conservativism, although I am sure that the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth)—in that capacity as well as in his capacity as Under-Secretary of State—is anxious to turn the tide and may argue that last Thursday he stemmed it, at least in his constituency. He may feel proud of himself, but he should be concerned about other parts of the country—for example, my constituency, where the Conservative party, in my view, could well benefit from porportional representation. I managed, I think, to secure 20 per cent of the vote, but it secured no seats at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are talking about proportional representation on school boards, not the political complexion of the hon. Gentleman's constituency or the constituency of any other hon. Member.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is quite correct, Mr. Knox, and I stand rebuked. Nevertheless, I think that it is fair to point out that the point of proportionality is to ensure that a board is representative of all shades of opinion. Without that system, it is possible for a slate, whether a political slate or a sectional interest slate, to carry the day in circumstances where it has less than total support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, as a system of voting for individuals, proportionality is now becoming familiar to many people. It is easier to arrange a series of candidates in order of preference, particularly if several candidates are to be elected, than to try to work out how many votes one has and how many Xs one should enter. It is a system with which the people of Northern Ireland—and, indeed, southern Ireland—have become familiar, and I am sure that this Government have put their name to advertisements in Northern Ireland which say "Voting is as simple as 1,2,3".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The only point that I would make is that the system most used in this country is the single transferrable vote, but I accept that there may be alternative systems which local authorities, which are responsible for drawing up the framework for election to school boards, may wish to choose. The only point that I wish to press with the Minister is that

I do not suggest that a proportional system should be imposed throughout Scotland. I should like that, but my main concern is that the education authorities should be able to devise a system and if they recommend a proportional system, the Minister should not use his powers to overthrow it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that he thought that everyone on Committee was anxious not to introduce party politics to school boards. Surely, a system of proportional representation can work only when there are party-political candidates and when seats are allocated on a party-political basis. People stand as individuals and cannot be regarded as proportional representation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point, which brings me back to the single transferrable vote as a system of proportional representation. Depending on the size of the board in which there may be four or five members, the first past the post system could mean that there are five or four parent members, and people will be told that they can give their cross to any five of 20 candidates. Those who get the most crosses will be elected. I argue that it is easier for people to use a system such as the single transferrable vote—it seems to be the most appropriate system but not necessarily the only one—and that that system is used extensively within the trade union movement. In some cases, it is a matter of preference—are they Left, Right, Centre or Militant? Often, it is a matter of people expressing degrees of preference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the wider issue of the elections. Many parents will not know who the candidates are. We have provision for a 150 or 250-word resume of the candidate and his merits. That will obviously be helpful. There could be voter fatigue. The voter will say, "Well, I only know two of those people. I may have five votes, but frankly, I shall just put two crosses and I shall have no say whatever." I would suggest that a system such as STV would encourage people to say, "I know who I want to be elected first and second", but it would encourage them to express some preference. I believe that that would increase the involvement and participation of people who might wish to use their vote more forceably and effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that members of the Committee will say that they have heard that all before, but that system would make considerable sense. It would ensure a higher turnout and higher voter interest. Many local authorities may wish to encourage that system. We seek the Minister's assurance that he would not regard such a proposal as a reason for introducing his own system. For example, Grampian regional council has been described in certain quarters as the best hung council in Britain. It says that it is in favour of the establishment of a Scottish Parliament elected by proportional representation. That view has been supported by all but one of the political parties. I may be wrong. It may have been supported by all political parties. Grampian regional council may decide to recommend a proportional system. So might Highland and other councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I seek the assurance of the Minister that if a council wished to follow that system, he would not throw out
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0928">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>321</span>
the idea, especially as he wants diversity. I hope that the Minister will agree that that is an acceptable course to take and that he will not reject any such proposal. That would be a fair and reasonable response. But that is not what my amendment says, and I am not seeking to press it. It would be more useful to get an assurance from the Minister. If I had that assurance, I would not press my amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not support the amendment as drafted. However, it focuses our attention on an important issue. If three or four members were eligible for election, would the parent have one vote or would the parent have as many votes as there are places on the Committee? That is what happens normally. If there are seven candidates and three places each voter gets three votes. It is incumbent on the Minister to explain his plans for the scheme. I foresee great difficulties if he limits parents to one vote only as opposed to one for each place. I do not see how he can do that. If he allows three votes for three places, he will be allowing a form of proportional representation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was intrigued by the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce), who has made his usual plea for proportional representation and has tried to tempt me into revealing the views that my right honourable Friend the Secretary of State and his successors might take. I am not convinced that there is any better case for proportional representation on school boards than elsewhere in the constitution. The hon. Gentleman has asked me to consider diversity. I make the same plea to him to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his brief reply. It was not quite the answer that I was looking for. I have already explained that I accept that my amendment would effectively impose a PR system. While I personally believe that such a system is preferable, I feel more constructively that my main concern is that such a system could be applied in certain areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must intervene. Am I correct in saying that the amendment will have to be put?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) were to withdraw his amendment and the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy (Dr. Moonie) were to speak afterwards, the Question would then have to be put.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) find it strange that the Minister totally ignored the point that I made in this short but interesting debate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, but I was coming to that. In passing, it may or may not surprise the committee to know that in one capacity—wearing one of my hats—I am the product of the single transferrable system of voting in that I am the rector of Dundee university. I am pleased to inform the Committee that I would have won on the first-past-the-
	<span class='label label-info column'>322</span>
post system. However, I should explain to the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion), that although it was a non-party-political election the candidates included two other Members of the House—the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) and the hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh), who was not then a Member and who came bottom of the poll. It is relevant to school boards that the system works in non party-political circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried that the Minister has not answered the practical point raised by the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy (Dr. Moonie). He said that where a proportional system will not be used, or where it is not recommended, parents need to know how many votes they will have. If there are four parent members, is it right to assume that however many candidates there are—assuming that there are more than four—the parents will have four votes with a ballot paper on which they will put four crosses? People in England, especially those in London boroughs, are familiar with that; they have three-member local government wards. It would be helpful if the Minister were to clarify whether that will be the position. Given the bounds of order, I encourage the Minister to intervene to explain. Are we right to assume that if there are to be so many members—

I do not wish unduly to embarrass the Minister. If he does not know the answer, I hope that he will accept that my recommendation of allowing local authorities to consider whether a single transferrable vote or a proportional system might help to resolve the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that only a convoluted system like that could make the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Actually, the answer lies in the absence of other candidates and the smallness of the electorate. I do not stand wholly rebuked on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am serious in my belief that some local authorities may wish to make a recommendation along those lines. Joking and party politics apart, I believe that it may have some merit. I do not propose to press the amendment to a Division. It is more prescriptive than I would wish it to be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have had a communication; it does not help much, but I gave a commitment to the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth to consider the guidance given to local authorities. He had argued that it would be daft to have different systems operating in different parts of Scotland. The hon. Member for Gordon urges me to allow for that. I looked at blank faces and felt anxieties about the various systems that he described. My initial liberal feeling to allow diversity was pulled up short as I thought of the poor electors having to struggle with whether they had one vote to cast among five candidates or five votes for five candidates. If local authorities were allowed to choose their system—the original proposal until the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth bent my ear

By asking me to state the position, the hon. Member for Gordon puts me in difficulty.

The amendment deals with the election of parent members to school boards, on which they will form the majority. It deals also with candidates' election addresses, and the question of election addresses put out by candidates is problematic. In the recent district council elections, when asked to fill in the description of candidate, the Scottish National party wrote "male" instead of Scottish National party and so stood as the male candidate. He did not win, so it did not bear on the outcome, but such procedures can be made a mess of and we must get the formula right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Everyone accepts that it should be a secret ballot, but it should not be a blind ballot. That may happen if the electors—the parents—do not have sufficient knowledge about the candidates for parent members of the boards. They must know what sort of people they are and what their views are on a range of issues. For example, if someone puts himself or herself forward as a parent member of a school board, the electors should know about that person's attitude toward an issue such as admissions to the school. The policy on admissions will be controlled by the education authority, but when demand for places in the school outstrips the places available and there is a waiting list to get into the school, the school board will decide which pupils will be accepted. It is important that people know the individual candidate's attitude on that matter when they vote in an election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under this legislation, it will be possible for the school board to be delegated extra powers, including control over the per capita expenditure in the school. Candidates should make known to the electors how they believe that that money should be spent. That was raised by the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) when he said that one lobby may be prepared to have all the money spent on new computers while another lobby may wish to spend the money on musical and cultural activities. That must be dealt with in the election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Discipline and school rules should also be included in the election issues. Everyone should know what the candidates feel about such issues. The school board may take over responsibility for those in future. What
	<span class='label label-info column'>326</span>
will be the attitude of the candidates toward school lets? That is important. Whom will they allow to use the school out of school hours? People should know the candidates' views on that before they vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Voters have the right to know the candidates' views on the ultimate question of opting out. The Minister will make an important announcement in Perth on Thursday and the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) will move a resolution, which may be carried, calling for opting out. School boards will be the mechanism through which decisions to opt out in future will be made. Therefore, it is important that candidates make their views on that known to the electors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a range of issues on which the electors will have a right to know the candidate's position. That information will have to be included in an election address together with personal details about the candidates such as who they are, which school their child attends and which year it is in. What kind of person are electors being asked to vote for? I believe that 150 words is not sufficient to allow individual candidates to discuss the issues and to make their views clear to the electors. It would be far better if they were given more scope to say more about themselves and their attitudes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not a controversial amendment and I am sure that the Minister will agree that there is nothing in it that will divide the Committee. One hundred and fifty words could just as easily be 250 words. That would give the candidates more space to explain their policies and outlooks and would give the voters a better deal because they would know how to vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is such a thing as voter fatigue. Most parents who vote in an election may know one or two of the candidates, but it is unlikely that they will know all the candidates. It is important, therefore, that they get a chance to learn about the candidates whom they do not know. The Minister is a reasonable man and I am sure that he will agree to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If there were to be a 250-word statement as under the first of the proposed amendments, it would take up 25 to 30 lines of the text of schedule 1—it would probably go only as far as line 25. As candidates we have all had the miserable experience of trying to condense our views into paragraphs of 100 or 150 words for newspapers. A statement of 250 words would be a more reasonable proposition.

Subsection (2) specifies that when the board is first set up, some members—that is, half the total—will hold office for only two years because eventually there will be a rolling system with all members holding office for four years, but with half the members being replaced every two years.

The purpose of the amendment is to meet the point of the hon.

7 child could be elected. That would be for a four-year period, for the last three years of which they would have no real interest in the school because their child would have moved on. The same would apply in secondary schools where a parent of an S5 or S6 pupil could be elected. For three years they could be on the board but would have no interest in the school because their child would no longer be at the school. Knowing how easily we have become confused tonight, could the Minister take some of those comments on board and possibly come back to this on Report?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point that the hon. Member makes about parents being elected for a four-year term of office when they will not continue to be parents of children at the school is one that we have thought about carefully. It does not arise specifically out of the amendment although I see why the hon. Gentleman has linked it with the amendment. We received quite strong representations about continuity and we took the view that allowing parents to continue in office would provide some continuity of experience. I do not accept the argument that all parents would be interested only in their own children. Having parents on the board who may not have children currently in the school could be a balancing factor along the lines that the hon. Gentleman and some of his hon. Friends advocated in earlier debates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 50, in page 3, line 26, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"unless otherwise specified in such notice such resignation shall have immediate effect".</p></blockquote>
The Bill does not deal with the problem of resignations and when they take effect. This is a probing amendment to find out how the Minister sees the conduct of resignations. I am sure that he will be able to answer the point without too much hassle. I am sorry that he is being pressed so rapidly for answers to questions that he perhaps did not expect to reach today. If there is any difficulty, I can seek leave to withdraw the amendment and bring it back another time or simply hope that the Government Whip draws stumps soon, but if the Minister can answer now that will be fine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill provides for a member to be able to resign at any time by giving written notice either to the clerk to the board, or to the education authority. The amendment would cause any letter of resignation by a board member to have immediate effect unless it specified otherwise. Under the terms of the Bill, no minimum or maximum period of notice is specified. It is not clear to me why the hon. Gentleman sees a need for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the letter of resignation is unclear on the point, the clerk could easily check with the retiring member. In the main, these will be small, local bodies. To introduce a provision for resignation to have immediate effect unless otherwise specified would add to the clerk's
	<span class='label label-info column'>330</span>
task and might give rise to unfortunate mistakes. On the other hand, possible unfortunate results are unlikely and will be small, so this seems to me to be a matter which can be judged in either direction. If the hon. Gentleman sees some reason why we should depart from the present position in the Bill, which allows for flexibility, I shall be pleased to consider the amendment. If he has simply tabled the amendment to assure himself that there are proper resignation procedures, he may rest assured.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was the point of the amendment. The Minister has clarified the position. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 2, in page 3, line 35, leave out from "arising" to end of line 37 and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"a by-election shall be held as soon as possible, and in any event within a period of three months".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 85, in page 3, line 36, leave out from "held" to end of line 37 and insert "immediately".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is self-explanatory and need not detain the Committee. It is important that when a by-election is due it takes place quickly. If school boards are to work effectively, it would not be practical or sensible for a casual vacancy to be left open. One group might be unrepresented on the board for some time. The time limit in the amendment is not necessarily the right one, but I am anxious that by-elections should take place expeditiously. There should be just enough time for arrangements to be made and the by-elections to take place. There should not be a longer delay than that, although problems in the long summer holiday might have to be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend the Under Secretary of State will accept the principle of the amendment. Even though the time limit may not be ideal, I hope that the purpose of the amendment will commend itself to my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the provision in the Bill was to avoid having too frequent elections. My right honourable Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) was concerned about costs, as was my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Monro). A by-election needs just as much organisation as a full, regular election. If elections come round too often, there is a danger that the electorate will be turned off and the impact of the elections reduced. Nevertheless, I accept that the provisions could result in a board carrying a vacancy for up to two years and I know that my right honourable Friend's anxiety is shared by the Scottish Parent-Teacher Council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The council's anxiety, interestingly enough, was that the parental majority might be lost

for that time if a casual vacancy were to occur. It is impractical for by-elections to be held immediately. Amendment No. 85 takes no account of the possibility that a biennial election may be very close when a casual vacancy arises. By contrast, amendment No. 2 allows three months' grace to take account of such circumstances. Accordingly, I am happy to accept amendment No. 2.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a commonsense amendment. I appreciate my hon. Friend the Minister's point about cost, but we must balance cost against the effective working of the school boards. The amendment would enable the boards to be more effective and I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Minister for accepting it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the right honourable Member seeking leave to withdraw the amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, Mr. Knox, I am certainly not seeking to withdraw it. My hon. Friend the Minister has accepted it. In the light of my hon. Friend's recommendation, despite his views on some other issues, I had hoped that the whole Committee might accept it. That was my hope and expectation. I trust that you, Mr. Knox, will not dash that hope and expectation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>332</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Knox. How will the Minister sustain his reputation with Scottish Conservatives if he keeps behaving like this?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a matter for the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendment is to specify that a board member who ceases to be eligible to stand as a board member should leave immediately and not be allowed to complete his term of office as the Bill suggests. We seek to clarity what happens when such a member ceases to be eligible for board membership. Perhaps the Minister will clarify that. We believe that the person should leave office straight away.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
