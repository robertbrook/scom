	<div class='title'>SCOTTISH HOMES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 68, in page 43, line 33, after 'Scottish Homes', insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'shall be not less than half its membership'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to discuss the following amendments: No. 33, in page 43, line 33, after 'Homes' insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'shall be 5 members'.</p></blockquote>
No. 110, in page 44, line 10, after 'members', insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'subject to a quorum of five members.'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I can dispose of the introduction of the amendment expeditiously. Given the wide remit proposed for Scottish Homes and the diversity of interests that should be represented by its membership, which we have already discussed, it is essential to safeguard the representative character of the membership. It should represent the various interest groups. The Scottish Federation of Housing Associations, has argued that it would make sense to have at least nine people on the board of Scottish Homes. According to the logic of that, the quorum should be no less than half the minimum number of members. Irrespective of how many members there are on the board, it is vital that they should not meet and take decisions unless all the interests of which it seeks to take stock are represented. It makes sense to insert on to the face of the Bill a minimum quorum, which the amendment seeks to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should make clear the Government's position. If he is unable to accept the technical wording of the amendment, I should like an assurance that the regulations or guidance or whatever flows from the primary legislation will make it clear that the Secretary of State will insist that there is a proper and adequate safeguard for the number of people who will constitute the board of Scottish Homes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a constructive suggestion from the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood). I hope that the Minister will give us some information. I want to put it on record that the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire may be surprised at the
	<span class='label label-info column'>374</span>
point on the amendment paper that we have reached. Opposition Members offered the Government progress which would have enabled them to dispose of this group of amendments—and nine further ones—at the previous sitting. Due to their failure to agree on a reasonable timetable for the consideration of the Bill, we find ourselves in the present circumstances. But I am anxious to make progress and to ensure that we have a constructive debate on the details of the Bill. I hope that the Minister will tell us something about the quorum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Scotland (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments seek to fix the quorum for the board of Scottish Homes at either five members or half the membership. The Bill provides that the quorum shall be such as Scottish Homes itself may determine, subject to any directions given by the Secretary of State. The provision in paragraph 14 of schedule 1 is almost identical to that applied to the Housing Corporation by paragraph 7 of schedule 6 to the Housing Associations Act 1985, and to the Scottish Development Agency by paragraph 12 of schedule 1 to the 1975 Act setting up that body. It is a common form of provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will appreciate that the amendments could lead to practical difficulties depending on the numbers of members that Scottish Homes has and how it decides to organise its business. Although I am sure that the major decisions of Scottish Homes will be the subject of majority decisions of the board, it seems unwise to require all board decisions to be the decision of a specific and substantial number of members. In some minor or formal matters perhaps only two or three would suffice. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will seek to withdraw his amendment, failing which I must ask the Committee to reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a slightly disappointing answer. I do not wish to press the amendment to a Division, but Opposition Members are becoming accustomed to listening to precedent being quoted as the only reason for resisting amendments. Of course, precedent must play a part, but by itself it is not a good enough reason for resisting every amendment. But I do not wish to press the amendment. I hear what the Minister says and I think that people will be interested to see how matters work out in practice. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 62, in page 43, line 39, after 'Homes', insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'shall withdraw from the meeting while the matter is being considered or determined.'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 63, in page 44, line 8, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(5) Scottish Homes shall maintain a register of financial and business interests of its members, in which members of Scottish Homes shall enter all relevant interests and which will be open to inspection by the public.'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0286">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>375</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These are probing amendments. As the Minister will know, they would bring the current practice in local authorities into line with what is proposed for Scottish Homes. If we are to make much use of precedent, why not use some of the precedents found in local authorities? It would not cost the Government anything and it would be of some benefit if local government procedures in this regard were translated into Scottish Homes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that we can deal with this set of amendments fairly briefly. Hon. Members may recall that the first few minutes of our consideration of the Bill were occupied with considering an hon. Members interests. Inevitably, where substantial amounts of money are being dealt with by a public body, it is important that the public should be satisfied that everything is being done with complete propriety. Where members of a board such as Scottish Homes are disbursing or investing substantial sums and taking decisions which could be advantageous or disadvantageous to different companies and groups, it is important that everything is seen to be above board. Unfortunately, especially under the present Administration, from time to time doubts are raised about advantages that are given. I suppose the obvious example at present is contract cleaning services, which local authorities and health authorities are required to put out to tender, and clearly financial interests are involved. Ground rules should be established, and that is what we are seeking in this group of amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a little surprised that hon. Members think that the provisions already in the Bill relating to hon. Members' interests are insufficient. That said, the issues are important, and I welcome the opportunity to assure the Committee that the controls which we propose meet the requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I speak about the amendments, I should say a little about the sort of people we expect Scottish Homes' members to be. So that it can make the substantial impact on Scottish housing that we envisage, we expect its members to have relevant experience and proven ability. Such people will inevitably come from backgrounds and, in many cases, have interests of direct value to the new body. We cannot expect them to become willing to become members if we require total divestment of those interests, but we can expect prospective members either to dispose of interests which are prejudicial to their work for Scottish Homes or not to take part in decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill makes such provision in paragraphs 4 and 15 of schedule 1. Paragraph 4 places a duty on the Secretary of State to satisfy himself that members do not have prejudicial interests before appointment and requires him to confirm from time to time that the member still has no such interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 15 deals with individual decisions of Scottish Homes, and not only requires a member to declare an interest but explicitly precludes that person from taking any further part in the deliberation or decision, subject to the ability of the board to decide, in relation to matters not involving
	<span class='label label-info column'>376</span>
contracts, that the interest is not prejudicial to the member's continued participation. I cannot see that there is a deficiency in those arrangements which warrants the change proposed in amendment No. 62. I do not think that a register of member's interests as proposed in amendment No. 63 would add usefully to the comprehensive controls which I have already described. The provisions of paragraphs 4 and 15 of schedule 1 are modelled closely on those in paragraphs 2 and 13 of schedule 1 to the Scottish Development Agency Act 1975. They are adequate for the SDA and they will be adequate for Scottish Homes. I see no merit in creating a patchwork quilt of different statutory controls in relation to similar bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of that statement I feel sure that the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) will wish to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am tempted to do that. I will study the Minister's remarks in detail when the 	<i>Official Report</i> is published, but I do not see how—since we are to have no published minutes and no guaranteed access to the information because earlier amendments were resisted by the Government—it will be possible for lay persons and interested parties to satisfy themselves beyond reasonable doubt that everything that Scottish Homes does is above board. I am not impugning the quality or integrity of any of the members who will be appointed to Scottish Homes; I am certain that they will be bona fide people of great experience. But justice must be seen to be done, and if the provisions in the amendments before the Committee are good enough for local government purposes I do not see why they should not also serve for Scottish Homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not see what it would cost to have a register of interests. If it is good enough for Members of Parliament, why is it not good enough for members of Scottish Homes? What would it cost the Government? What difficulty or embarrassment will this save members who serve on that body?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have some sympathy with what the hon. Gentleman is saying about a register of interests. However, I remind him that Members of Parliament having declared interests in the Register of Members' Interests'—as they should properly do any time they are involved—do not then withdraw from any proceedings that take place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that point; that is a true statement of fact. I have tabled the amendments to tease out the Government's intentions on how they would attack this problem. The Minister quotes precedent. Precedents in terms of other bodies may be fair and reasonable in their context, but in the context of Scottish Homes, where direct commercial interests are involved, matters may be different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not press the amendment to a Division, because that would be a waste of time, but I put it to the Minister that his refusal to consider it will serve to increase suspicion in those who already have suspicious minds that something underhand may be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0287">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>377</span>
going on beneath the surface. If the provisions are not explicit, and if the system set up to give protection in such matters is not properly set out, people may fall foul of them inadvertently, which would be a shame. I am not entirely satisfied, but I will study what the Minister said in the fullness of time and perhaps return to the matter later. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 64, in page 44, line 14, after 'Homes', insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'shall establish a committee for each region or islands area and each local authority which is a housing authority shall appoint a representative to the committee for their area and.'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we shall take the following amendments:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No. 69, in page 44, line 17, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(1A) Scottish Homes shall establish regional committees with members from the region and on which at least two members of Scottish Homes will serve, one of whom will act as chairman of the committee.'.</p></blockquote>
No. 70, in page 44, line 19, after '(1)', insert 'and (1A) above'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Committee will agree to spend a few minutes on the amendment because it has important ramifications for all of us as constituency Members on both sides of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The establishment of committees for each region or islands area and each local authority that is a housing authority and appointing representatives to those committees is an important addition to the system proposed for Scottish Homes. I come from a local authority that has predominantly rural, landward areas to cope with, as do other Members of the Committee. There is a fear that the preponderance of the work and the focus of Scottish Homes' activities will, because of the quantity of the housing that is required to be attended to in the central industrial belt, stray away from the needs that are felt day in, day out in rural and landward areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may say that that is entirely wrong and that the balance will be uppermost at all times in the mind of the board and the chairman and chief executive of Scottish Homes when it is eventually set up, and I should be happy to hear him give such an assurance. However, if my analysis is right, and the burden of the work will inexorably take Scottish Homes into urban areas and the peripheral estates of the major cities in Scotland, there is a danger of becoming divorced from the probems in rural areas. We must take account of that and the best method would be to set up a system of local committees. We know that Scottish Homes has the power under the Bill to set up a fairly flexible system of subcommittees as it thinks fit. Again, if the Minister thought that writing in a regional or area systems hierarchy within Scottish Homes was too inflexible but he was nevertheless prepared to accept the principle, that would leave me a good deal happier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The belief north of the border is that there needs to be a counterbalance to make sure that the spread and
	<span class='label label-info column'>378</span>
focus of Scottish Homes' work is across the gamut of problems encountered in different areas, and one way would be to require Scottish Homes to set up organisational committees on a geographical basis with a statutory input from local authorities and other relevant interests. That would tie it to the local communities as many housing associations are now. What would it cost the Government? What difficulties would be created if the Government accepted the proposal? I shall be interested to hear what the Minister says because it is an important amendment. I hope that he can reassure us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the anxiety of the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire about the need for representation for rural areas. My experience of quangos appointed by this Administration suggests that it is not the rural areas or the leafy suburbs that need to worry about their interests being taken into account by Scottish Homes, but the poor suffering people in the worst housing conditions in Scotland. The Secretary of State will not appoint people from Easterhouse, Drumchapel or Pilton to serve on the body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire made a fair point about decentralised activity in management in considering Scottish Homes. My hon. Friends started life suspicious but prepared to listen to the Government's proposals on Scottish Homes. As we have heard more about how it is to be constituted and operated, we are becoming increasingly hostile to the centralised quango that the Government have in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The manner in which the Minister is conducting his affairs in Committee demonstrates the contempt in which the nation of Scotland is held by this minority Administration—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] It is all very well for the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth) to shake his head and make animal noises—we know how much influence he has in the Administration. I can understand why my hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes) gave up listening to the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) at a meeting at the Scottish Office yesterday. He was treated to the same performance as we are subject to in Committee. The Minister is given notes by officials from the Scottish Office—here comes another note—which he reads out in no order and which frequently bear no relationship to the points that have been made in the debate. We have difficulties in Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Member give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I am getting bored with the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker). He intervenes from time to time, but he has not contributed much to the Committee's deliberations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Lambie. If boredom were a yardstick for deciding whether hon. Members should shut up, I would suggest that the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) remained silent for ever.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0288">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>379</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman knows that that is not a point of order. I am often bored, but I still have to remain here—without payment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we make points in Committees, we hope that a debate will ensue, and that there will be an exchange of ideas and perhaps even a meeting of minds on some subjects, such as whether the affairs of a gigantic national quango determining policy for housing in Scotland should be decentralised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government propose that Scottish Homes should be set up with fewer than nine members—or up to nine members—appointed by the Secretary of State. They will conduct their affairs in private. We do not yet know how much authority they will have over the affairs of local housing authorities. We know that they will probably have an increasing share of the housing budget and that local authorities will have a diminishing share. We are legislating to establish a body that will have a massive budget and power and influence over the housing of the people of Scotland, yet we cannot even get assurances that the affairs of people in diverse localities of Scotland will be properly considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I quote the White Paper to the Minister:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A view which commanded widespread support was that Scottish Homes should have a decentralised structure below Board level. The Government endorse this view and will take it into account in the further planning of the management structure of Scottish Homes."</p></blockquote>
If previous debates are anything to go by, I fear that we shall simply be told that there are no precedents or that it would be difficult and we must leave Scottish Homes free to do what it likes. But the Government have specifically said in a White Paper that they intend to decentralise consideration of the affairs of Scottish Homes. There is an irresistible argument that such a body should conduct its affairs in a way which gives people access to it and enables people in different localities and regions in Scotland to influence considerations which will affect the management of the housing estates in their areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have already acknowledged the case for that, so can we have a reply from the Minister, just for once? Will he throw away the brief that is lying in front of him and answer our points? Here comes another note. This is an absurd way of conducting the Committee. I think that it was my hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley who described a conversation with the Minister as a dialogue with a parrot. Perhaps the Minister could live up to the principles for which he was once renowned of being a reasonable person who could recognise arguments and cases. Here is an obvious one. Perhaps he could respond to it positively—off the cuff.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is some merit in what the amendment is trying to achieve, but I find it disturbing, as I have throughout our proceedings, that the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) seems to spend all his time hurling personal abuse of varying kinds at Conservative Members. That has not been true of other Opposition Members, some of whose arguments have been well-
	<span class='label label-info column'>380</span>
thought-out and presented and made a real contribution to the Committee's debates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry to say that the hon. Member for East Lothian, who is leading for the Opposition, is the worst example that I have ever seen of an Opposition spokesperson throughout the last three Parliaments. He has not once made a logical, sensible, carefully-thought-out, well-prepared, articulated speech to put the Opposition's point of view. If anyone is doing a disservice to Scotland and to the House and the Committee, it is the hon. Gentleman. Before he starts throwing bricks, he should realise that he lives in a glass-house, and his glass-house is the most vulnerable of all. I recommend to him that he cease this practice of personal abuse or he may find himself on the receiving end; and the hon. Gentleman is more vulnerable than most of us to that sort of abuse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may assist my hon. Friend. The hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) called for a meeting of minds. I am sure that I speak for hon. Members on all sides of the Committee when I say that if he can show us where his mind is, we should be happy to meet it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. It was a splendid example of what the hon. Gentleman is liable to expose himself to if he does not return to properly discussing the matters before us. He should take a leaf out of the book of the hon. Members for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) and for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion), who at least have come here prepared, have done their work and have presented their case effectively and well. The fact that we may not agree with it does not mean that we do not respect the presentation or the hard work that has gone into it, because we do. The hon. Member for East Lothian comes here so badly prepared and ill-briefed that he can handle his attack on the Government only by personal abuse. I recommend that he stop that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been accused this morning of showing contempt for the Committee. I have shown no contempt. I consider with the utmost care all the Opposition's amendments. The hon. Member for East Lothian is too anxious to become the nation's conscience. He also pays tribute to off-the-cuff speeches. Throughout the Committee he has made constant off-the-cuff speeches, for the precise reason that he is not prepared to do his homework; he is not prepared to get to the root of the problems which affect Scotland's housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is more important, so far the Labour party has failed to produce a comprehensive solution to Scotland's housing problems. We have put before the House and the Committee a serious solution to the problems of the homeless and others in Scotland. These matters require the most detailed and thorough consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, in his fair speech, mentioned the vital need to achieve the right balance between the cities and rural areas. I agree that that must happen.

The amendments would impose on Scottish Homes a management structure which would be entirely inappropriate to many of the matters in which Scottish Homes will become involved and would be liable to cause conflict with local authorities rather than to improve relationships.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In general, it is right to refrain from predetermining Scottish Homes' structure below board level. We must allow Scottish Homes to produce its own proposals; we shall probably commission consultants to assist them in doing so. Against that general background, the amendments are misconceived.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for East Lothian asked about decentralisation. Decentralisation will take place. Scottish Homes will be a national body which will often look to local authorities as sources of advice on the needs of their areas. Scottish Homes will have a decentralised organisational structure to assist co-ordination with local authorities and other local interests and improve the sensitivity with which services are delivered. However, this is very different from the creation of a series of regional offshoots of the board, which, taken together with the decentralised organisational structure, comes close to setting up a number of local development agencies in place of a single national agency. This would detract from the overall effectiveness of Scottish Homes. It would also create a risk of turning Scottish Homes into a direct rival to local authorities, because both of them would be seeking to operate at local level. This is precisely the anxiety that hon. Gentlemen expressed in earlier debates on Scottish Homes' relationship to local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that. I am a bit puzzled about what the Minister means by saying that Scottish Homes will have a decentralised structure, when he would not admit the need for regional committees. What does he mean? Will there be a physical presence in the district and regional areas? Will members of staff be employed in the areas so that there can be a one-door approach to the gamut of problems that are being considered in the various areas?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I understood him correctly, the Minister also said that those ubiquitous management consultants would be enlisted to assist. If the aforementioned ubiquitous management consultants came up with the idea of a decentralised regional committee structure, presumably the Secretary of State would not rule it out. I should like an assurance about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, in suggesting regional committees, I was not in any way trying to set up a series of 12, 24 or 53 little Scottish Homes. I agree that that would detract from the purpose of having a national agency with a clear focus and national strategy. But that is a different proposition from a system of advisory committees which are the eyes and the ears of Scottish Homes in the local areas. We may be talking about two entirely different things.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am trying to argue for a locally based approach so that people do not think that Scottish Homes is based in Glasgow or Edinburgh or anywhere else, but
	<span class='label label-info column'>382</span>
that it has a local focus in the regions and districts. There should be powerful and sensitive advisory committees locally which know local circumstances and can feed information and assist the process of developing local schemes and strategies. That will feed up through the system to the focus of the board. That is not by any means a system of completely separate Scottish Homes organisations with Chinese walls between them, all operating in different way and travelling in different directions. I agree entirely that that would detract immensely from what Scottish Homes could achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not press the amendment to a Division because there may be some common ground between us. But we should understand the Government's thinking on this question so that those who study the proceedings of the Committee can grasp what they envisage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can reassure the hon. Gentleman. During consultation we received many representations that Scottish Homes should have a decentralised structure. Many of those who made representations cited the regional management of the SSHA as an example of how Scottish Homes should be organised, in its landlord division and generally in carrying out its functions. It is important to note that the SSHA's present decentralised structure relates to the organisation of staff, not of board members. In paragraph 2.18 of the White Paper the Government endorsed a decentralised organisational structure and proposed that the legislation should not place restrictions on the board of Scottish Homes on how its management structure should be organised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked whether that would be a matter for Scottish Homes, if it so decided to organise it. The answer is that it would be. A decentralised administrative structure based on local offices, as the SSHA has today, is what I envisage will happen. That will, or course, be a decision for Scottish Homes. I would expect Scottish Homes to consult widely with local authorities and other bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been criticised for modelling Scottish Homes too closely on the Scottish Development Agency. That happened because we believe that the Scottish Development Agency has had substantial success in Scotland in helping to create more employment prospects and has attained other achievements since the 1975 Act, which was introduced by a Labour Government. The success of the SDA has been so great that we are entitled to follow many of the precedents that it has set.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is interesting that the Minister should refer to the parallel with the Scottish Development Agency, because my understanding is that the SDA has recently announced its intention to decentralise its operations. The model to which it is working breaks up Scotland into seven regions, excluding the Highlands and Islands Development Board area. The SDA is moving in the direction of decentralised management and control, and if the Minister is suggesting that Scottish Homes should follow that parallel, why not?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0290">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>383</span>
There are many SSHA houses in my constituency, and if the Minister were to tell an SSHA tenant in Dunbar that the SSHA was a splendidly decentralised organisation and that tenants had easy access to SSHA offices, never mind SSHA board members, he would be wrong. The local office of the Scottish Special Housing Association for my area is in Palmerston place in Edinburgh. There may be SSHA houses in the Borders whose tenants are also supposed to deal with that office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to be too critical of the management style of the SSHA, because it is pretty good at its job, but no one can suggest that its headquarters are easily accessible to tenants. I am afraid that the Minister is confirming some of our fears. The new body will have much more power and authority and, I hope, far wider-ranging functions than those of the SSHA. It will deal with housing associations and with tenants inherited from the SSHA, it will oversee the housing functions of local authorities, it will have a direct relationship with owner-occupiers as regards improvement and repair grants, and it will also have the whole new job of developing private landlordism in Scotland. Therefore, the nine people or fewer who will man the board of Scottish Homes will have a wide remit. There is thus a legitimate fear that people who live at any distance from Scottish Homes headquarters or from where its board members live will find it increasingly difficult to have their point of view taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to the Scottish Development Agency. My understanding is that the SDA is currently in the process of decentralising its moneys and structure. I am prepared to accept that it is not necessarily desirable to put this on the face of the Bill and I should be happy to accept a clear undertaking from the Scottish Office, if such a thing is possible, that the Government intend to establish a decentralised management structure with sub-committees covering different areas of responsibility and different geographical areas. That would help to allay some of the fears that have been expressed on this subject, but so far we have not had much reassurance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Scottish Development Agency is to use a decentralised structure, as we expect Scottish Homes to do. The hon. Gentleman was critical of the SSHA's present arrangements, but on consultation the representations that we received suggested that the regional management of the SSHA is an example of the way in which Scottish Homes should be organised. Like the hon. Gentleman, I also represent SSHA tenants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is a bit nearer to Palmerston place in Edinburgh.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We believe that there is adequate provision in the Bill for Scottish Homes to form committees, and I am sure that, when appropriate, local authorities will be closely involved. The amendments would, however, impose an unnecessary and inappropriate management
	<span class='label label-info column'>384</span>
structure. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will seek to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may insinuate another question into the Minister's mind before seeking to withdraw the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My local authority, Roxburgh district council, currently has a very close relationship with the SSHA, whereby it factors SSHA houses, selects prospective tenants, issues tenancies and looks after and factors the stock in places like Hawick, Kelso and Jedburgh. My constituents want to know what will happen when Scottish Homes is set up. From what the Minister said earlier, it seems that it will have a decentralised structure. I assume that that means that it will move outside Edinburgh and that local access to it will be no worse than the access at present available to my constituents. Any SSHA tenant in the borders can walk into any district local authority office and raise a complaint, ask a question, pay the rent or ask for a transfer of tenancy. Tenants can walk down the high street and through a door that is open to them without going anywhere near phones, buses to Edinburgh or anything else. If there is to be no physical presence in areas such as my constituency, what will happen to constituents of mine who are currently SSHA tenants but who are to become tenants of Scottish Homes? They may find themselves dealing with a far more remote and difficult structure for making their complaints and views known.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made a plea for continuity in the arrangements, which he said are working well. I can reassure him that the current arrangements, such as factoring by his district council and other Scottish local authorities, will be unchanged by the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>GENERAL FUNCTIONS OF SCOTTISH HOMES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 87, in page 2, line 24, leave out 'any person', and insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'the benefit of local housing authorities; housing associations; housing co-operatives; landlords and developers approved by local authorities; owner occupiers and tenants'.</p></blockquote>
The amendment gives us a brief opportunity to explore the type of advisory service that the Government have in mind for Scottish Homes. Clause 2(2)(e) will enable Scottish Homes to—
	<br><blockquote><p>"provide or assist in the provision of advisory or other services or facilities for any person".</p></blockquote>
This raises questions about the type of bodies that the Government may have in mind for support or assistance through the agency of Scottish Homes.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0291">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>385</span>
The amendment would restrict the scope for the provision of such advisory services at public expense to:
	<br><blockquote><p>"local housing authorities; housing associations; housing co-operatives; landlords and developers approved by local authorities; owner occupiers and tenants".</p></blockquote>
Concern has been expressed, as the Minister knows, about the possibility of the unrestricted encouragement of private landlords of all types. There have been bad experiences with unscrupulous landlords in Scotland over the years. Fears have been legitimately expressed that the Government's strategy could lead to further encouragement of such bad practices. We want to provide for ways in which local authorities can monitor and approve the practices of private landlords to maintain some control over their conduct. One way of doing that would be to ensure that only approved landlords could have access to the support services of Scottish Homes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eastwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened with interest to the Hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson), but I think that the amendment is unduly restrictive. It would preclude Scottish Homes from giving advice to people who intended to set up a housing association or a housing co-operative. I do not imagine that that is the purpose of the hon. Gentleman's amendment, but I think that that would be its effect. I raise the point because I know of people in my own constituency who are considering setting up such bodies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Arbuthnot 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wanstead and Woodford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You should savour this moment, Mr. Lambie. I do not understand why the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) is trying explicitly to exclude himself from the advice that could be given by Scottish Homes. I have experience which I believe no other Member of the Committee has because for many decades my family occupied a house in Berwickshire owned by a well-known family in Berwickshire—the family of the hon. Member for East Lothian. I invite the hon. Gentleman to explain why bad landlords should be excluded from advisory services offered by Scottish Homes. In many cases it is the bad landlords who need the advice, so they should not be excluded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are grateful to the hon. Member for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Arbuthnot) for speaking in the debate and laying bare to the world the Conservative party's soul. We have not seen it much in Scotland, but clearly he will give the Scots a taste of the Conservative medicine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman had the nerve to suggest that bad landlords should be advised by Scottish Homes—not, I suspect, for the honourable reason that it might turn bad landlords into good ones. In my experience in Edinburgh—experience in Glasgow and elsewhere is similar—the only way in which bad landlords can be changed into good landlords is for them to be driven out by good landlords. Leopards do not change their spots. The drift of this and some of the other amendments, which I am sorry that the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire
	<span class='label label-info column'>386</span>
(Mr. Kirkwood) did not press, is to make sure that Scottish Homes does not become an advisory body to the Rachmans of this world. It may be taken over by the most unsuitable people and as the amendments will not be accepted it will not be accountable locally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 87 includes a reasonable list of people—not the "any persons" that the Government propose, which could include a long list of people whom councils have been trying to drive out of business because of their terrible practices. The Minister knows some of those practices. Edinburgh district council last year was forced to take out orders against a landlord who provided accommodation without a working toilet for young, vulnerable families. Rubbish was piled up in the toilet, including bedding and a spare cooker. Families were living in properties where the cookers were not connected, and the electricity had been cut off because the money that the tenants had given the landlord for electricity had been embezzled by him. The DHSS, which was paying for some of the rents, was also pursuing the landlord because he had embezzled not only that money, but some of the tenants' allowances as well. Such are the "any persons" who could go to Scottish Homes for advice if the Bill is not amended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to ensure that there is a limited list. If it appears that someone has been excluded who should not reasonably have been left out, we would accept an amendment to our amendment to cover that. The amendment refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"the benefit of local housing authorities".</p></blockquote>
They have at least some respectability, are not with us for ever and are electable. The amendment also includes housing associations, which have articles of association and, with a few disreputable exceptions, are generally fairly representative of the local community. As for housing co-operatives, we shall take no lectures from the Government on this because Glasgow has a tremendous record in this respect. Other councils have been studying and setting up co-operatives, having benefited not from the advice given by Glasgow district council but from co-operative members themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further down the list come landlords and developers approved by local authorities. That is crucial. We are not excluding landlords from coming to Scottish Homes. We say that bad landords who want to change—I have my doubts about some—should get approval from their local authorities and provide proof that they are willing to run their properties honestly, reasonably and in such a way that the tenants and the local authorities will approve. In Edinburgh environmental health officers are to be brought in to look at landlords who were not even complying with environmental health laws. Those are the people that the amendment will bring to book. That is exactly what we want to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another category is owner-occupiers who may wish to become landlords and who seek the best possible advice. We have nothing against that. That is why we are writing this into the amendment. The Government have not written it into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is humbug for the Government to say that Labour has no ideas about Scottish Homes and no constructive proposals. Every constructive
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0292">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>387</span>
proposal—there have been hundreds from Labour—has been turned down by the Government and by their Back Benchers, who like to preach to us about it. It is clear that the Government believe that they have a blueprint. If the clause is passed unamended, it will be a blueprint for the fraudsters and a charter for the cheat landlords.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government resources and taxpayers' money will be used to give advice to those landlords who have perhaps been drummed out of one local authority area after another but have found a haven somewhere and have gone to Scottish Homes to seek approval. If Scottish Homes is run by honest and honourable people—again, the Government refuse to accept amendments to ensure that there is that safeguard—these people will be obliged, against their conscience, I suspect, to give advice to anyone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment makes it clear that we shall oppose the charter for cheats and cheating landlords. We shall block any attempt to allow the worst elements which now operate in the landlord profession to seek advice. In doing so, we shall protect the many honourable landlords operating in Edinburgh and throughout Scotland. We are trying to make sure that there is no slur on their name by ensuring that local authorities can approve landlords. We are trying to make sure that the good and honest landlords are not driven out by the bad.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have letters from landlords in my constituency who support legislation that Labour has backed to make sure that landlords are approved because they themselves have been driven out. Those landlords who take pride in their job and whose tenants are given suitable conditions in which to bring up their families, so they do not mind being tenants, are being driven out. The amendment will ensure that Scottish Homes plays no part in accelerating that process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At first glance, the amendment appears to have considerable merit, but when one looks a little more closely one realises that it is drawn fairly narrowly. It may mean that in some parts of the country, especially the more remote rural areas, it will be difficult for people who have property that could be leased and who wish to become landlords to obtain advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a large rural constituency. I hope that, if a landlord or farmer happened to have some spare property that he thought that he could lease, he could be advised by Scottish Homes. The answer is to go to the body set up by the Government so that such people can become specialists, just as small business men go to the Scottish Development Agency small business division to obtain advice and assistance. Often they get help from the people appointed by the SDA specifically for that task. I hope that that will be true when Scottish Homes comes into being.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I understand the intentions of the hon. Member for East Lothian and of other hon. Members, the amendment is drawn much too narrowly. For that reason, it would be unwise of the Committee to accept it in its present form. Hon.
	<span class='label label-info column'>388</span>
Members should recognise that people do not remain landlords for ever and a day. New people come into the market. Because of changing family circumstances, people may find themselves with a property that they no longer require. That often happens on farms. Equally, the property may be changed from a livestock farm into something which does not require the same number of people working on it, and more properties may become available. Therefore, the amendment is much too narrowly drawn and I hope that the Government will reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: After the hon. Gentleman's remarks earlier this morning, I am surprised that he can see any merit in any suggestion that I put forward. I assure him that the amendment is not intended to be restrictive. If the Minister or any other Conservative Member wishes to suggest a way of improving its drafting to achieve what I believe we all wish to see, we should be happy to consider it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the hon. Gentleman's point about the need to encourage people to let property which is standing empty. If necessary, I should be prepared to take him to my constituency to let him see the work being done by East Lothian district council, in co-operation with Shelter and others, on a rural house-leasing scheme, whereby people who have property standing empty are encouraged by the local authority, with the benefit of grants, advisory services and the rest of the back-up that it can provide, to improve their houses and let them. We are having great difficulty persuading farmers to let property, but a little progress is being made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to encourage that kind of innovative scheme. Certainly the amendment does not intend to restrict that approach. We want to achieve a filter or control to ensure that irresponsible, rapacious landlords cannot take advantage of free advice from Scottish Homes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Bill is drafted, there seems to be a totality to the availability of advice, whereas the amendment seems to restrict it considerably. If the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) has a desire to ensure that the glorious heritage of country cottages, steadings and so on is made available for housing and to sustain rural communities—I appreciate that he does, since he lives in the country—I am sure that both sides of the Committee would favour and want to foster that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We all want to achieve that, but we also want to deal with irresponsible landlords. It was a rare pleasure to hear from the hon. Member for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Arbuthnot) today. Indeed, there was a tantalising indication in 	<i>The Scotsman</i> yesterday that he might regale us with his thoughts at some stage of our proceedings. Here we have an example of the grandson of a Scottish tenant who is embittered by the dreadful experiences that he suffered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arbuthnot</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not for a moment suggest that the family of the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) were bad landlords. They were very acceptable landlords. I was flattered and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0293">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>389</span>
impressed that the hon. Gentleman was able to remember my name about a week ago. He must have so many other tenants that to remember one is quite a feat.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has evidently been a searing experience for the hon. Gentleman to come from such a background. I am grateful to him for letting it be known that his granny was a tenant of my grandfather in a property that, I hasten to add, has nothing to do with me now. Apparently, it was such a terrible experience for his family that he found it necessary to depart to the furthest shores of England, even unto Kent, and to maintain a sullen silence, in the Committee while voting with his hon. Friends, who are a beleagured minority in Scotland, to impose legislation that will create difficulties for tenants in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths) has said, the amendment would provide a method whereby local authorities could filter out support for inappropriate landlords. There always have been, and there always will be, landlords who indulge in bad practices, who exploit their tenants and do not look after their property. It would add insult to injury if such organisations or individuals could avail themselves of publicly funded advisory and support services, as could happen under the Bill. It is therefore not unreasonable to suggest a filtering process and a means of securing approval. We should be glad to have the Ministers views on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested to hear what my hon. Friend the Member for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Arbuthnot) had to say. He is well qualified to speak on this subject. He is professionally qualified as a barrister, qualified by experience as a former chairman of a council housing committee, and qualified by background in that his family were tenants in the private rented sector—tenants, as good fortune would have it—of the family of the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson). Whenever my hon. Friend wishes to contribute to the debate, he will be welcome to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) touched upon the heart of the matter when he said that the amendment was restrictive. We want Scottish Homes to give advice widely. Our aim is to assist as many people as possible to deal with their housing problems. The Bill allows Scottish Homes to provide such advice or assistance to any person. The Opposition seem to want to specify in the Bill those who may—and thus, by definition, those who may not—be advised by Scottish Homes. Given the wide remit that we propose for Scottish Homes to encourage new forms of tenure and innovative approaches to housing provision and management, it would not be helpful to tie its hands in that way. In my view, the amendment is unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How can the Minister call the amendment restrictive when it would allow all the co-ops already set up, the dozens in the process of being set up, more than 200 housing associations,

more than 1,000 landlords, 65 councils representing 5 million people, 1 million home owners and 1 million tenants—more than 7 million people, and more than the population Scotland—to go to Scottish Homes for advice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are a great many other bodies in housing and it would be wrong to exclude them. The advice that Scottish Homes will be able to give should be available to those who are directly affected as and when problems come up and they wish to consult experts. I assure hon. Members that the bodies listed in the amendment are those that we envisage would have the closest links with Scottish Homes, to share their experience and expertise. In particular, we see an important role for Scottish Homes in providing a bank of experience to help rural housing authorities, as the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) would no doubt wish, and small housing associations, but we hope that others involved in housing will also be encouraged and assisted by Scottish Homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that hon. Member for East Lothian will agree that it would be inadvisable to place unnecessary restrictions on the ability of Scottish Homes to encourage and assist anyone who may bring forward an innovative housing project, and that he will feel able to withdraw the amendment. If not, I shall have to ask the Committee to reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Doran 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. I just want to make a pedantic legal point. The Minister is right to say that the amendment is restrictive. It is an attempt to focus on those whom the Opposition see as most likely to benefit from the advice, and to exclude those whom we would regard as unsatisfactory landlords. As a pedantic lawyer, it strikes me that the provision in the Bill is extremely open ended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 2(2)(e) simply says that Scottish Homes may
	<br><blockquote><p>"provide or assist in the provision of advisory or other services or facilities for any person".</p></blockquote>
That is without prejudice to the generality of the other powers and functions given to Scottish Homes. Clearly, that paragraph would require to be read in conjunction with the functions and obligations placed on Scottish Homes and would therefore be restricted to housing matters. Given that the function of Scottish Homes is housing, and that it now has this new financial provision attached to it so that it can operate in the same way as banks, building societies and so on, and given that the obligation in clause 2(2)(e) is placed on it in such an open way, what restrictions does the Minister see applying to that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am thinking of my own experience of the Court of Sessions Act 1868, which allows ordinary individuals to force public authorities—of which Scottish Homes would be one—to carry out their responsibilities. If I were a landlord considering the terms of this legislation, and the open-ended nature of the provision, I might see an opportunity, for example, to dispense with paid staff engaged in planning and providing my organisation with financial advice as the open-ended nature of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0294">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>391</span>
provision would allow me to ask Scottish Homes to do that work for me. What restrictions are there? There seems to be no power to charge, but I may be wrong about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The heart of the matter is that this is a restrictive amendment and there are many bodies which are not included, Shelter, Age Concern, and so on. We think that it would be wrong to exclude bodies which have helpful, innovative projects on which they wish to have advice. I do not see that there is any possibility of legal action taking place. The hon. Gentleman is a lawyer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is true, though we have not seen fit to cross each other in the Scottish courts, whether on the same or different sides.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all recognise the need for Scottish Homes to be able to advise and assist all the bodies listed in the amendment, but the Government believe that it is also necessary to assist many other bodies as and when they come forward with sensible proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Far be it from me to assist the Minister in responding to my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran), but the provision in clause 2(2)(r) on page 3 of the Bill enables Scottish Homes to
	<br><blockquote><p>"make such charges as it thinks fit for any of its services".</p></blockquote>
I think that that covers the point made by my hon. Friend, although it seems that even the Minister did not know that it was in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As ever, I am disappointed with the Government's approach. They refuse to acknowledge that there are already abuses in the private rented sector and that there is a need to control those abuses. The Government refuse to recognise the legitimate fears about an increase in bad practices in the private rented sector in the future. We are suggesting a rather limited provision to make it possible for a local authority to ensure that Scottish Homes is not providing technical or advisory back-up to bad landlords, but once again the Minister is resisting it. We shall probably want to return later to this matter, in general if not in relation to advisory services. As there are probably more appropriate points at which to press the matter to a Division, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

That provision is not specific or strong enough in relation to tenant involvement. A great deal more has to be done to beef up the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far this morning, the focus has been to a great extent on the landlords. I am pleased to say that in this amendment the focus has switched to the tenants. The Government have made great claims about being the friend and defender of tenants in Scotland. In the White Paper, "Housing: The Government's Proposals for Scotland", it is claimed that the Tenants Rights (Scotland) Act 1980 has given tenants independence and peace of mind as a result of the rights conferred on them by the Government. In bringing forward the Bill, the Government have claimed that they are giving tenants even more rights and that a greater right of choice of different kinds of tenure will be available to tenants under this legislation, including co-operatives and other types of tenure. The Government have the new idea that tenants should have the right to pick a landlord. It is a restricted right, because one can use it only once and then it is lost. The Government do not draw attention to that aspect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 131 and 132 attempt to show the difference between a paper commitment to giving tenants rights and translating those paper rights into real increases in the range of choice and the participation by tenants in the management of their homes and in the formation of housing policy which will affect their enjoyment of their homes. The purpose of amendment No. 131 is to ensure that the development of tenant participation schemes is specifically within the power of Scottish Homes. There is all-party agreement to the principle, but we are trying to tease out all-party agreement to the practice of allowing tenants to participate in housing management. The amendment seeks to expand the influence and involvement of tenants and at the same time provide a much wider consultation process which we hope would operate at a decentralised level, as we hope that Scottish Homes itself will operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing radical changes concerning the rights and responsibilities of housing agencies. If tenants are to have any confidence that the changes will work to their benefit, they have to be satisfied that the implementation of the provisions of the Bill will be on the basis that the Government are prepared not only to listen to tenants, but to act on what they have to say. The approval of new landlords will be an important decision to be taken by Scottish Homes. New landlords are by nature unknown to tenants, and it is important for tenants to have access to the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0295">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>393</span>
decision-making process of Scottish Homes which will approve the new landlords who will be subject to the rights of tenants under the Bill. Tenants must be involved in some way in the decisions about who should be an approved landlord. They should know that when they are involved in those decisions what they have to say will be taken on board and acted upon. We go back to the old argument: if Scottish Homes is to be Glasgow or Edinburgh based, it will be in a poor position to know about landlords in the rest of Scotland. It is important that people at the local level have an input and a way of influencing the choices that Scottish Homes will make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that Scottish Homes will be taking over 83,000 SSHA houses, but in addition it will receive even more houses under the new pick-a-landlord scheme so that perhaps 150,000 or 200,000 houses will be directly under its control, and Scottish Homes, as manager, will be making decisions about rents, schemes for rehabilitation of houses and how to implement the repair service. In all those decisions, tenants must be involved and have a say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we genuinely want to involve tenants, we must make it possible for tenants to become involved, not only by setting up schemes but by laying on facilities that will enable tenants to participate in decisions. What strikes one in the large peripheral estates in any Scottish city is the number of tenants who by their very circumstances would find it almost impossible to attend meetings that are held in the centre of town or to go to offices to lobby or take part in meetings. If we seriously want people to come to meetings and take part in decisions, we must lay on facilities for them, including transport to meetings and creche facilities, because often tenants are single parents with young children, unable to go out in the evening, who, without creche facilities, simply cannot go to meetings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must also arrange access to independent housing advice. A tenant who has never been involved in housing management and the complicated decisions that must be made cannot be expected to participate on an equal footing with the officials of Scottish Homes. These must be access to independent housing advice from people who are genuinely independent of Scottish Homes. Most important of all, if we want tenants to participate, they cannot be dealt with on an individual basis; they must be allowed to form themselves into organisations, as they already do, and Scottish Homes must lay on the money to allow for the administration of tenants' organisations to allow them to participate in decision-making at a genuine level, as groups as well as individuals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 132 is tabled to ensure that Scottish Homes exercises its purpose as regards the provision of advice services and tenant participation within a reasonable period. Within six months of Scottish Homes being brought into being, it should take action to implement such changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are grateful to the Scottish Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux for suggesting the amendments. The association has said that in the last year for which it has figures available, 1986–87, it dealt with more than 50,000 house inquiries, about
	<span class='label label-info column'>394</span>
people losing or leaving their present accommodation, about the responsibilities and rates of tenants and occupation of tenancies, about home improvements, and about neighbourhood and environment schemes. Housing has become an increasingly complex subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Committee are handed documents such as the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984, the Housing Associations Act 1985 and the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987. I doubt whether a single Member of the Committee has worked his way through those three documents and knows in detail what they say about the complex subject of housing legislation in Scotland. But what is enshrined in those Acts and will be enshrined in the Bill when it becomes law is a series of serious implications for tenants in the public and private sectors, and if they are to have any genuine understanding of those implications they must be given great assistance by way of advice and facilities to find out their rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sometime matters are so complex that tenants may wish to test their rights in court. They may wish to challenge the obligations and duties of Scottish Homes, and to do that they must have access to expert advice. I know that many voluntary bodies are already working in this area, including citizens advice bureaux, Shelter the Tenants Participation Advisory Service and the housing aid centres that have sprung up on Scottish cities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present structure will not be able to cope with the number of inquiries generated by the Bill, because it makes radical changes in the rights and reponsibilities of tenants. There will not only be a change in the security of tenure at present enjoyed by tenants; under the new system there will be serious changes in assured and short assured tenancies. Tenants will be looking for advice on their rights under the new tenancies. A whole new rent regime will come into operation if tenants choose to move house, and tenants will want to seek advice on that issue, too. There will also be a new role for rent officers in checking the housing benefit to be paid to tenants in different housing circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

long. The hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn) has no need to put on a false red nose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill proposes radical changes to the rights of tenants in Scotland, not least in the right to pick a landlord, which has been described by the Scottish Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux as a "previously unheard of choice of tenure". Anyone who has attended meetings during the consultation process over the Scottish Homes document will know that tenants are worried about the new pick-a-landlord scheme. Tens of thousands of tenants will want to know about that right. Therefore, the facilities must be made available which will enable them to be fully and expertly informed of their rights not only under existing legislation but under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Scottish Homes is to be the dynamic housing agency which the Government claim and is to change the face of housing in Scotland, it must show a genuine commitment to providing tenants with advice and facilities that allow them to know what is going on and to participate. I am sure that the Minister will say that the Government will beef up the Tenants Participation Advisory Service, but Scottish Homes must take a lead, as the Government are looking to it to do in many other respects. It should establish a national tenants' advisory service which operates on a regional basis and at all levels in Scotland to provide tenants with advice and the facilities to enable them to participate genuinely and which does not restrict their rights simply to paper—to documents. Bills, dispatches and Ministers' speeches—on the ground that nothing changes. If the Government genuinely want to help tenants, they will accept the amendments, which have been suggested by the Scottish Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux. This is not a party political issue; it is concerned with giving tenants the facilities and the advice that they need to particpate. If the Government resist the amendment, the only conclusion that can be drawn is that they are not genuine in wanting to involve tenants in such decisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to respond to the hon. Gentleman. The theme of his remarks was that there should be a commitment to creating an advisory service in Scotland. I agree that that is extremely important: tenants must continue to be involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Tenants Participation Advisory Service already exists to provide independent advice to tenants. I am glad to inform the hon. Gentleman that the Scottish Development Department supports that service financially to ensure that its purpose is realised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman mentioned the worry of tenants should they wish to take up any of the options put before them. We deal fully with that in part III, but all the existing rights of present tenants will remain intact. It is important to remember that in tenants' choice it is the tenant who will select the landlord for Scottish Homes to approve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>396</span>
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Gentleman that expert advice is extremely important and I understand the proposal for a national tenants advice service. The wide nature of Scottish Homes' powers, which we discussed on a previous amendment, will enable Scottish Homes to provide such a service. It will also be able to provide assistance to services which others may wish to offer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments seek to require Scottish homes to do things which, left to its own devices, it will tackle anyway. The thrust of the White Paper is based on choice, in which tenants choose for themselves how their houses are to be managed. Scottish Homes will play a major role in this work, and I am sure that the ideas proposed in the amendments will be a useful guide to what is needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much of the work of Scottish Homes will not, however, be concerned with tenants, even indirectly. It cannot be right to lay down in the Bill a direct involvement in matters such as the assistance given to private developers or to community businesses. The Scottish Homes board will have, in the words of the White Paper,
	<br><blockquote><p>"someone able to contribute experience of the interests of tenants."</p></blockquote>
That, and the consequent emphasis on a tenant involvement which Scottish Homes will achieve, meet the spirit of the amendments. A statutory provision is unnecessary and may restrict what can be done. I hope, therefore, that the hon. Member will seek to withdraw the amendment, failing which I ask the Committee to reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are on fairly familiar territory here. The amendment seeks neither to leave Scottish Homes to its own devices, as the Minister has said it should be left, nor to sabotage the work of Scottish Homes. But it is not good enough to say that because the Minister has given us an assurance that it will operate in the way that he described, and that, left to its own devices, it will tackle these problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As Opposition Members have made clear in other debates, we want to be more specific in the direction that we give not only to statutory bodies like Scottish Homes but to Ministers who have to supervise and control. As my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) said, the Government in their White Paper make choice one the paramount purposes of the Bill. Paragraph 1.1 of the White Paper says that the Government will
	<br><blockquote><p>"encourage greater individual responsibility for, and"—</p></blockquote>
this is an extremely important word—
	<br><blockquote><p>"control over, the conditions in which people live".</p></blockquote>
It is not good enough to state that as the aim of the Bill and at the same time to refuse to place specific obligations on Scottish Homes to ensure that that is its primary purpose. If it is a good enough primary purpose for the White Paper, it is a good enough one for the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's statement that, left to its own devices, Scottish Homes will tackle this problem is not good enough. In previous sittings Opposition Members proposed the direct nomination of a tenant to sit on the board of Scottish Homes. That was rejected out of hand by the Government. We are told
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0297">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>397</span>
by the Minister that it is the Secretary of State's intention to ensure that someone is appointed who will look after tenants' interests—the appointment not of a tenant but of someone who will look after their interests. I made it clear in the debate on that amendment that that was not good enough. All Opposition Members made the same point, because we want to see direction. The same is true here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East made a number of valid points. Because of my professional training, I am concerned about the complexity of the law. While he was speaking, I ran through the terms of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987. That is a consolidation Act and we are grateful to the Government for having consolidated housing legislation, but in the table of derivations at the back of the Act we note that 48 previous statutes are encompassed, from which the terms of the Act are derived. Even for a lawyer, the legislation is complex.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most tenants will not go to the local housing department or to Scottish Homes for advice on housing legislation. They will go to a lawyer in private practice. Many will use the facilities available to them under the legal advice and assistance scheme, which is a cost to the state. Most lawyers in private practice do not know their way about this legislation, though at least they will be able to see that in the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 the law has been consolidated. They will then have to take into account the huge number of regulations that may be made under the legislation, not just those made directly under it but those that are saved by this legislation though made under earlier legislation. It is a complex and expensive area for lawyers to investigate, and assistance is needed. It is not good enough to say that Scottish Homes will provide that assistance to tenants—proper facilities must also be provided. In addition, there will be future changes to the legislation if I am right I think that this Bill is but the first of the Government's measures to amend the 1987 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984 16 specified statutes are consolidated. The same points apply there. The complexity of the legislation makes it necessary to ensure that tenants are able to get speedy and effective advice. That Act, too, will be amended by the Bill. This is a complex and complicated area and even the lawyers—I say this with hand on heart and I speak from experience—find it difficult to find their way through the minefield of legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment suggests that Scottish Homes should have the specific responsibility to
	<br><blockquote><p>"provide or assist in the provision of schemes for the participation of tenants in the exercise of its functions and powers".</p></blockquote>
We want to see tenants achieve what the Government say that they want to encourage—greater control and responsibility by tenants for the conditions in which they live. The best way to achieve that is to place the responsibility directly on the shoulders of Scottish Homes to establish schemes which will ensure that end. There does not need to be a groundswell or demand in any particular area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister and I both know that groundswell and demands are usually generated by problems. We want to pre-empt the problems and ensure that
	<span class='label label-info column'>398</span>
tenants achieve the Government's objectives, which we share, of greater responsibility and control by tenants over their own living conditions. We do not want to see tenants' organisations created to deal with particular problems such as dampness, lack of repairs or some other problem that we cannot as yet predict. We want a co-ordinated scheme with encouragement by Scottish Homes at gound level if it is to have this huge responsibility, because there are spin-offs for both sides. Tenants' organisations will have the full participation and confidence of the tenants involved. There will also be spin-offs for Scottish Homes, which will have the benefit of direct contact with tenants through those organisations and feedback about what is happening in certain areas more quickly than with disparate, unco-ordinated attempts to create tenant's organisations. A large number of benefits will ensue if the Government accept the amendments and there is a co-ordinated scheme for tenants' organisations throughout the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to stress as we did in earlier discussions, that it is for the Government to pursue excellence in all matters. We want the highest possible standards in the public sector. We want to see that spread not only to the provision and quality of housing, but to the terms and conditions on which the houses are let, and to areas of consultation and consideration of the rights and interests of tenants. For all those reasons, I support the amendments of my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Galloway 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Hillhead)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I must express my genuine regret and apology that, having been to the fore in lashing the hon.

I do not know whether I shall die wondering what his voice sounds like and what pearls of wisdom he imparted to the Committee. I can only express the earnest hope that he will speak again before the end of the proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister said that Scottish Homes, if left to its own devices, would do as the amendments sought, there was a band playing somewhere in the distance "Believe it if you like". The Minister cannot seriously expect us to believe that Scottish Homes, as it is beginning to emerge, will be anything like the kind of organisation that will take seriously the ideas encompassed in the amendments. We are getting a picture—heaven knows, we have spent enough hours trying to tease that picture out—of an organisation which will operate in secret. In the middle of the night, when the newspapers had gone to bed, our attempts to make Scottish Homes subject to the access to information and the provisions of the 1987 Act—so that people who live in its houses, work for it or are interested in housing can get access to the way in which Scottish Homes operates and the policies that it pursues—were voted down by the Conservative lobby fodder. They were not present to hear the debates, but they were here to vote down our amendments. We are dealing with a secret organisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman can ask that question outside. The Committee is discussing amendment No. 131.

That seems a good reason to leave the Committee for five minutes, and it is certainly not comparable with the absence of Conservative Members from our proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred to the previous debate because the picture that is emerging of Scottish Homes is not of an organisation which, left to its own devices, is likely to do the kind of things that our amendments seek to encourage. We have established that Scottish Homes will operate in secret and that the members of the board will not be required to have proven expertise or interest in housing. The board members will not have to have any connection with Scotland—they will not have to live there or even have a house there. The board will be unencumbered by any legislative requirement to tackle problems such as dampness. It will not have to carry out a house condition survey. The nine members of the board will not have to be representative in any way. We therefore have a clear picture of the organisation and the people who will run it. They are not likely to encourage tenants' organisations to begin to take some control of their own lives, as the hypocritical prattle of the White Paper suggests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to say again as I did previously, although the same jibes will doubtless be made today, that the Labour Party has much to live down in this connection. It has long been a central tenet of the newly resurgent and hegemonic Right-wing element in the Conservative party, most eloquently represented by the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth), that Labour is the party of the state as nanny, or the state as matron—being mostly public school boys, they tend to use that sort of language—and that in both local and national government Labour acts as Big Brother. It used to be said that tenants on the big estates were Labour voting fodder, ministered to by Socialists in white jackets in town halls. That was a caricature, but there was truth in it in relation to Labour public policy on housing matters in the past. Tenants in the big estates were not given enough power or control over their own lives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An Englishman's home may be his castle, but even in Scotland a home is of central importance to every man or woman. The street, garden, path, lighting or
	<span class='label label-info column'>400</span>
play facilities that people have are of central importance in their lives. Not enough attention has been given by Labour Governments or Councils in the past to setting tenants free to decide the colour of the doors or windowsills, where the play parks should be and the many other matters that are so important to their happiness and the quality of their lives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much of the criticism that was traditionally levelled at the Labour party by the libertarian wing of the Conservative party contained a considerable degree of truth. Yet I am sure that we shall be told again by the Minister that our amendment requiring Scottish Homes to set up machinery to apply energy and resources to allow tenants to organise themselves to begin to redress the problems caused by public policy throughout the 1960s and 1970s is unnecessary, because the board of Scottish Homes, left to its own devices, will do what is required anyway. I simply do not believe that, and no one who has read the debates and decisions of the Committee so far will believe it either.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tenants' organisations will be set up irrespective of whether Scottish Homes encourages it, but unless we approach it systematically and from the centre, as my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) said, they will not be tenants' organisations born in the constructive, positive spirit that is in the best interests of Scottish Homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that many Conservative Members hate trade unions and have spent a long time trying to destroy them. But industrialists of any size of enterprise and captains of industry prefer to have their organisations trade-unionised. They prefer to be able to deal with the convenor of shop stewards or the trade union official to make the sorts of arrangements that are necessary for co-existing together as employers and employees, without which factories could not run. Many enterprises could not run if the work force was not organised and did not appoint spokespeople to deal authentically with the employer on its behalf. Hon. Gentlemen should ask any captain of industry whether he would rather go round line by line, department by department, in his enterprise, negotiating separately with discontented, disaffected groups of workers—because that always happens—and he will say that he prefers to deal with a properly structured and organised trade union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that that analogy is applicable here. It would be better for Scottish Homes at its birth to say that it has a clear commitment to tenant organisation, tenant choice and tenant power, and intends to do everything that it can to create the machinery necessary for such dialogue to take place on a properly structured basis. If not, tenants' organisations will be born out of trouble and crisis, over a problem of dampness here, of poor lighting there, and of housing allocation policy somewhere else, and there will be a dog's breakfast of arrangements that will not be in the interests of the tenants or of Scottish Homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government are serious in the propaganda that lay behind the Bill and they genuinely want authority, whether local, national or Scottish special, off the backs of tenants and they genuinely want to set tenants free, they should provide the wherewithal
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0299">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>401</span>
to be free and make informed, organised choice by accepting the amendments .</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment, if not perhaps some of the harder-line arguments that have been a feature of the speeches today. That is not intended as an attack. I have my own reasons for supporting not just the spirit but the technical wording of the amendment, because it could easily be inserted into the Bill as it stands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that it is possible for Scottish Homes to operate in the way that the Government hope that it will operate unless there is explicit provision for such assistance. We cannot expect tenants, left to their own devices and with a completely new regime inflicted upon them, to play the constructive role that I think the Government are seeking to elicit from them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I subscribe wholeheartedly to the view of the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) about the complexity of the housing statutes. I have some passing acquaintance in a previous incarnation with those statutes and they are an acquired taste, to put it mildly. Getting people to contribute and participate actively—the success of Scottish Homes will depend, in my view, on tenants participating actively—cannot be expected to happen overnight by itself; there should at least be some provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That provision can be made in several different ways. Full-time staff should be allocated the specific task of going out to support tenants' committees by providing resources and professional advice, making them aware of their rights, suggesting how to set up constitutions and the basic framework of meetings so that the tenants' organisations may be properly set up, organised and resourced. That need not be a large commitment. If they were chosen properly and had the right skills and experience, and if they did nothing else, one or two professional staff in each area could make a significant difference to the way in which tenants could be drawn in and involved in the day-to-day organisation of their accommodation. That is a fundamentally important part of the Bill, and the amendment is the best way of bringing about that change. There must be a specific explicit duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On earlier amendments, I have been prepared to accept expressions of interest and intent from the Government, although some may say that it is optimistic to do so. But this is a good amendment and we need something firm from the Government—not merely an expression of intent but a willingness to take on board, if not the amendment itself, another amendment that will give a positive, explicit duty to Scottish Homes to support tenant's organisations and make them function in the way that they should if Scottish Homes is to become the success that the Government are expecting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) spoke about 48 previous statutes all being embodied in the consolidation statute. That is right. There is a considerable number, and the problem that many people have is finding which provision applies to which set of circumstances. He will know that even if lawyers do not know the law they know where to look
	<span class='label label-info column'>402</span>
it up. I assure the hon. Gentleman that Scottish Homes has the power to cover the circumstances envisaged in amendment No. 131 and, I believe, certainly will. The Housing Corporation advises housing associations regularly and fully through its guidance notes, and I have no doubt that Scottish Homes will have a similar guidance to cover its wider powers and new relationships. Scottish Homes will do for tenants what the amendment seeks. In those circumstances, I ask the Opposition not to press the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under clause 2(9) the Secretary of State has powers to make directions, and if there was any evidence that the advice service was inadequate, he would have the power to take immediate action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly will not withdraw the amendment. In the absence of any explicit provision in the Bill for Scottish Homes to accept those responsibilities, the Government's commitment to tenant participation can only be described as a sham. For the Minister to say that Scottish Homes has the power to cover what is included in amendment No. 131 and that he thinks that it will is not good enough, and he should know that it is not good enough. As my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galloway) said, the Minister may be the Minister responsible for housing in Scotland now, but there is no guarantee that he will be by the time Scottish Homes comes into being.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What kind of organisation will Scottish Homes be? Not only will it be a secret organisation, appointed solely by the Government and, therefore, in line with the health boards in Scotland, more than likely to be Tory-dominated, but it will be an organisation that is likely to carry out the instructions not of the Minister, but of his mistress at No. 10 Downing Street. That means that there will be no commitment to the specific responsibility that we seek to place on Scottish Homes to set up a national advisory service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not good enough for the Minister to think that Scottish Homes will set up such a service; we want it to set it up and we want the Bill to ensure that it does. The same is true of facilities to allow genuine tenant participation in the decisions that will affect them. I think that the Minister said that Scottish Homes would not be concerned directly with tenants. Why is it taking over 83,000 SSHA houses? Those tenants will be directly affected by Scottish Homes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The words that I used were that much of the work of Scottish Homes will not be concerned with tenants, even indirectly, and I mentioned the examples that I had in mind—for instance, work with community businesses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister misses the point entirely. Scottish Homes will be making decisions about rents, rehabilitation programmes and repair services which will affect up to 100,000 tenants, and the Minister is saying that we should not give Scottish Homes any statutory responsibility to allow those tenants to participate in those decisions or to seek advice from a national advisory service about their
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0300">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>403</span>
rights in respect of them. As with all the other changes that are being introduced, the Minister is deliberately keeping Scottish Homes free of any housing responsibility. He is giving it a free hand to act like buccaneers in Scottish housing—to go where it can make money for itself and the private sector developers who will work with it. The Government are not interested in tenants or in tackling the housing crisis. We are ready to divide the Committee on the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall move the amendment briefly, indeed almost formally, to give the Minister an opportunity to explain the circumstances in which Scottish Homes would have the power of compulsory purchase.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I simply want to ask the Minister a question and to seek his advice on a matter which is not directly related to compulsory purchase but which is related to the provisions of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will know of the anomaly caused by the charges levied by the SSHA on owner-occupiers who have purchased their houses from the SSHA in respect of amenity grant for Schemes in which the SSHA plots are situated. The Bill is an appropriate vehicle for tidying up that anomaly, which affects hundreds of former SSHA tenants in my constituency who are now owner-occupiers. I am sure that it applies in other places in the south and south-west of Scotland as well as in the south-east and perhaps even more widely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may say that that is not the appropriate way in which to raise the matter. It may be possible to deal with it in another part of the Bill. I am minded to introduce a new clause. The Bill should tidy up that anomaly. Scottish Homes will acquire these parcels of amenity ground that are related to former tenancies. The amenity charges are increasing by leaps and bounds year by year in an unsatisfactory way. The SSHA does not like it, nor do the local authorities. There is a great deal of anxiety and frustration in the minds of owner-occupiers who are
	<span class='label label-info column'>404</span>
left with the residue that no one wants nor knows what to do with. I should like guidance about the general functions of Scottish Homes and how the Government propose to deal with them. I apologise if this is not the most appropriate way to raise the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As that problem does not spring directly from this group of amendments, I would say to the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire that the charges are agreed by the purchasing tenant in the missives which he or she agrees on purchase. Private developers often use the same practice. That is the present position. If the hon. Gentleman tables a new clause, we may discuss the matter later; that is the appropriate way to deal with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments examine another well-precedented power which the Bill will provide for Scottish Homes. The hon. Member for East Lothian wanted to know about compulsory purchase. It is a necessary tool for anyone who operates in land. The Housing Corporation and the SDA have such powers and have used them from time to time. The SSHA has not such powers. A common use is in the assembly of sensible groups of houses for rehabilitation. The Housing Corporation uses compulsory purchase to assist housing associations working in tenements to resolve title deed problems and to take over abandoned houses. It is relatively seldom that there is opposition to these purchases, but where no seller can be found, compulsory purchase is the only alternative. Similar problems occur in the asembly of packages of land; the SDA operates in a broadly similar way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All compulsory purchase orders promoted by such bodies and Scottish Homes will be subject to the confirmation of the Secretary of State with the usual procedures of public inquiry being available if needed. Local authority powers are not affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 88 would require Scottish Homes to obtain the approval of a relevant local authority as well as the confirmation given by the Secretary of State. In the circumstances that I have described, it would not be necessary, but would be a bureaucratic control to which similar bodies are not subject. I am sure that where Scottish Homes thought that a larger compulsory purchase was necessary, it would not embark on the long legal procedures involved without agreeing the shape of its proposals with the local authority; not to do so would run the risk of challenge and delay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 89 would omit the power entirely. This would lead to severe difficulties for registered housing associations pursuing the major tenement rehabilitation programmes of our cities and large towns. It might also leave unattractive land with title difficulties lying next to new housing which housing associations or Scottish Homes had provided to the detriment of the new housing area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The standard controls have proved themselves more than adequate, and I see no need to accept amendment No. 88. As the function is vital, I cannot agree to amendment No. 89. I urge the hon. Member to withdraw the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0301">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>405</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the Minister would do so. He said that he was not happy about amendment No. 88, because it would apply a bureaucratic control. If he read the amendment, he would understand that we are seeking a democratic control over a bureaucracy. There is legitimate anxiety among many citizens about the possible capricious use of powers of compulsory purchase. Unfortunately, recent experience in the Scottish Office has tended to confirm anxiety about the way in which the present incumbent exercises any discretion that he may have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point has been well made, however, and we may return to it in due course. I now beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 90, in page 2, line 37, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'except that Scottish Homes shall not enter arrangements with a Community Charge levying authority under paragraph 5 of Schedule 2 to the Abolition of Domestic Rates Etc. (Scotland) Act 1987'.</p></blockquote>
This is potentially an interesting debate which could take us into the intriguing realms of the poll tax legislation and the way in which it is operated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 9 of schedule 2 of the so-called Abolition of Domestic Rates Etc. (Scotland) Act 1987 provides for "arrangements with housing bodies" under the poll tax legislation. It provides for poll tax authorities to make arrangements for housing bodies to act as agents for them in the collection of the poll tax. We discussed that during our consideration of that notorious legislation. The present Bill, when enacted, will offer scope for the further extension of that power and for Scottish Homes to act as an agent for the poll tax authority, so we are entitled to raise the subject with the Government again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 5 of schedule 2 to the poll tax Act deals with arrangements with housing bodies. It states that arrangements may be made to—
	<br><blockquote><p>"provide for the receipt, collection or recovery by the housing body of any amount for which a person is liable under section 18(3)"—</p></blockquote>
in other words, it provides for the collection of the poll tax, and goes on to say that the arrangements may—
	<br><blockquote><p>"in relation to the functions to be exercised by the housing body, provide that appeals"—</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Lambie. I am not aware that there is any such thing as a poll tax Act. When the hon. Gentleman refers to Acts that are on the statute book he must make sure that they are indeed on the statute book. Otherwise, the Committee and the Chair are liable to be misled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that is a point of order. The Chair cannot advise any hon. Member how to make his speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) is wonderfully sensitive this morning. Opposition Members prefer to call a spade a spade. Frankly, a poll tax is a poll tax, however the Government or anyone else may describe it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>406</span>
I have already pointed out that a housing body can be required to act as an agent for the poll tax authorities in the collection or recovery of poll tax. It will be required to deal with appeals under paragraph 4(3)(a), and it can be required to set up terms by which instalments can be paid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Lambie. I understand that when Acts of Parliament are cited in Committee other hon. Members are entitled to ask that they be made available so that we may verify what is said. When may I, as a Member of the Committee, have access to an Act of which I have never heard?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman puts in an order to the Chair, I will see that the appropriate legislation is placed on the Table as soon as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Member for Tayside, North will be grateful for that. He was a member of the Standing Committee which considered that measure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no such Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I prefaced my remarks by using the full short title of the Act—the Abolition of Domestic Rates Etc. (Scotland) Act 1987. It would be tedious to go through that rigmarole every time. Everyone else in Scotland refers to it as the poll tax Act, and that is what it is. If the hon. Member for Tayside, North does not know what we are talking about, that is his problem and not ours. [Hon. Members: "He voted for it."]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 5(5) of schedule 2 to that Act states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Arrangements under sub-paragraph (1) above shall be on such terms as may be agreed between the levying authority and the housing body or, failing agreement, as may be determined by the Secretary of State."</p></blockquote>
Again, there is power of direction by the Secretary of State on the agency arrangements relating to housing authorities for the collection of the poll tax in Scotland. Subsection (6) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where the Secretary of State is satisfied that a levying authority wish to make arrangement under sub-paragraph (1) above with a housing body but the housing body have not agreed to enter into them, he may, by regulations made after consultation with the levying authority and the housing body, require the housing body to do so."</p></blockquote>
Those are the Secretary of State's powers in relation to the implementation of the poll tax legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several district councils in Scotland—elected district councils, to their credit—have rightly decided that they want no part of the squalid and oppressive exercise of administering a poll tax in Scotland, a tax which is designed to redistribute wealth from the poor to the rich.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer in passing to the related provisions of the Abolition of Domestic Rates Etc. (Scotland) Act 1987—I give the full title for the benefit of the hon. Member for Tayside, North—which impose a system of spying, snooping and clyping for the purposes of compiling the poll tax register. I refer specifically to section 17, which deals with duties in relation to registration. Subsection (3) states:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0302">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>407</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Subject to subsection (4) below, the registration officer may require … any housing body in his registration area, to supply him with such information as he may reasonably require in connection with his functions, being information which the … housing body have in connection with any of their functions; and the … housing body shall comply with such a requirement."</p></blockquote>
Again, we find powers to require housing bodies to furnish information to poll tax authorities. That could include the divulging of information about tenancies, tenants, rent payments, records of correspondence and interviews with tenants which could help to establish the number of people in the house and their identity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final reference to the 1987 Act is to section 26, which defines "housing body" for the purposes of the poll tax Act as a district council, the Scottish Special Housing Association and new town development corporations. Therefore, it seems likely that, as the SSHA is to be incorporated into Scottish Homes under the Bill, Scottish Homes could be required by the Government to assume those inappropriate and potentially sinister powers and duties in relation to the registration and collection of poll tax in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This debate gives the Minister an opportunity to report to the Committee on progress in the massive bureaucratic task of setting up the poll tax machinery in Scotland. There have recently been signs of the difficulties which the Opposition predicted and intend to aggravate and exploit as far as we can, together with our comrades and friends, of all political persuasions and none, in Scotland. I suspect that it is unlikely that the Government will be able to impose the poll tax by their target date in 1989. Clearly their operations to collect information and set up the machinery for collection in relation to Scottish Homes must form part of this debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister tell us what role the Government have in mind for Scottish Homes in the procedure of registration and collection for poll tax? Several local authorities in Scotland, including East Lothian district council in my own constituency, have already said that they will not willingly co-operate with the poll tax machinery. Indeed, they are likely to to the absolute minimum within the law to assist the poll tax officials in Scotland, and they are right to do so. I am sure that we shall look for all manner of devices to frustrate the Government's iniquitous intentions in relation to the poll tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But district councils at least have some freedom to manoeuvre within the law. Scottish Homes, as a quango and a creature of the Secretary of State for Scotland, to use the terminology which the the hon. Member for Stirling likes to use in relation to health boards, will have no such freedom. It will be appointed by the Secretary of State for Scotland and it will be responsible to and under the direction of the Secretary of State for Scotland. We are considering in the Bill a new landlord with 83,000 tenants that it will inherit from the Scottish Special Housing Association, with a substantial number of tenants in housing association houses who will fall within the ambit of Scottish Homes, and with the possibility of a takeover of local authority houses in the future in line with the Government's policies for centralising control of public sector housing in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>408</span>
Scottish Homes also has access to a range of records in relation to private housing in Scotland, since it will be involved in paying improvement and repair grants to owner-occupiers and in detailed relationships with private landlords within the framework of private tenancies in Scotland. Scottish Homes will, therefore, be the ultimate national housing body for Scotland, able to lay its hands on a great deal of information about people and their households.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scottish Homes could have unprecedented scope to collect and collate information about all types of households in Scotland and to collaborate with the poll tax registration and levying authorities. We are dealing with one of the more unsavoury aspects of the poll tax legislation, or the Abolition of Domestic Rates, Etc. (Scotland) Act 1987, if the hon. Member for Tayside, North insists—an aspect that could require housing professionals to act as informers about the tenants for whom they are responsible and their families. Obviously, from time to time professionals dealing with complaints about housing or applications for transfers will have to make records of how many people there are in each household and what age they are, and that information will be of considerable interest to the poll tax authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fear that the framework of the Bill is intended to be a breach of the basic principles of confidentiality and privacy. One can envisage an 18-year-old youngster resident in a household who will not willingly ensure that he has his poll tax collected, but whose parents may want to claim a home improvement grant or apply for a transfer to another house or complain to their landlord about condensation or other difficulties. A tenant might be reluctant to report such problems to the local authority landlords for fear that information about the presence of that 18-year-old would percolate through the system of informers to the poll tax office. One can envisage many circumstances in which friction could be caused in people's households and where totally irrelevant considerations could come into housing management decisions. It is an invidious and improper position in which to place housing professionals, and I strongly believe that housing management should be kept entirely separate from the administration of personal taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the face of the poll tax Act, there is scope to require local authorities, the SSHA and new town development corporations to do the poll tax officials' dirty work for them. That was a dangerous breach of principles that should be protected by Parliament, if Parliament was doing its job properly in relation to Scotland. I fear that the growth of Scottish Homes into something far bigger than the Scottish Special Housing Association could have sinister implications. I hope that the Minister will take this opportunity to say a word about the progress—or, it is to be hoped, the lack of progress—of the implementation of that demented legislation. Perhaps he will also answer the serious questions, that I have asked in relation to the dealings between Scottish Homes, in its capacity as a landlord and a body responsible for other aspects of housing policy, and households in Scotland, because it is disturbing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will give way in a minute. We may then have an opportunity to study the amendments that are tabled and relate them to Acts that exist instead of to fiction, fantasy and fairy tales. The Committee has been treated to a ramble into fairy tales which were not relevant, although after I had drawn the hon. Gentleman's attention to the fact that the Act to which he referred did not exist, he then drew the Committee's attention to one that does exist.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a truly wonderful exercise in pedantry. By the hon. Gentleman's own analysis, he is talking about an hon. Member who does not exist, because he referred to the hon. Member for East Lothian as the hon. Member for Berwick and East Lothian; that consituency has not existed since 1983.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am well aware that the hon. Gentleman does not exist in the world of sanity, reality and fact. The hon. Gentleman lives in a fairytale world of his own, inhabited by creatures that few of us recognise,</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>410</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The people of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman often describes them as homo sapiens, but when one studies them carefully, one realises that they belong to books of fiction rather than fact.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is keen on referring to fairy tales. The most appropriate fairy tale to call to mind is "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs". Snow White is the leader. Which of the seven dwarfs does the hon. Member think that he represents?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The happy one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Grumpy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Dopey.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is more than I can say for the dismal Jimmies, the miseries and the other dwarfs on the Opposition Benches who represent the Grumpies of this world. They are always complaining, greeting and gurning. Anyone who considers carefully amendment No. 90 will realise that it refers to an Act that is on the statute book. The hon. Gentleman who leads for the Opposition said clearly that I was a member of the Committee that considered the legislation and put the Act on to the statute book. I am not ashamed of the work that I have done in Committees. You and I, Mr. Lambie, may have had our differences, but neither of us has ever suggested that the other did not do his work, although we may have disagreed about how the work was done. But we have always agreed that both of us worked.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is one of the few Tory survivors from that Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not ashamed that I was a member of the Committee that considered the Abolition of Domestic Rates Etc. (Scotland) Bill that is now on the statute book. That is the Act to which we should refer. The hon. Member for East Lothian should have referred to it in his speech. He kept wandering into the fairy-tale world of fiction, referring to an Act that does not exist. He even cited the sections of an Act that does not exist. How does he expect the Committee to arrive at any decisions when he refers to non-existent matters?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Honourable Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Come on, James!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will reply very briefly.

This amendment seeks to prevent Scottish Homes from collecting community charge, on behalf of a regional council, from its tenants and there families. This function is no different from that carried out at present by the SSHA and local housing authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
