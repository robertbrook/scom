<br><br><!-- lb --> OF RENT (SCOTLAND) ACT 1984</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed (18 February):</i> No. 468, in page 22, leave out lines 15 to 42.—[	<i>Mr. Kirkwood.</i>]</p>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are taking amendment No. 476, in page 22, line 26, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(c) there are at no time more than two occupiers in addition to the owner or a member of his family".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) asked a number of questions during his speech and, although they did not relate particularly to the amendments, I wish to go through the answers one by one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Gentleman's first question asked about the effect of new section 23A in the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984. Because the new section begins:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Nothing in this Part of this Act applies to a tenancy or right of occupancy if</p></blockquote>
the conditions set out apply, it disapplies sections 23 and 24 of the 1984 Act from excluded tenancies, as defined by new section 23A.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Gentleman's second question related to rateable values. The references to rateable values in part VII of the 1984 Act either are left alone, if they refer to rateable value at some specified date, or are repealed entirely by schedule 10 to the Bill. However, that will not take effect until 1 April 1989, when the abolition of Domestic Rates (Scotland) Act 1987 comes into effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the honourable Gentleman asked whether subsection (2) of new section 23A was correct. He is right: it is not. It contains two errors, which will be corrected by the next group of amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my concluding remarks last Thursday I pointed out an apparent anomaly, in that certain occupiers with assured tenancies would appear to be excluded
	<span class='label label-info column'>874</span>
from the protection of part III of the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984. I was grateful to Shelter for bringing that anomaly to our attention and I shall consider how best to deal with it. I said then that my inclination was to restrict the exclusion to occupiers with resident landlords who share accommodation with the landlord or one of his family, but I wish to give the matter further consideration and thought.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has had since Thursday night to give that matter some thought. Indeed, he said then that he had taken on board Shelter's representations about the disturbing fact that one category of tenant would be excluded from the existing basic protections against harassment and unlawful eviction, in spite of what he had said earlier. Can the Minister say whether the Government intend to amend this apparently unforeseen aspect of the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I should like to give it further thought to see what the wording should be. I hope that the honourable Gentleman will accept that undertaking in the spirit in which it is given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to amendment No. 476, the Committee will remember that when we are discussing resident landlords in the context of schedule 4, I agreed to consider whether a limit should be set on the number of tenants that a resident landlord could have if his tenancies were to be exempted from being assured tenancies. Amendment No. 476 seems to raise similar issues, although some of the considerations will be slightly different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am certain that a restriction to only two tenants would set the number too low. Therefore, if the honourable Gentleman will permit me, I shall look again at the question raised by amendment No. 476, together with schedule 4. In the light of that undertaking, I hope that the honourable Gentleman will seek to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that the honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) is with us at the minute. He has just been urged to seek to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, it is the amendment of the honourable Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that, not for the first time in the Committee, the Minister is wrong. The amendment was moved by the honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire last Thursday night. He went into the points raised by a number of organisations, in particular Shelter and, I think, the Scottish Council for the Single Homeless, which are understandably anxious about the fact that a category of extremely vulnerable tenants who reside in the same property as their landlords are likely to lose their basic protection against harassment and pre-emptory conviction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0560">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>875</span>
I was encouraged to hear from the Minister that that was not the Government's intention and that he was prepared to reconsider the point. He said that the Government intended to move amendments to the Bill to overcome the problem and to ensure that these vulnerable tenants in that type of property would retain at least the existing degree of protection that they enjoy, if that is the right verb to use. It would be helpful if he would say whether he intends to introduce such amendments in the House or leave them until a later date. If the Government intend to amend the Bill to deal with the problem on Report, in addition to all the other problems with which they hope to deal, I am inclined to advise the honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire to seek to withdraw the amendment on that clear understanding. It is not yet clear enough; no doubt the honourable member will want to respond.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely subscribe to what has been said by the honourable Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson). I would like some guidance about the timescale. It is not a massive technical problem. It could be resolved with a little application before Report. I hope that we shall have more than one day on Report. I make no complaint about the way in which the Committee is proceeding, because the Government are considering some of the points that have been raised, but this is clearly a classic omission that Committee stages are designed to determine and correct. Shelter has perfectly properly been given credit for discovering the anomaly. I do not see that it is a difficult thing to do. If a couple of Scottish Office lawyers spent a morning on it, they could come up with something. It would not be right to start thinking about introducing amendments in the other place. The Committee needs some guidance about the timescale of some of these amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of them involve elements of policy-making decisions. That requires consultation, because there may be implications for other parts of the Bill. But that is not so with this amendment; it is a straightforward anomaly. We need technical wording. It should not take any time. The Minister should press his advisers and lawyers to get on with it in time for a proper discussion on Report. It is an important amendment to the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having made that point, I cannot seek to drag any more information out of the Minister. I accept that the point has been fully discussed. We all know what we are talking about and what needs to be done. The technical work now needs to be carried out. I am happy to seek to withdraw the amendment on that basis. But I should rest easier in my bed tonight if the Minister would give us some guidance about the timescale.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the honourable Gentleman that it will be a long time before he gets anywhere near his bed tonight. We are in for a long, complicated, Report stage, which illustrates the fact that the Government did a sloppy job in preparing the Bill. The consultation period was absurdly slow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>876</span>
That is why we have this ever-lengthening list of amendments and undertakings to introduce amendments on Report. It shows that the Government have approached the Bill back to front. If they had consulted properly, we should not be getting bogged down. I hope that the Minister will give the undertaking that we shall be able to deal with the matter on Report. We shall probably need a longer Report stage because the consideration of the Bill on Report will be concerned with a mass of minutiae which would have been better dealt with in the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to add to the Minister's problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why not indeed? Shelter is asking the Government to clarify their interpretation of the clause before we drop amendments and move on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Shelter is saying that section 3 of the current Rent Act gives protection against harassment here and illegal eviction without due process of law, and section 22 deals mainly with harassment. Section 23 prohibits eviction without due process of law from tenancies that are not statutorily protected or are not part VII contracts. Would the effect of inserting clause 37 after section 23 of the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984 be to disapply prohibition of eviction without due process of law as to current occupiers when there is a resident landlord only where there is no part VII contract; that is, only when the occupier does not have exclusive occupation of his or her bedroom? If that is the case, the result would be immediately to remove protection from eviction without due process of law from those resident landlords who also have to share their sleeping accommodation with others. That would be unfortunate, since this is the most vulnerable group of occupiers, those who are likely to have landlords with many tenants, and they are the ones whom the Government claim that they have previously voiced concern about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the same time, tenants with exclusive occupation of part of the house—those tenants with their own bedrooms—are the ones who are most likely to be accommodated by landlords who are taking in only one or two lodgers and they are the group that the Government wish to see having more freedom over their own homes. That is the group also for the time being of people who are part VII contract holders and will retain protection from eviction without due process of law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Shelter wants the Government to clarify whether they intend further to disadvantage the most vulnerable group compared with those who are not quite so disadvantaged because they have their own bedrooms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The effect of the clause will be that, whether a person is a tenant or not, the provisions of sections 23 or 24 of the Rent (Scotland) Act do not apply if the tenant is living with a resident landlord. The effect of disapplying those
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0561">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>877</span>
sections is that the resident landlord does not need a court order to remove him or her. The honourable Gentleman's original interpretation was therefore correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Rent legislation is extremely complex and it is important to get it right. I was asked about Report, and we will do our best. I can give the commitment that my offer remains to consider the issue of the number of tenants a resident landlord may have if he is to be exempt under clause 37. Amendment No. 468, in the name of the honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, was to delete a large part of the clause, and I cannot accept it in those terms. Amendment No. 476 was in the name of the honourable Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) and not the honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire. But I have made the position quite clear that we intend to look at the numbers again. I hope on that basis that the amendment will be withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Minister. It has been such a long time since last Thursday that I forgot in my earlier remarks to ask him about the implication and impact of the clause on agricultural tenancies, if any. I was not able to make the link myself, and I believe that I said at the last sitting that I could not understand the relationship of the clause to agricultural tenancies under the 1947 legislation. There may be none and I am perhaps raising queries where none need be raised. I want to know what effect, if any, it will have on people in agricultural tenancies because in my own constituency—and I suspect in other constituencies—if there were to be significant changes I would not want them buried in the Act and not given some measure of discussion in the Committee stage. If there are to be even slight changes to those agricultural tenancies—the Minister will know that the poll tax will have quite an impact on some of those tenancies—the Committee should know about them now in order to have a proper discussion and consider amendments for a later stage. I may be wrong and there may be no need to worry, but perhaps the Minister could tell us about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refer the honourable Gentleman to Section 24(2) and (3) of the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984. These are special provisions with respect to agricultural employees. Subsection (2) relates to the occupier, the tenant and the widow or widower. Subsection (3) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Without prejudice to any powers of the court apart from this section to postpone the operation or suspend the execution of a decree of removing or warrant of ejection or other like order (in this section referred to as an order for possession), if in proceedings by the owner against the occupier the court makes an order for the possession of the premises the court may suspend the execution of the order on such terms and conditions, including conditions as to the payment by the occupier of arrears of rent, compensation to the owner for loss of possession and otherwise as the court thinks reasonable."</p></blockquote>
Section 24 deals with agricultural tenancies and, as I understand it, the provision referred to removes the discretion of the court to suspend hearings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>878</span>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does not really. I shall raise the matter again on clause stand part. I am concerned that there will be implications for agricultural tenancies which should not be overlooked. If there are changes to the present situation that will have an impact on people in my constituency who are currently in agricultural tenancies, I need to know about that. It may be that this is not the best time to raise the matter but I do not understand what effect, if any, the Bill will have when it is implemented on people who are in agricultural tenancies now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Hamilton-Douglas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Section 24 deals with agricultural tenancies and removes the discretion of the court to suspend hearings. If the honourable Member wants further information, I suggest that he writes to me, so that we can explain it in greater detail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is supposed to be a Standing Committee dealing with detailed legislation about housing in Scotland. The Minister does not seem to have a grasp of the clause. I am grateful to the honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire for representing the interests of the agricultural industry because I am also involved with that. However, both he and the Minister have referred to agricultural tenancies but we are really discussing the tenure of tied cottages on farms and that is an important distinction. An agricultural tenancy is between a tenant farmer and his landlord whereas the tenure of a tied cottage is the tenancy of a house by a worker who has precious little security as I have mentioned previously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 24(3) of the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984 provides some discretion which enables a sheriff to suspend proceedings to evict the occupier of a tied house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We covered the same ground on schedule 5 when we argued about whether the sheriff should have discretion to exercise judgment and delay the execution of an order for possession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I first read clause 37 I saw the reference to section 24 of the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984 in the sideline, but I saw no direct reference to it in the text. I was therefore as baffled as everyone else; and the Minister has not yet made clear how section 24 of that Act will be amended by clause 37. He has, nevertheless, implied that it is the Government's intention to do so. It would appear that rolled up into the clause which undermines either deliberately or accidentally the security of tenants in accommodation shared with a landlord is a provision that will take away the sheriffs discretion to delay a possession order on a house on a farm. That need not be only an employee on a farm. The widow or family of an employee could find themselves deprived of even the most elementary protection to delay the eviction proceedings until they had alternative accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said before on the general point of tied cottages and agriculture, it is an absurd anachronism that in Scotland we still have an agricultural tied housing
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0562">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>879</span>
system. As has demonstrated in England and Wales, there are better ways of overcoming the special problems of the farming industry. Agricultural tied cottages are a particularly harrowing problem in Scotland. I do not want to overstate the case, but every year in my constituency, cases are brought to my attention where a farm worker, or the family of a farm worker, are evicted after court proceedings. There are other ways of dealing with that problem. In a modern agricultural industry it is often not necessary for a farmer to have an employee actually living on the spot. I am worried that the honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire may have stumbled on an aspect of the Bill which makes the postition of farm workers and their families in Scotland even worse than it is already and heaven knows, it is bad enouth at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now that the Minister has had a few moments to gather his thoughts on this point, perhaps he could tell us more about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The powers of the court contained in section 24 of the 1984 Act will be disapplied to agricultural tenants who share some accommodation with the landlord or a member of his family.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: "Some" accommodation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Dougals-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right. That is the position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for East Lothian also asked how the new section 23A brings in section 24. Section 24 is in part III, in which new section 23A is being inserted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I almost wish I had never started this—the more I go into it the less I like it. This is a crazy way to legislate. Disapplying sections in previous Acts makes the reading of Acts standing on their own impossibly difficult. It must have been possible to take out sections of the 1984 Act completely, even at the expense of having an extra clause in the Bill dealing with points such as this. It covers and smothers the clarity of the provisions in the Bill in layers and sub-layers of repeals and previous Acts and makes the comprehension of statutes very difficult.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman makes a fair point. I suspect that this aspect of the Bill is not only obscure but irrelevant. I cannot imagine any circumstances in Scotland at present where there is likely to be an agricultural employee sharing the same house as the employer, unless we are talking about bothies incorporated into a farmhouse. They may have been common in Victorian times—to which the Government would like us to return—but I am not aware of any such premises functioning at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable for East Lothian takes the point out of my mouth. I have already made the point about this being an untidy way to legislate,
	<span class='label label-info column'>880</span>
making the law difficult to comprehend. I cannot understand why it is necessary to legislate for a situation where the people to whom the clause would apply actually share accommodation in an agricultural context. Can the Minister give the Committee any examples, arising from his experience, of where the provision would even begin to apply? Also, can he confirm the point clearly put in the remarks of the honourable Member for East Lothian when he asked whether this reduced the discretion of the sheriff in the potential eviction of the people to whom the provisions apply? It seems clear that that is so. If that is true, I should like to have it confirmed and put in the record so that we can be clear, without any doubt, about the effect of the clause. May we have some examples and may we have confirmation that, as the honourable Member for East Lothian said, this is a further reduction in some tenants' rights?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To the best of my knowledge the clause would reduce the court's discretion in those cases. The whole purpose of the Bill is to encourage landlords to let out rooms in their own houses. A farmer in a small house may have relatively few rooms and will therefore be less inclined to let out part of his accommodation if there is little prospect of the tenant leaving within an agreed time. Therefore, the aim is to encourage more people and to allow more flexibility. I agree with the honourable Gentleman that this part of the rent legislation is enormoulsy complex and that it is rather like finding one's way through a maze. I shall look at the provisions, because they must be as readily understandable laymen as they can be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is there not a distinction between tentants who have exclusive use of a bedroom and tenants who regularly share a bedroom as well as other accommodation? In the first case, the tenants are likely to fall into the category to which the Minister referred, where the landlord is letting out a spare bedroom on the basis that he is assured of getting possession of it relatively easily. In the other case, where there is a resident landlord and two, three or perhaps four people are sharing a bedroom, it is a commercial enterprise, because people are making a profit out of the most vulnerable groups—young, single, unemployed people, who tend to end up in such accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister seemed to say earlier that sections 23 and 24 of the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984 will not apply to both groups. Therefore, there will be no protection from eviction not only for those who have exclusive use of a spare bedroom but also for those who are being commercially exploited by a landlord and are sharing three or four to a room, with perhaps 20 people in the one building. Is that what the Minister intends the effect of the clause to be? If so, will he justify it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to be certain that there will be no distinction. Whether a person has exclusive use of a bedroom or shares it with a single landlord in a

	<span class='label label-info column'>881</span>
domestic situation or shares it with many other tenants in a commercial situation, he will have no protection from eviction because of the clause. Is that what the Minister is saying and does he think that that is right?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, it is not as simple as that. For example, tenants who have some exlusive use of the accommodation will in future be assured tenants, and clearly they will be in a different category. But, generally, the honourable Gentleman is correct that the clause would remove the court's discretion in such cases. It refers to the position of resident landlords, and the purpose behind it is to encourage them to bring back into use accommodation which may not be in use at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can understand the Minister's case when he is speaking about a landlord letting out a spare bedroom, but the Bill also allows people to take over a big building as a commercial enterprise and cram people, usually social security claimants, into the bedrooms. The Minister is allowing such people to be exploited and evicted as and when the landlord likes, because he is resident in that establishment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister keeps trying to argue that the Bill will bring back into the private rented sector accommodation which is not available at present, but the balance of advantage will now swing much more decisively in favour of landlords who can evict at will and against tenants who share one bedroom. They also share accommodation elsewhere and are being exploited by a commercial landlord, and the Minister is allowing that to happen. Should we not try to close that loophole and at the same time encourage other people to let a spare bedroom?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To some extent, we are going over ground that we have already covered.

	<br><blockquote><p>"(ff) a voluntary organisation not trading for profit; or"</p></blockquote>
This amendment has been suggested by the Scottish Council for Single Homeless. I hope that the Minister will take on board the points raised by the splendid Mr. Laurie Nauman in addition to some of the other points that he has accepted during the Committee stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Council for the Single Homeless makes this point:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There are still many voluntary, usually charitable, organisations which manage various forms of hostel and supported accommodation which are not registered housing associations, eg small organisations with one or two hostels such as the Edinburgh Council for the Single Homeless, Glasgow Council for the Single Homeless Cyrenians, or larger organisations with several schemes, ie Scottish Association for Mental Health. Scottish Society for the Mentally Handicapped, Salvation Army, Church of Scotland, Young Men's Christian Association, Young Women's Christian Association, etc. It would seem shortsighted not to exclude them at this stage, rather than waiting for an order to be made by "the Secretary of State under Sub-section (g) which should be reserved for very exceptional private or commercial establishments."</p></blockquote>
That seems an intelligent approach to an unintelligent Bill. Would the Minister like to comment on it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the honourable Gentleman has raised this on behalf of the Scottish Council for Single Homeless. Many voluntary and semi-voluntary bodies do valuable and important work in providing hostel accommodation. I agree that such bodies should not be required to obtain a court order to evict an occupant, but I do not believe that the amendment is necessarily the best way to achieve that purpose. It raises questions about the meaning of "trading for profit". It would be unfortunate if bodies that deserve to be exempted under the provision were not so exempted because of that wording. I hope that the Committee will agree to allow us to deal with such organisations under subsection 5(g) which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"any other person who is, or who belongs to a class of person which is, specified in an order made by the Secretary of State".</p></blockquote>
That allows my right honourable Friend to specify additional exemptions by order. I accordingly hope that the amendment will be withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely the sort of bureaucratic procedure that we had hope to avoid. Nevertheless, the Minister has said clearly that the Government intend to exempt that category of accommodation. I was about to seek leave to withdraw the amendment, but I see that another honourable Member wishes to say something.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would it be appropriate for the Minister to look at the amendment with a slightly broader perspective? Voluntary organisations have an important role to play in the working of the new system that the Government are setting up in the Bill.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0564">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>883</span>
I do not know whether the Minister has had any direct discussions with the voluntary organisations. I know that they took great pains and care to give as much positive assistance as possible in the process of consultation that took place in the run-up to the Bill, and the amendment deals with a specific and finely-focused aspect of their work. How does the Minister see the role of the voluntary organisations in the workings of the Bill, once the system is up and running? That would be valuable information, not only for the Committee, but for some of those voluntary organisations, which are studying our debates with some care.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman asked whether I had seen the voluntary organisations. I had a useful discussion last Friday with Age Concern. I understand that the honourable Gentleman is being briefed by that organisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, there are a great many voluntary organisations that we wish to encourage. There is no disagreement between the honourable Gentleman and myself on the purpose. There is a case for exempting voluntary bodies; the only question is how best to do it. We think that it is better to do it under subsection (5)(g), which I mentioned earlier, which gives the Secretary of State powers. The interpretation of the words "trading for profit" could lead to considerable difficulties in practice because of uncertainty about the termination of profit. With that assurance. I hope that the honourable Gentleman will not press the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the honourable Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) that that is helpful so far as it goes. What I am angling for is a debate for a few minutes on the role of the voluntary organisations. It might not be technically appropriate under this amendment, but I hope that the Minister will be prepared at some stage to have a 10 or 15 minute discussion about the role of voluntary organisations, once the Bill is implemented.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are many amendments tabled later, so perhaps we can return to that question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) is right. This is an important area of provision for some of the most needy people in Scotland and it would be remiss of the Committee to complete its proceedings without making any reference to the excellent work done by the organisations to which I have referred—the Salvation Army, the YMCA and so on—which provide hostel accommodation for people with severe housing difficulties. Obviously, legislation should take account of their needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>884</span>
The Minister has rejected the suggestion that such organisations should be specifically excluded from this part of the clause. He has suggested that it would be impossible to draft the relevant legislation. I find that a rather unconvincing explanation because normally if the Government want to draft something they will find a way to do so, but the will does not seem to be there in this instance. However, he has given a clear-cut assurance that it is the intention of the Secretary of State to introduce orders that will make it possible to exclude the sort of accommodation and voluntary organisations that we are talking about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This touches on a very serious matter. I do not believe that the Government have helped voluntary organisations. As a member of the management committee of the North Edinburgh Action Group for the Mentally Handicapped. I am aware that that group is having to spend an increasing amount of time examining the Government legislation on housing benefit, which is particularly-complicated because it has changed so much that it has caused great uncertainty among the mentally handicapped tenants for whom they cater and has necessitated the staff spending a great deal more time on looking at how the legislation is to be implemented and how they can use it to the greatest benefit of their client group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, it seems regrettable that the Government do not accept the need to exempt voluntary organisations at this stage. This is additional legislation that they will have to study and get to grips with, possibly only to be told by the Minister or the Secretary of State that they will be exempt from it. Therefore, if the Minister can assure us that voluntary and charitable organisations will not have to study another clause in a Bill, it will enable them to spend their time more productively on looking after the mentally handicapped, in the case of the North Edinburgh action group and the needs of the elderly in the case of Age Concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have not helped groups such as those by hammering local authorities, which cannot give them the same grants as previously. The organisations are therefore having to devote their time and energy to fund-raising and looking for alternative sources of funds, when the local authority and local people would have wanted to fund them. But the Secretary of State has moved in and rate-capped them so often.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, over the past several years there has been an increase in the number of laws that charitable organisations have had to get to grips with, many of which have not been to the advantage of their client group nor in the public interest, and at the same time a withdrawal of support which has tied up the staff of such organisations in looking for alternative funding. Some have gone to the wall, because that funding has not been available. I hope that the Minister will seriously consider ensuring that they are not further burdened with having to get to grips with an unnecessary clause, to the detriment of the time that they could spend on providing services for their client groups.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot allow the honourable Gentleman's remark that the Government have not supported voluntary organisations to pass without comment. We have given substantial funding to Shelter. At the recent tenants' conference in Glasgow, which I attended, Shelter made it clear that it was grateful for that support. We have also given funding to the Scottish Council for the Single Homeless and to Age Concern, but cases must be weighed on their merits, and the work of those three organisations is very much appreciated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We expect to make the necessary order at the same time as these provisions come into force. Those organisations will not have to consider the matter further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have been prepared to let the matter rest, but I take exception to the Minister quoting an organisation saying that it is grateful for the pittance that the Minister is giving it. I am also very suspicious of the information that the Minister has given us. Last week we knew that he tried to bamboozle the Committee with figures on Housing Corporation funding. Yet, in a written answer which the Minister was good enough to supply me with on Friday, he showed that my evidence was correct and that under Labour funding of the Housing Corporation had quintupled but had risen by only 60 per cent. under the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the honourable Gentleman looks at the written answer, he will see that the original funding for the Housing Corporation in Scotland by the Labour Government was under £10 million. If one starts from a very low base, of course the figures quadruple.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The funding for Shelter runs into many thousands of pounds and over the years has amounted to several hundred thousand pounds. It is certainly not a pittance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief, because we have already dealt with a number of details on the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has become clear during debates on amendments to the clause that the intention behind the clause is to reduce the limited security available to tenants in particularly vulnerable categories. We do not like the principle of reducing security of tenure in such instances. Therefore, I should be inclined to vote against the clause standing part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If there is a Division I, too, shall vote against the clause, not only for the reasons outlined by the honourable Member for East Lothian but also because of the technical device that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>886</span>
Government are using. At the risk of sounding repetitive, I cannot support the way in which clause 37 is constructed or the way in which it seeks to achieve its objectives. We have had arguments during our debates on the Government's objectives and policy and what they are setting out to achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At some stage, however, Parliament will have to take a view on how legislation is constructed; I do not believe that we pay enough attention to this. I object in principle to orders set out as they are in proposed new section 23A which we are inserting into the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984. Clause 37(6) speaks about orders
	<br><blockquote><p>"subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament"</p></blockquote>
using the negative procedure. I object to that in principle because I think that the negative procedure is totally unsatisfactory. The procedure of praying against orders is an unsatisfactory device. If orders must be brought forward, they should be subject to the affirmative procedure. As a matter of principle, the Committee should object to the Government taking legislative powers and using the negative order procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole edifice of the clause is defective. Of course the detail is complicated; it has to be. Not only is the Committee defining words like "accommodation"; it is trying to seek statutory definitions of words such as "owner" and "occupier" and of phrases such as "a member of the family". Section 83(2)(b) of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987, which is imported into the Bill through the proposed new section 23A to the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984, provides that
	<br><blockquote><p>"A relationship of the half-blood shall be treated as a relationship of the whole blood".</p></blockquote>
It is not crystal clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It sounds like the Old Testament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Old Testament is probably a good deal clearer in its meaning than of the labyrinthine statutory edifices we erect to deal with some of our legislative problems. It is not a matter of policy or politics. I am sure that from a statutory legislative framework point of view this is the wrong way to proceed. We will eventually sink under the detail that we are importing into housing law. The Bill—and clause 37 in particular—does not help that. For that reason, if for no other, the Committee should reject it, on the basis that it is incomprehensive and bad law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot resist coming back again. Clearly, the detailed negotiations in the alliance in recent months about constitutions have had a serious effect on the honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood). He is anxious to ensure that details of structure and the constitution should be absolutely right. Unfortunately, there is no reference to VAT on children's clothes in the clause, but I dare say that it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0566">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>887</span>
could be included. The honourable Gentleman said in the preamble to his somewhat excitable speech that he had no faith in the power of prayer in the parliamentary context. Good Catholic though he knows me to be, in that context I have to agree with him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the last debate I raised with the Minister the case of the young, single unemployed people who live in multiple occupancy accommodation, sharing bedrooms. The Minister has said that he will reconsider that, but he has not given a guarantee to the Committee that he will take any action on it. For that reason, if for no other, every member of the Committee who is concerned about the position of that group should vote against the clause, unless the Minister will give us an assurance that he will act to do something for what is probably the most vulnerable group of occupiers in Scotland today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We had an extensive debate on the subject of multiple occupancy and the matter will be followed up through consultation later in the year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would say to the honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) that we shall look again at the clause, but I do not agree with him on the negative order procedure. It is frequently used in statutes, including those put forward by Labour Governments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is nothing to do with me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There was a time when this country had a Liberal Government and I have no doubt that if we look at the Acts of Parliament passed in that period we will find that negative order procedure operated then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 37 makes it possible for certain limited types of occupier to be evicted without a court order. These include squatters, holiday makers, hostel dwellers and tenants of resident landlords. As I have explained, the last group is included because resident landlords have often been unable to evict an unsatisfactory tenant without going through a lengthy procedure. I have already undertaken to consider the arguments for a limit on the number of occupiers a resident landlord can have if he is to be exempted under the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But why has the Minister opted for the negative procedure? I am sufficiently long in the tooth now to know that such orders are an essential part of the parliamentary process, but the Minister has a choice. The Minister could have chosen the affirmative procedure, which seems to me to be always preferable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Many of these categories are relatively uncontroversial.

We come now to clause 38, which empowers the Secretary of State to allow private sector rents to go through the roof in Scotland. We are opposed to the principle of the Government's purpose and we shall vote against clause 38 standing part of the Bill in due course. Initially, we want to try a spot of damage limitation by seeking to amend the clause.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0567">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>889</span>
The amendments would allow the Secretary of State to amend sections 33 and 58 of the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984, but they would not go so far as to allow him to repeal those phasing provisions altogether. Specifically, the amendments would retain the principle of rent increase limitation for all existing tenancies. Incidentally, Mr. Lambie, this debate will give the Government an opportunity to explain how and when they intend to implement this part of the Bill—how and when they intend to remove the restrictions that prevent rent increases from progressing at an intolerable rate in the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that these controls on rent increases were originally conceived by a Conservative Government in 1973 and that it was a Labour Government that put them formally on to the statute book in 1975. The present restriction is that rent increases in the private sector cannot exceed £104 per year—£2 per week—or 25 per cent., whichever is the greater. Even if the rent officer or—in terms of the Bill—the rent assessment committee sets a higher rent increase, the actual rate of increase towards that higher rent is restricted by those criteria to either £2 a week maximum or 25 per cent., in order to give the tenant time to adjust his budget to cope with a substantial increase in his household expenses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That first criterion of £104 a year maximum increase was overtaken by events for most houses, I presume, in 1981. In that year, the average annual registered rent in private sector housing in Scotland rose £443 per year, and 25 per cent. of that is more than £104; so presumably in most cases the 25 per cent. limit is now the governing factor affecting the restriction on rent increases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put it to the Committee that that 25 per cent. limit is extremely generous to landlords. It is way above the current level of inflation; and even the post-war record price inflation in 1975 fell short of 25 per cent. That restriction still provides, therefore, for a comparatively rapid escalation of rents, and conversely it is of limited benefit to tenants. That 25 per cent. limit still allows rents in the private sector to gravitate upwards pretty rapidly, and it is not that much use to tenants whose incomes are certainly not rising by 25 per cent. a year. Any system that allows rents to increase by 25 per cent. year after year cannot be said to give much comfort to tenants. But at least there is something, and the Government are now proposing to remove even that very limited protection against outlandish and extortionate rent increases being imposed by landlords.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to emphasis that the phasing restriction was introduced in the context of a system of controlled and registered rents in Scotland. The proposal under discussion is to scrap the phasing provision, and it is being done as part of a Bill that intends to do away with the fair rent system, the registration system and the control system altogether and to let market forces rip in private sector tenancies. The free market in housing has little to do with what tenants can afford. It is based predominantly on what a landlord can hope to obtain. That is what the Bill is all about: it is all about
	<span class='label label-info column'>890</span>
encouraging private sector landlords. Clearly one of the best ways to do that is by the prospect of higher and higher incomes and the ability to extract more and more money from their tenants in future.

We have already established that housing for the foreseeable future in Scotland will be a sellers' market, with a shortage of decent housing in the right places and with no fewer than one-quarter of the population desperate to escape from overcrowded accommodation. In those circumstances, market forces could easily have a severe ratchet effect on rents. It is worth considering what has happened to private sector rents in recent years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a written reply which the Minister gave me on 27th October 1987 he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Average registered rents in private sector unfurnished accommodation have risen from £3.50 per house per week in 1979–80 to £16.29 in 1986–87". —[	<i>Official Report,</i> 27 October 1987; Vol. 121, c.236.]</p></blockquote>
That represents an increase of 365 per cent. over those seven years. During the same period earnings and the retail prices index rose considerably less rapidly. That increase of 365 per cent. is four times the rate of increase of earnings, which went up by only 94 per cent. in those seven years, and five and a half times the rate of inflation, which went up by 67 per cent. Therefore, that 25 per cent. restriction must have been a significant help at least to sitting tenants in that rapid escalation of private sector rents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fear that the clause is intended to increase both the rate and the speed of rent increases in Scotland, and there must be a severe risk that rent increases will outpace increases in incomes. It is worth referring to some of the information put before the Committee, and in particular to the responses made by a group of tenants to the Government's consultation document. I quote from the review of responses prepared for COSLA by the Planning Exchange in October 1987:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A tenants' association in an inner area housing association noted:</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>'In our area over three quarters of all tenants are now claimants—either unemployed or pensioners. Tenants depending on a wage income have increasingly been unable to afford new lets and have moved out."</p></blockquote>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>'We believe that rent levels of houses with private landlords will inevitably increase in line with their desire to secure and increase profits.'"</p></blockquote>
A legitimate fear is being expressed there. I refer now to the Scottish Development Department's paper dated 17 November 1987 on the private rented sector and the implications for housing benefit. Paragraph 13 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The rent set by the rent officer will not be a maximum rent chargeable for the dwelling. It will be open to the landlord to set the rent at the maximum eligible level, or to charge a higher rent and seek a tenant willing to pay that rent. It will be open to the existing tenant, should he have the means to do so, to make up the difference."</p></blockquote>
If the Government have their way under the Bill, we shall move into a framework of rapid escalation of rents, to encourage landlords, and precious little consideration given to the circumstances of any category of tenants in any neighbourhood. It is clearly a major concern for people on lower incomes. Knowing as we all do as Members of the House from
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0568">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>891</span>
our constituency work the complications and restrictiveness of the housing benefit system, all Opposition Members would like a proper explanation from the Minister about the Government's plans for housing benefit in relation to the clause. That explanation should also take into account the even more sinister implications of clause 64, which will enable the Secretary of State to compel local authorities to penalise tenants if their rents are too high, as if tenants have any control over the future level of rents in Scotland under this regime which the Government want to usher in. Perhaps the Minister will tell us in the context of this debate whether housing benefits will be linked to the actual market rent which is being stoked up by the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principle of phasing should be retained. I would argue that the 25 per cent. level should be cut to a more realistic figure which bears some relationship to the rate of inflation or the increase in earnings. We shall want to go over the more general ground of the principle of phasing in the stand part debate, especially in connection with the extraordinary contradiction between the Government's stated objective of stamping out inflation and the specific provision in the Bill to increase the inflation of rents spectacularly. I find it bizarre that although in the Bill, the Government have talked about the need to control harassment and to prevent homelessness, in the window dressing clauses that we have had up until now, nothing is more associated with harassment of tenants than the unreasonable increase of rents year after year. What could be more likely to increase homelessness in Scotland than forcing up rents to levels that some tenants cannot afford? We shall be able to return to that general principle shortly. I want to dwell for a second on one of the amendments by referring to a problem that has been raised by the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations. The brief that it has handed to members of the Committee says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We would also suggest that some of the knock-on effects of the abolition of rent phasing may not have been properly considered. In particular, associations have pointed out that in area renewal work the existence of rent phasing is very important in progressing negotiations with existing owners and tenants. The prospect of very large rent increases—in one go—can still be a serious disincentive to existing tenants and owner-occupiers (who are selling to an association) even with the prospect of significant improvement in their housing conditions. Equally, there are fears expressed that the proposed abolition will lead to an increase in rent arrears and therefore difficult management problems."</p></blockquote>
In addition to fending off that problem—or making it possible for them to fend it off—for housing associations, it would also ensure that the abolition of rent phasing would not apply retrospectively to existing tenancies. We are debating an extremely important aspect of the Bill. I repeat that we are strongly opposed to the principle of what the Government's are doing, by taking the lid off rent increases in the private sector. When I say "taking the lid off", I mean precisely that. The present 25 per cent. restriction is not much of a lid. By removing even that 25 per cent. restriction, allowing landlords to increase rents year after year by more than 25 per cent. at a time, the Government are raising alarming
	<span class='label label-info column'>892</span>
prospects. We intend to vote against the clause. It would be interesting to know whether the Government would be prepared to accept amendments to mitigate the application of this evil clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government's case throughout part II is that the private rented sector is in decline because existing statutory provision is unfair to landlords. They say that security of tenure under existing statutes and the fair rent system are too fair to tenants. Therefore, they have come up with the solution that there should be a switch away from the existing secure or protected tenancies towards the new assured tenancies which would both weaken security of tenure and scrap the fair rent system. We are assured that for existing tenants, the only change will be the gradual abolition of the phasing in of rent increases. We still have a look at that gradual abolition as part of the pattern of the Governments' beefing up the housing legislation to the advantage of landlords as well as to the disadvantage of tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those who support the scrapping of phasing in of rent increases are clear about why they should do so. The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors, for example, circularised all the Members of the Committee decrying the phasing in of rent increases as a continuing hindrance to obtaining what they described as reasonable market rents. I assume that by that they mean rents at which the landlord can make a big profit. They also pointed out that phasing in was one of the prime causes behind the contraction of the private rented sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is interesting that my honourable Friend should refer to the restriction of 25 per cent. per year, which is not much of a restriction, as a prime cause for the contracting of the private rented sector. He may be interested to know that the private rented sector in Scotland was already decreasing when the first rent control measure was introduced in 1915, so they have been bleating on about that for a long time and it does not mean very much.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my honourable Gentleman for pointing that out. I was stating not my own view but that of the of the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors. I have learnt from my honourable Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) the chartered surveyors normally act on behalf of landlords, so it is not surprising that they should take the view that phasing in of rent increases is reprehensible from their point of view and that of of their clients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State for Scotland has also sid why he thinks phasing in should be abolished. I notice that he has joined the Committee this morning. I do not know whether that is a good or a bad thing—he usually just sits there like a blob of jelly contributing nothing but the occasional jibe at the Opposition. On Second Reading he said that phasing in prevented a landlord from obtaining a proper rent for his premises. I assume that by a proper rent he means the same as the chartered surveyors mean—a rent at
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0569">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>893</span>
which the landlord can exploit the tenant by making a large profit. The only difference between the Secretary of State for Scotland and the chartered surveyors is that he wants to phase the system out on a timetable, which he says would be fair to both landlord and tenant, while the chartered surveyors want to scrap it immediately and have the full increase imposed right away. It is refreshing to see that the Secretary of State for Scotland is to the Left of at least some people in Scotland, because he has been moving rapidly to the Right since the last general election, if that is possible in the Tory party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have become fixated to the point of obsession with making things as easy as possible for landlords. They have become blinkered to all other housing considerations except what would be good for landlords and how the Government can best help the landlords to make a quick and easy profit from any putative investment in housing that they might be prepared to consider. Clause 38 must be seen within the overall context of the whole of part II of the Bill and the wholesale favouring of the landlord's position at the expense of the tenants' interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the existing system housing association rents are still significantly higher than new town, local authority or SSHA rents. On average, they are 30 per cent. higher than local authority rents. Yet where existing regimes for local authorities and the SSHA are to stay much the same, fair rents are to be scrapped altogether for housing association tenants. For existing housing association tenants the result will be the scrapping of the phasing in of rent increases. The Scottish Federation of Housing Associations is completely opposed to the scrapping of the phasing in of rent increases. It points out that to abolish rent phasing would
	<br><blockquote><p>"present housing associations with genuine fears. Such a proposal would place an unacceptable burden on housing association tenants, especially when the triennial increases are often very considerable. Fears are expressed that an increase in rent arrears could result. Rent phasing is also very important in area renewal work acting as an incentive in negotiations with existing owners and tenants who are selling to associations. Abolition could severely hinder area renewal programmes."</p></blockquote>
The Government should take on board the fact that housing associations can use the phasing in of rent increases when they are negotiating with existing tenants in tenements which they are seeking to rehabilitate under the housing association movement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have accepted in their consultation paper on finance for housing associations that housing association activity in Scotland is distinctly different from that South of the border, where housing associations are much more likely to meet general needs housing, which accounts for two thirds of housing association activity in England and Wales. The Government themselves pointed out that Scottish associations had their origins largely in the requirement to provide housing for those with special needs, tenement rehabilitation and area renewal. Why, then, are the Government scrapping the phasing in of rent increases, when that
	<span class='label label-info column'>894</span>
assists the housing association movement in Scotland in carrying out the area renewal schemes which the Government claim they want to see?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Just as serious as that consideration is the consideration of the impact on tenants of finding themselves faced with sudden huge rent increases. As the Minister will know, the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations has issued to all members of the Committee a report called "Who Do We House", which is a survey of housing association tenants in Scotland. It was an academic study carried out last year, which looked at more than 1,000 households among the housing associations in Scotland. It clearly identified the groups housed by housing associations. For example, on page 2 in the summary of its main findings it says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Compared with old Scottish households, new housing association tenants consisted disproportionately of single non-elderly adult households and one and two person elderly households."</p></blockquote>
That seems to suggest that far more young, single and mainly unemployed people are being housed by housing associations, as well as far more pensioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The survey found that family households were under-represented, as one would expect if the housing association movement does not effectively meet general needs housing in Scotland as it does in England and Wales. It also found that single-parent families featured almost as frequently as two-parent families. Therefore, another group in acute housing need is being catered for by the housing associations. It found that household incomes were significantly lower than the average, even among those in work. Therefore, again housing associations are meeting a need in Scotland which is not being met by other types of housing providers. The survey found that among all household types economic activity was low, which is a euphemism for saying that there is a great deal of unemployment among housing association tenants, and that a majority of single, non-elderly adult households and single-parent family households contain no worker.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The survey concluded that, compared with housing associations in the rest of Great Britain, Scottish tenant households are more likely to be elderly and to be either unemployed or on very low incomes. It pointed out that over a half of all single adults and over a third of two-adult households and single-parent households had no accommodation of their own before moving into housing association tenancy. That suggests that the housing association movement is meeting the needs of the homeless in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the fact that the housing association movement is distinctly different from that in England and Wales, the Government should not seek to apply the same conditions to both. Whereas a comparison can be made between the private rented sector and the housing association movement in England and Wales, because both attempt to meet general needs housing requirements, that is not the case in Scotland. The Minister should accept that and seek ways of treating the housing association movement in Scotland separately from the way in which the Government treat the movement in England and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0570">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>895</span>
I have a briefing from the Hillcrest housing association of Dundee, which shows its concern about the abolition of the phasing-in of rent increases. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Hillcrest view with particular alarm the proposal to eliminate the existing rent phasing provisions in Scotland … The existing rent phasing provisions, though by no means perfect, are recognised by the Association to at least offer some method of softening the blow of substantial rental increases which are often beyond the existing levels of inflation."</p></blockquote>
That is particularly true when one considers the type of households in housing association houses such as those in Hillcrest, compared with households elsewhere. The letter say that to abolish rent phasing provisions
	<br><blockquote><p>"would create undue hardship on tenants faced with sudden large increases in their rents. A further consequence of this would be a sharp increase in Associations' rent arrears which seems at odds with one of the Government's stated objectives in making Associations more cost effective and efficient".</p></blockquote>
If the Government would like to see housing associations becoming more cost effective and efficient why are they putting them into the position in which rent arrears will accumulate? By definition, that will make them less cost effective and efficient than at present, and the Government should take that on board. The paragraph concludes by saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The effect of the proposed abolition could be extensively felt amongst Housing Associations and Hillcrest estimate that the current provisions benefit a majority of our tenants."</p></blockquote>
To abolish rent phasing provisions, or to phase them out, would be to the disadvantage not only of the tenants but of the housing associations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should address himself to the concerns expressed by the housing associations about the impact of abolishing the rent phasing provisions, and moving to the new market rents—what the Secretary of State referred to as "proper rents"—which are not appropriate in the Scottish housing context. It is time that the Minister, as a Scottish housing Minister, realised the needs of Scottish housing associations and began to deal with them, by responding to what we are legitimately asking him to do, that is, not to abolish the phasing of rent increases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Doran 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Both my honourable Friends the Members for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) and for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) have talked about the principle of removing phasing, which concerns me greatly. I am also concerned about the principles that the Government seek to apply. My concerns were increased by reading the White Paper which preceded the Bill, which made no mention of the proposed removal of phasing. Paragraph 4.11 of the White Paper says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government do not propose to make any substantial changes in the regime for existing tenancies subject to the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984. It would not be right to disturb these existing tenancies, though minor amendments will be made to the succession rules. As and when such tenancies come to an end, landlords will be free to relet on the new basis."</p></blockquote>
It strikes me that to remove the phasing principle, which has been part of the legislation since 1965, or perhaps earlier, is to remove a fundamental right of
	<span class='label label-info column'>896</span>
existing tenants. These phasing provisions were seen as a protection for tenants and as being fair to landlords. They recognised a landlord's right to a return on his investment and at the same time allowed the tenant the opportunity to catch up on the sometimes considerable increases involved, particularly during the 1970s, when inflation was let rip.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why did the Minister not have the courage to explain to tenants that the right to phasing was to be removed from them, and why is he removing from tenants the right to attend public meetings of local authorities, the right to a written lease, the right to buy in some cases, and the right to be safeguarded against loss of secure tenancy on transfer? All these rights are being lost. This is the fifth major right that tenants will lose as a result of the Bill. These are considerable rights and we should hear the Government's justification for removing them. It is not good enough to say that landlords will get a better deal—tenants are entitled to a deal as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are all sorts of platitudes in the White Paper about the safeguards that will be provided for tenants. For example paragraph 4.12 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government are concerned that tenants' interests continue to be safeguarded. The Rent Act protects tenants against harassment and provides for the involvement of the rent officer in determining rents. In addition, housing benefit is, and will continue to be, available to tenants who need it to help with their housing costs. These or improved safeguards will continue for existing tenants, and similar safeguards will be provided for tenants under the proposed new arrangements."</p></blockquote>
There is no sign there that plasing will be removed. Again, a significant right will be removed without notice to any organisation or individual involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to take on board the changes in housing benefit. I do not know how these will work and in paragraph 4.14 the Government say that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The housing benefit system will continue to provide help to those who need it. Once rents are deregulated, however, it will be necessary to ensure that landlords cannot increase the rents of benefit recipients to unreasonable levels at the expense of the taxpayer."</p></blockquote>
We know that the rent arrangement between a tenant and landlord will be subject to review. The tenant may not necessarily get the full rent paid to him through his housing benefit if it is regarded as being unreasonable. There may now be rent increases which will not be met by the housing benefit system if they are regarded as unreasonable because no phasing will be allowed. Will the Minister advise us on how that provision will operate?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My honourable Friend the Member for Dundee, East has mentioned the briefings provided to him by the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations, which has sent me a number of comments made by housing associations. It is important that these should go on the record because they show the real concerns of housing associations in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Housing associations are sensible enough to see that there are two sides to phasing. On one side is the position of tenants who will have the opportunity to adjust to new rent levels. On the other there is the prospect for the landlord that he may be able to strike what may be an advantageous arrangement with the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0571">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>897</span>
tenant using the inducement of the phasing arrangements. I shall quote from the briefs. For example, the Central Govan Housing Association in Glasgow states its attitude towards the discontinuation of rent phasing in this way:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This proposal is a matter of some concern given the financial impact this could have on those whose rent is presently subject to phasing. In the case of amalgamations within improvement schemes, this could lead to immediate rent increases. The importance of rent phasing in progressing negotiations with existing owners and tenants within housing action areas should not be overlooked."</p></blockquote>
These are problems which it believes will occur in development schemes. It will have an obligation to its members to recover the rents to which it is entitled, but when the phasing is removed, there is no inducement for the tenant, or the owner who becomes a tenant, to agree to the proposals. The Charing Cross Association from Glasgow comments:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Proposals relating to the abolition of rent phasing seriously jeopardises the future programmes within this area. Rent phasing has been used as a tool to ensure the smooth transition for tenants from unimproved to improved stock."</p></blockquote>
This is again the same point from another housing association that works in the inner city. We know from statements from the Government how much importance they place on improving the inner city. The housing associations say that those efforts will be prejudiced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Whiteinch and Scotstown Housing Association in Glasgow says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The loss of entitlement to rent phasing will hit some of our tenants very hard and could present new obstacles to our programme. Tenants living in sub-tolerable conditions may prefer to continue to suffer these conditions rather than to accept accommodation to modern standards and thereby be subject to immediate doubling (or even trebling) of their rent. The present system effectively limits rent increases to being applied at the rate of no more than about £2 a week in any year."</p></blockquote>
Again, an association working in the inner city area, which sees the present system as advantageous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Edinvar Housing Association, from Edinburgh, which will be close to the heart of the Minister says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"On registration fair rents can be increased by anything between 15 and 30 per cent. the precentage increase generally has been higher than the rate of inflation during the period in question. At present, the effect is cushioned by the tenant's rent being increased each year by a maximum of £104 or 25 per cent. of the total increase. Without a system of rent phasing tenants will have to face the full financial effect of a rent increase in each third year. This increase could be a very significant sum, possibly £25 per month, to find from a low income resulting in severe financial and budgeting problems for tenants and severe arrears management problems for housing associations. Discontinuing rent phasing will place enormous financial pressures on tenants on low incomes and create severe arrears management problems for housing associations."</p></blockquote>
The housing association has repeated itself at the end. These are the problems that housing associations, which are the essential tool of modernisation of the housing stock in many run down parts of the city, will face. This measure will put them in a worse position. They oppose rent phasing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not good enough to say that landlords need this power just because the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors has been screaming for perhaps the last 18
	<span class='label label-info column'>898</span>
years about the penance that rent restriction places on them. Phasing has worked to the benefit of tenants and of landlords. Unless the Minister can convince me otherwise by producing real evidence, I shall find it difficult to accept this power. I ask the Minister to think again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another point concerns me about the measure. Labour Members have criticised the drafting of the Bill. Reading it and trying to make sense of what it seeks to do. I find difficult, notwithstanding my legal training. The intention of clause 38(1) is to allow the repeal of sections 33 and 58. Under the provisions of clause 38(2), the Government are to be allowed by the order made under clause 38(1) to:
	<br><blockquote><p>"amend any enactment (including this Act.)"</p></blockquote>
Why does the drafting not say "repeal or vary", rather than have us check back section after section? The purpose of this measure is to allow the Secretary of State to introduce new phasing arrangements. The notes on clauses relating to clause 38(2) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This subsection, in conjunction with subsection (1), allows the Secretary of State to amend sections 33 and 58 of the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984 by order."</p></blockquote>
Subsection (2) does not say that; it says that he may amend "any enactment", not sections 33 and 58 of the Rent (Scotland) Act. Why is there not more precision rather than this blanket approach which seems to allow the Secretary of State to do anything that he considers desirable?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also concerned that Acts of Parliament—this measure is not unique—can be dealt with in this way. Important principles are involved. We are discussing phasing. Any order that is made by the Secretary of State will clearly, in the terms of this subsection, be subject to approval by the House, but not to discussion and detailed consideration and debate in Committee. We shall not have the opportunity to consider the new proposals. They will impact seriously on the daily lives of a large number of people in Scotland. I am concerned at the way in which the measure has been drafted. It strikes me as lacking in clarity, confusing and giving far more powers than are necessary to the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other points should be picked up. Again, a literal reading of clause 38(1) suggests that it gives the Secretary of State the power to repeal sections 33 and 58; but it gives him no other power than to repeal. In clause 38(4) certain words are substituted in the sections of the 1984 Act that are to be repealed. It strikes me as daft. There are simpler ways to legislate. The old Scots Parliament had a wonderful way of doing it, but here we seem to be getting into technical confusion. I have already congratulated the Minister on the number of jobs that this measure is creating for the legal profession in Dundee. I mean in Scotland—that was a Freudian slip. The people in Scotland expect a little more out of legislation than simply jobs for lawyers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Most of the arguments have already been deployed on this group of amendments with some eloquence by earlier speakers.

My purpose was to ensure that the Committee would have such a wide-ranging debate as we have had this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make the opposition to this aspect of the Bill unanimous, and I do so principally for three reasons. The first was advertised to by the honourable Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran), when he said that there had been discussion. Certainly, in the representations that were made to me and in the work in which I was involved, both from a constituency and wider point of view, at no stage in any of the consultation papers—the White Paper, Green Paper or statements—did the Government presage this change. It is a significant change, and I want to know what happened between the publication of the White Paper and the publication of the Bill that persuaded the Government to introduce that change. I do not have a suspicious nature—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And you are still a member of the alliance?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I need protection, Mr. Lambie. Anyone who is of a suspicious disposition must come to the conclusion that the Government are trying to slip this through without havng the courage to go public and stimulate discussion on the need for such a change. Again, the honourable Member for Aberdeen, South adverted to the essential need for the Government to come forward with hard evidence as to why sections 33 and 58 of the 1984 Act are not working and require amendment. They seem just to have taken a look at all the inhibitions that they perceive are being put on the willingness of landlords to let property. They have gone with a fine toothcomb through all the bits and pieces of restrictive legislation perceived from the landlord's point of view and they are excising it. If that is the case, and if that is the extent of the evidence that the Government are using to bring about the change, it is not good enough. The Government have a case to answer as to why they have have been silent on this issue until the publication of the Bill, to the detriment of the whole consultation process, including the White Paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, sections 33 and 58 in the 1984 Act have to my knowledge been working perfectly well. Certain aspects of that Act have not had long to work their way through, settle and bed down properly, and get case precedents decided and so on. There are question marks hanging over some of the provisions of the 1984 Act, but the phasing in procedures have been on the statute book for at least 20 years and they are familiar aspects of housing law to any practitioner north of the border in the courts. The courts are familiar with them and in my constituency they have been working particularly well. In my role as a provincial solicitor before I was elected to this place,
	<span class='label label-info column'>900</span>
in any casework in which I was involved I was satisfied that the phasing aspects of rent increases and the progression to a registered rent were working well, and unless the Government have examples to show that that has changed, we should be suspicious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the honourable Member for Aberdeen, South again raised the question about the procedures used in subsections (1) and (2) to bring about this rather elaborate and quite unnecessary parliamentary and legislative device. He said that that was a bad way to introduce legislation, and I agree. My suspicions go even further. If the Government had a clear idea of what they wanted to do, they would have put it in the Bill. They have not done so, because they are afraid to put into the Bill what they are contemplating. That is a legitimate conclusion to draw from the procedures in the conjunction of subsections (1) and (2).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another option has just occured to me. Either the Government do not know what they want to do—in which case the question about evidence of a need for this change is even more important—or, alternatively, they are afraid to say what they want to do. They will put the Bill on the statute book and one night late in the winter, when we are all trying to work through the changes in the primary legislation, they will bring forward an order containing levels of horror that they are not prepared to place before the Committee at this stage. That is a perfectly legitimate interpretation of this device.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman is quite right to suggest that the Government may be deliberately trying to conceal what they are up to. My honourable Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) referred to the absence of any reference to this provision in the White Paper, which was published on 11 November 1987. However, in a plain, brown envelope on 17 November came a nice little letter from the Scottish Development Department headed, "Papers on Housing: (a) Private Rented Sector; (b) Private Rented Sector—Implications for Housing Benefit," which states in paragraph 3.4:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State intends to take powers to abolish or vary the existing statutory phasing of registered rent increases."</p></blockquote>
They were saying one thing at the press conference with the White Paper, but are much more coy about other aspects of the Bill. The honourable Gentleman was quite right to highlight that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That destroys one of my other points—that it was not part of the consultation process.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Tell us more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish the honourable Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) would leave me to get on with my speech. My principal point is about the procedure that is being used in subsections (1) and (2), which leads to a suspicion that the Government are afraid to say clearly and plainly to the Committee what they have in mind. They either have something in mind or they have not. If they have not, that advocates that the clause should not be brought forward at all. If they have, they should have the courage at this stage—because we have moved on a good number of weeks since the Bill was published—to say that they intend to make specific changes and table amendments themselves. That would be a much more honest way of handling the matter before the Committee this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, there is no question of secrecy. The consultation document "The Private Rented Sector" was issued on 17 November, and the relevant paragraph is paragraph 23, which states in relation to regulated tenancies:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For such tenancies, landlords and tenants will continue to have the right to register a fair rent and to re-register the rent every three years. At a future date, however, the Government intend to abolish the provisions relating to the phasing of rent increases, since phasing distorts the market and prevents landlords from receiving the full rent due. When a tenancy with a registered rent comes to an end, the registration will cease to have any effect; and if the property is to be re-let, the landlord will be obliged to let it under the new regime as an assured tenancy or short assured tenancy."</p></blockquote>
That is a different situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did the Minister receive representations in the course of consultation about that? It seems to me that there was not enough time for anybody sensible to respond to that. Were any representations made on that point and, if so, from whom?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Honourable Members have a list of the representations that we received.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not receive one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was readily available. Representations have been sent in and my understanding is that some of them were in the Library unless people asked for their representations to kept confidential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) asked about the drafting subsection (2). The formula "any enactment" is a standard form. It would have to be relevant to sections 33 and 58.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Gentleman also referred to the conflict with clause 38. There is none. The amendments to subsections (4) and (5) are to change the existing provisions to allow the Secretary of State to phase out phasing. The powers in subsection (1) to (3) repeat these sections when phasing has disappeared completely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for East Lothian (Mr.
	<span class='label label-info column'>902</span>
Home Robertson) asked whether there would be retrospective abolition of phasing. The answer is emphatically no; it applies only to future rent increases and not to private ones. He also asked whether rents would increase at an intolerable rate. Clause 38 relates only to registered rents for regulated tenancies under the existing legislation. There will be control over rent levels growing too fast because these rents will still be subject to registration by the rent officer. I cannot say exactly at what rate they will increase, because that would involve predicting the movement of registered rents, but at present the average over a three-year period is an increase of about 19 per cent. That is the interval between the re-registration of rents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) raised the important subject of housing associations. I understand that we shall both be visiting housing associations in or near his constituency on Friday. Housing associations apply rent increases set by the rent officer. For tenants who remain on registered rents, the gradual phasing out of rent increases will ease the change of them. For tenants in new assured tenancies it will be for the association to decide the extent and timing of rent increases, balancing the interests of their tenants and the need to improve their homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rents of housing association houses are to be let at levels below the market level for many groups. I am referring particularly to the special interest groups which the honourable Gentleman had in mind. The phrase we use is "affordable", and that is precisely the intention. We recognise that housing associations cater in Scotland for a wide group of the population which is in necessitous circumstances. The provision affects housing association tenants only in the phasing of rent increases. Housing benefit will clearly cover the circumstances of those who need it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Roberson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The consultation document makes it clear that a landlord will still be free to try to obtain a higher rent for his property even than that set by the rent officer. Paragraph 14 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is proposed that once a maximum rent has been set for housing benefit subsidy purposes there will be a period of probably a year during which no increase in that rent will be considered for subsidy purposes, even if there is a change of tenant, unless it can be demonstrated that there has been a material change in the condition of the dwelling or the terms of the tenancy."</p></blockquote>
I do not know whether the rent is included in "terms of the tenancy". I fear that that paragraph suggests that rents could not only go up by significantly more than 25 per cent. because the Government propose to take the lid off rents, but also that the worst-off tenants will not be protected by the housing benefit system for at least a year in spite of what the Minister has said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This clause has no effect on entitlement to housing benefit. Those who are worst off will continue to have entitlement to housing benefit as in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be helpful to explain why we are taking the power in clause 38 progressively to remove phasing
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0574">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>903</span>
of rent increases for tenancies covered by the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984. There are two arguments, one of principle, the other related to current circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, it seems wrong that a landlord should be denied the full rent to which the rent officer of the rent assessment committee has decided he is entitled for his house, as soon as the rent is registered. That is the argument of principle. On the practical side, I accept that there might have been a case for phasing when inflation was high, but now that our economic policies have consistently produced low inflation, there is no longer any pressing need for phasing. We see keeping inflation under control as a continuing process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To take up the point raised by the honourable Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion), we recognise, however, that regulated tenants currently have an expectation that their rent increases will be phases. That is why we have chosen to remove phasing progressively rather than to abolish it all at once.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way on the point about inflation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is not a general debate on inflation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has said that the Government are immensely proud that they have controlled inflation regardless of the price paid for it in other respects. How can he square that commitment to continue to control inflation with the objective of clause 38 to allow rents to rise at more than 25 per cent. per year?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously it is highly desirable to control inflation for the sake of old age pensioners, otherwise their income decreases considerably in comparison with the rise in the level of inflation. As I have explained, a landlord should not be denied the full rent to which the rent officer of the rent assessment committee has decided that he is entitled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot accept amendments Nos. 413 and 414. They would mean that phasing of rent increases would continue to apply for ever more to regulated tenancies, for we intend to begin the progressive removal of phasing at the commencement of this part of the Bill. From that date, no new regulated tenancies will be able to be entered into, so, whether intentionally or not, these amendments would have the effect of weakening this provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In relation to amendment No. 287, clause 38(2) looks as if it is an extremely wide power. I assure honourable Gentlemen that the words that we have used are standard and that the provision could not be used to amend an enactment which had nothing to do with the purpose of clause 38.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister give an example of any other legislation that uses this device?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>904</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the honourable Gentleman gives me notice, I will come back to him on that point. I am sure that the phrase "any enactment" in subsection (2) is standard for consequential amendments of this kind. Is that the point that the honourable Gentleman was making?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise that that is a standard phrase. This device in subsections (1) and (2) is new to me—that may be due to my inexperience, although I suspect that it is not—so I should be interested to know whether there are any provisions in any other United Kingdom statute that use this device.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to say that the answer is yes. If the honourable Member will give me a little notice we will find examples and let him have them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order to repeal sections 33 and 58 will be, unusually, subject to positive resolution of both houses of Parliament. That will give honourable Members a further opportunity to discuss the matter, if they so wish, before phasing is entirely abolished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 416 and 417 will remove one of the options for progressively eliminating phasing, which we think would be helpful, that is, the power to reduce the periods between phases. The disadvantage of phasing, as honourable Members are aware, is that the landlord is prevented from receiving the full rent, independently determined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for East Lothian clearly feels that it is unfair to expect a tenant to pay a large increase in rent right away. Clause 38(4) and (5) would give an opportunity to solve that problem by reducing the periods between phases, perhaps to six months in the first instance. I should be glad to hear honourable Members' views on that point. We can ensure that the landlord receives his full rent more quickly, but also that the tenant still faces gradual increases rather than having to find the whole increase at once.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said earlier, I see this matter being carried out gradually, and I do not expect the Secretary of State to be in a position to bring a proposal before the House for approval to abolish phasing entirely for about five years after the commencement of the provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: After the next election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is our intention to move steadily towards that aim and on that basis I ask the Committee to support the proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is clear from the clause that there will be radical changes in the rent structure. We know that landlords can hoist rents up by 25 per cent., five times the rate of inflation. In future they will be able to double rents, and they will double in many cases. There is no doubt that the Minister's glib phrases about gradual phasing and reducing phasing progressively belie the real intention behind the Bill, that is, to let landlords rip and allow their rents to soar to whatever the market level is. We know from our experience in London of the enormous profits
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0575">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>905</span>
that are to be made from tenants in private rented accommodation. Horrific rents are charged in London, and some of my honourable Friends have referred to those.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the same time as allowing rents to soar, the Government are cutting housing benefit. They are to cut it in a fortnight's time in one of a series of cuts, and they will ensure that people are moved out of their properties if housing benefit officers believe that the rents are too high to be subsidised. The real impact of the clause will be not just to double the rent burden on private tenants but to increase homelessness. The Government's aim is clear here—at the same time as allowing landlords to make the biggest possible profit, they wish to ensure that people are forced into some of the worst housing, in damp, leaking, empty council houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister claims that there are plenty of empty council houses. We know that there are thousands which are rotting with damp; there are tens of thousands which are leaking like sieves, there are many empty, near-derelect, run-down council houses. That is the new market into which the Minister is seeking to force tenants in the private sector who can no longer pay their rents. That means that many tenants will have no choice. As landlords hoist up the rents under the clause, some tenants will pay—those in work, while others will move out and look for alternative accommodation will just worry themselves to an early grave.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Older tenants who are hammered by housing benefit cuts and are under pressure from landlords with highly attractive inner-city properties have no hope of obtaining suitable housing from the council in the vicinity of the inner city. They are the tenants who are least able to cope with the pressures that the clause and the Bill will put on them. They are the ones who have least in the way of physical and cash resources, and to whom the Bill will cause considerable worry and anxiety, driving many to an early grave.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has a colour-coded brief, and he appeared to stumble on one or two occasions when following it. The red is perhaps "Rubbish" and the yellow for "Useless". He has put up a pathetic case. The clause will bring chaos to the private rented sector, with private tenants not knowing whether to accede to demands for higher rents—rents which will go up no just 25 per cent. but which will double and more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, rents can double within four years. Under the clause they can double overnight. That is the chaos that will arise, as people move out of private sector housing and present themselves to local councils as homeless, as a record number have done under this Government. That is the future that stares us in the face, and why? It is because the Government seek to represent a small minority in Scotland—a few private landlords and those who lobby on their behalf. The real intention of the clause is to allow people to make a profit out of other people's housing misery. That is main reasons why we oppose the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>906</span>
The Minister recognises that this is the end product. Why else will he allow phasing to be abolished almost overnight? Why else will he put a five-year deadline on the Secretary of State's right to intervene? He has not said how much the Secretary of State will intervene on when, but we all know that that will be governed not by human but by electoral considerations. The Secretary of State is trying to buy himself time until after the next election, if necessary. Using the clause, the Government will chance their arm. In some cases, they will let rents rise far too rapidly and then, with pious talk, they will cite the Bill and step in, slapping some of the worst landlords over the wrist. However, they will ensure that, either before the next election or shortly after it, the private landlord sector in Scotland will have the same free range as it had under housing benefit, when it made massive profits and caused massive suffering. The Government have been happy to shell out millions of pounds to private landlords—and to property speculators, if Edinburgh is anything to go by—who are in this market only to make enormous profits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have seen the chaos that has been brought to housing benefit. We have seen the people who profited and we know that millions of people suffered. We also know that they delayed until after the last election the changes in housing benefit that we see now: further cuts that mean that 1 million pensioners and many hundreds of thousands of families will lose out. We know that they are good at enacting legislation or regulations just after an election, and we can predict therefore that the Minister is giving a five-year time scale this morning to ensure that if things go as badly wrong as we believe they will with the Bill and the clause, they have a get-out clause for themselves; something that will postpone the day of judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can tell the Minister, with sadness but confidence, that that day of reckoning will not be in five years' time and will not be at the next election. The day of reckoning will come to many of those families within the next months and years, and the Minister and the Government will have to face the consequences.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once again, the Minister has confirmed most of our worst suspicions about the Government's plans. Under the circumstances, not much can be achieved by pursuing the amendments. My inclination would be to vote against the whole principle of the clause. As it stands it is unimprovable. The Minister has said that he stands by the principle of the clause, which is that all restrictions on the rate of increase of rents should be lifted. They only comfort that he has been able to offer is that it might be phased in six-monthly stages over perhaps five years, and at the end of five years it will go.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister had the gall to talk about the Government's objectives on inflation. Under the present restrictions, rents can be increased by as much as 25 per cent. per year, which is way above the present level of inflation. It is higher than the highest ever rate of inflation back in 1975. I do not know what landlord are whinging about in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0576">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>907</span>
They can increase their return over and above the rate of inflation anyway. The Minister wants to allow them to go even further with a six-monthly phasing. That is at the same time as trade unions are being urged to enter into long-term negotiating agreements with their employers—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Wage cuts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And wage packages lasting for over three years. They did not get away with it at Ford—there it was two years. Employees and wage earners are to be restricted to wage increases over a two-year period, yet the Government are prepared to sanction increases in rents of over 25 per cent. and perhaps at only six-monthly intervals. How on earth can the Minister talk about the control of inflation in the very same speech in which he is cheerfully taking the lid off rent increases and saying that that most fundamental aspect of people's household budget, their rent, should be allowed to increase without any restriction at all, goodness knows when but within the next five years?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already quoted the figures that apply at present. The Minister has told me in a parliamentary answer that the average registered rent for private unfurnished accommodation rose from £3.50 per house per week in 1979–80 to £16.29 per house per week in 1986–87—an increase of 365 per cent. That was new registered rents. Clearly, if they had been sitting tenants, that would not have been possible, because that is far more than 25 per cent. a year. The dynamic affecting the housing market is clear enough—it is forcing rents up at a very disturbing rate, and we know that many tenants cannot afford those levels of rent increases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What does the Minister say about that? He says, "Don't worry, the housing benefit system is still there." We intend to have a real go about housing benefit on clause 64, but the consultation document to which the Minister referred, and which deals with this aspect of the legislation, interestingly includes a number of provisions that were not included in the White Paper, which was published within a week of the consultation document. Therefore, it must be said that the Government were being underhand—to put it generously—or dishonest—to put it more accurately perhaps—in issuing a White Paper that purported to put out what they think are the more attractive aspects of their housing policy, while their policy of doing away with phasing was kept in a closed-tight, technical consultation document that came out with much less publicitiy about a week later. Now the Government are seeking to legislate on that proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no guarantee in any of the suggestions in the consultation document that housing benefit claimants will be fully protected against that law. On the contrary. I have already quoted from paragraphs 13 and 14 of the consultation document. Paragraph 13 makes it clear that regardless of what the rent registration process may do, a landlord will still be perfectly free to try to get a higher rent if he can. Paragraph 14 states:
	<span class='label label-info column'>908</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is proposed that once a maximum rent has been set for housing benefit subsidy purposes there will be a period of probably a year during which no increase in that rent will be considered for subsidy purposes, even if there is a change of tenant, unless it can be demonstrated that there has been a material change in the condition of the dwelling or the terms of the tenancy."</p></blockquote>
If the rent gets shoved up under this provision, and the tenant cannot afford the rent, there is no way in which the local authority that pays out the housing benefit will be compensated for any additional payment of housing benefit that it may make to tenants who get hammered in that way. It is not good enough for the Minister to say, "Don't worry. The housing benefit system will protect people who face hardship as a consequence of this legislation." It will not. It cannot. Indeed, when we come to clause 64 we shall find that where landlords are too greedy it will not be the landlords who will be penalised; it will be the tenants, because their housing benefit will be cut.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have dealt with some clauses in which the Minister has sought to bring in what he describes as new legislative provisions to prevent unlawful eviction—homelessness—and to prevent harassment. What utter hypocrisy to do that in the same Bill in which there is a clause like this. If that is not harassment and if it will not lead to homelessness and evictions because tenants cannot afford the rate of rent increases that are being proposed, I do not know what is. That is about the most sickening and depressing aspect of the Bill that we have stumbled into yet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say "stumbled because that appears to be exactly what the Government have done. It was not in the consultation document, it was not in the White Paper. It was put in as an afterthought, without any consultation. The Bill must have been published about a week after consultation document came out, so it is no good the Minister talking about consultation on this. There has been no consultation. The chartered surveryors and their friends have been leaning on the Secretary of State and they have got exactly what they wanted. Tenants, housing authorities, Shelter or anyone else concerned about the provision of rented housing in Scotland have not been consulted about this. It is all to do with encouraging private landlords to make profits. The Minister quite palpably has not taken any reasonable steps to protect tenants on low incomes from the consequences of the removal of this restriction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fundamental point is that what is being taken away is a pretty flimsy protection. It does not go very far under the present circumstances. All it does is to prevent a landlord increasing a rent to a tenant by more than 25 per cent. per year. It is outrageous that a landlord should be allowed to think of going as far as that. The Government evidently think that it is worthwhile taking away even that minimal restriction and saying that landlords can double or treble rents if they want to, and no one will stop them. They are in the business of encouraging a free market in rented housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that it is a sellers' market because of the crying need for more decent housing to rent in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0577">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>909</span>
right place in Scotland. If landlords have property available to let, clearly people will be clamouring to get it. They may be prepared to sign documents committing themselves to rents and conditions that in their saner moments they would not contemplate. Because they are so desperate to get a decent roof over the heads of their families, they are prepared to accept intolerable conditions. That is bad enough, but six months later the landlord will be allowed to put up the rent by any percentage that comes into his head. The Government's suggestion is intolerable. There is little to be gained from pursuing the amendments. Labour Members are opposed to the principle of removing rent restrictions. I urge my honourable Friends to vote against clause 38.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like some clarification from the Minister about the procedure. He has told the Committee that he has it in mind to exercise the power under the clause at six-monthly intervals over a period of five years. If that is so, does it mean that he is bringing forward orders to do that in a one-off? In other words, will he introduce a statutory instrument that flows from the primary legislation setting out that timetable for all time coming, giving a framework of increases and a timetable over a period of years thereafter? Or, as I suspect is more likely, will he come every six months to Parliament to set up a regime of time scales and limit increases over the following six months? If it is the latter, he is producing an enormous potential for confusion. From one day to the next, twice a year, as the period changes, there will be new rates and new periods. The potential for confusion is very great.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More especially, the Minister must have some idea of the steps by which he will change the provisions of sections 33 and 58 over the five-year period. Will they be equal or increasing steps? Will he make big steps at the beginning and small steps at the end? He must have some idea about the rate of disapplication of sections 33 and 58. It would help the Committee and those outside who study these matters if he would tell us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I subscribe to many of the arguments that were made earlier. I am no friend of the clause, but if the Government are determined to proceed down this road, it would help the Committee to know how far and how fast the regime will proceed at these six-monthly intervals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that there is no secrecy about the clause, but there is a question of mandate. This is a unitary Parliament. The Government won election to that unitary Parliament and the right to legislate the terms of defence and foreign affairs, which affect all parts of the United Kingdom. Here, we are dealing with something specifically Scottish, that is Scottish housing, which is different from that elsewhere in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The full weight of opinion in Scotland is opposed not only to the Bill as a whole but to clauses like this. I am not referring only to party political opinion in the Labour party, the Liberal party, the Social Democratic party and the Scottish National party, whom most Scottish voters support, compared to the one out of four who support the Conservative party.
	<span class='label label-info column'>910</span>
All the bodies involved in Scottish housing, the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations, Shelter and COSLA, are opposed to the Bill. The only people on whom the Government can draw to support the Bill and their narrowly based political party in Scotland are the landlords and their professional associates, the chartered surveyors. By what right are the Government imposing clauses of this kind on the people of Scotland and the tenants of Scottish housing associations? It seems to me that they have no right whatsoever.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister promised to phase out the phasing of rent increases. He said it as if it represented a great favour to Scottish tenants. It was almost as if he were saying to them "You should be grateful to me for making you pay more over a shorter period of time, because I could make you pay even more right away." That is an absurd position for the Minister to try to defend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has said that the time over which rent increases can be phased in will be changed from a year to six months and that it will be done nearly five years before phasing is completely abolished. He will have to explain that in much greater detail. The honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) was absolutely right. That kind of information is insufficient to tell the Committee what the impact of the change is likely to be. Does the Minister mean, for example, that every six months, 25 per cent. rent increases will be allowed? If he is not saying that, he will have to explain to the Committee exactly what he is saying. Increases every six months for the next 10 six-month periods will take us up to five years and then they will suddenly stop. The Minister has not explained in detail what the Government intend to do in this phasing out process and what they are asking the Committee to support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that all Opposition Members will oppose the Minister's proposal, but I should have thought that Conservative Members, particularly the honourable Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker), who claims to be concerned about tenants, especially those in the private sector, would seek clarification on this issue. Otherwise he will be agreeing to something when he does not even know what impact it will have on those whom he represents. It is surprising that he has remained silent all morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

the honourable Gentleman should understand that we are introducing the Bill because we have every right to do so. We won the election to this Parliament.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has a direct connection with the clause, you will be pleased to hear, Mr. Lambie.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I thought that the intervention of the honourable Member for Tayside, (Mr. Walker) was about mandates. It was perhaps wrong of me to allow him to respond to the goading from the honourable Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAHion). We must go back to the clause, because I am hoping to have the vote before 1 o'clock.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my honourable Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAHion) for giving way. It is my understanding that the Conservative party in Scotland included in its manifesto—I am advised of this by Shelter—a commitment to continue to empower local authorities to refer rents to rent officers. That implies that the Conservative party was supporting rent controls at that stage. Of course it lost the election in Scotland, so it might be said that it had been defeated on that principle. That may be how the Government justify their present proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what Ministers in the Tory party in Scotland think is the only sales point. The vast majority of voters in Scotland rejected their fumblings and meanderings before the last election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that there would be no possibility of intolerable rent increases as a result of the clause. He said, for example, that they would continue to be controlled by the registration process for fair rents and by rent officers, although he could not say at what pace they might occur in the future. He said that in the past, rents had gone up by about 19 per cent. every three years. It is comforting to know that the increase will be only 19 per cent. and that it will be phased in over three years. The Minister is now asking us to take his word that it will go up by something similar, but he cannot tell us how
	<span class='label label-info column'>912</span>
much it will go up over the next three years or at what pace the increase will be phased in. It is not good enough for the Minister to try to persuade the Committee to accept that proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that even now, rent levels in the housing association sector are significantly above those in the local authority sector. The Minister must address himself to that point. We also know that future rent levels are likely to be controlled by the level of grant to housing associations. What assurances can the Minister give the Committee that those grants will be maintained to allow housing associations to continue to limit rent increases to their existing tenants?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that housing association rents would be below the market level and that there would be a system of affordable rents. What does "affordable" mean? What the Minister can afford is not necessarily what a pensioner or a single unemployed person can afford. The Minister, who has been able to afford whatever he liked throughout his life, must remember that some people cannot afford the rent levels likely to be asked under the Bill. His assurances that rents will be affordable are not worth anything. The Committee should pay no attention to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that, because inflation was low, the Government were phasing out the phasing in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Now you see it, now you don't!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the Minister's idea, not mine. If inflation goes up, will the Minister come back to Parliament and say that he will phase rents in again? He has not addressed himself to that problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was speaking to my neighbour, who is a pensioner, at the weekend and she said that she could not understand why Conservative Members appear on the television or in the press saying that inflation is coming down. It may be going down in terms of the retail prices index, but it is not going down in terms of the living costs of pensioners, unemployed people and others. For them, inflation is raging ahead. The Minister is suggesting that it will continue to rage even further and faster in the future because of clause 38.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

If the Committee wants to discuss a matter it can do so.
