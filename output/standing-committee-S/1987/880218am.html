	<div class='title'>SHORT ASSURED TENANCIES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>On proposed [16 February],</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>On again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Committee was interrupted on Tuesday night I was emphasising the irrelevance of the short assured tenancy as a means of tackling the housing problems in Scotland. The homeless and the inadequately housed have nothing to gain from tenancies that will initially give security of tenure for six months but, thereafter, will allow the landlord to evict the tenants. It is important to grasp the seriousness of the lack of security of tenure under short assured tenancies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Tuesday, the Minister repeatedly referred to his hope—as there was no evidence for the point that he was trying to stress, it could only be a fond hope—that rents under short assured tenancies would be lower than those under assured tenancies. He took great comfort from that hope, as it gave him reason to believe that landlords would not, as we allege, continually and predominantly let their property on short assured tenancies in preference to assured tenancies. The Minister claimed that the higher rent regime would be sufficient incentive for landlords to opt for assured tenancies. That claim does not bear examination because it fails to recognise the fundamental link between security of tenure and the rents likely to be demanded by landlords.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fear of dispossession nullifies any legal rights that tenants might have to fair rents or to apply to rent assessment committees for rent determination. Clause 31 gives tenants in short assured tenancies the right to make such an application, but that right is subject to clause 25 (4) which states:
	<br><q><p>"unless the landlord and the tenant otherwise agree, the rent determined by the committee shall be the rent under the tenancy".</p></q>
The critical phrase is:
	<br><q><p>"unless the landlord and the tenant otherwise agree".</p></q>
That provides a loophole that will enable landlords to insist upon an agreement. That is tantamount to landlords imposing on tenants settlements with which they do not agree, but which, because of their in security, they will be forced to accept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister might argue that few landlords would exploit the situation to impose unjustifiable rents on frightened tenants. However, the Minister has refused to impose an upper limit in the duration of short assured tenancies and there are landlords in Scotland who will use the Bill not as the Government
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>784</span>
wish, but to obtain the maximum advantage for themselves. Landlords will be able to continue short assured tenancies ad infinitum yet be able to get round the rent assessment committee provisions by frightening tenants with eviction to secure agreement to higher rents than would be reasonable under such tenancies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister tells us that rents will be lower under short assured tenancies than under assured tenancies, but he has not understood that lack of security of tenure will enable landlords to frighten tenants so that they will not avail themselves of their rights. Even if the Minister believes that such cases will be the exception, he must surely accept that control of exceptional behaviour is the purpose of legislation. The Committee must be certain that the Bill will deal with any possible abuse. I do not believe that the Minister has recognised that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Committee votes to allow landlords to use their strength to force higher rents upon tenants than would be possible under strict interpretation of the Bill, we shall be as guilty as those who perpetrate such exploitation. We must be fully aware of the implication of what we do. I hope that all Ministers who wish to have a clear conscience will vote to make such exploitation impossible. I ask the Minister to take this matter seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister justifies the clause on the basis that 130,000 houses in Scotland are not currently let. He tells us that two thirds of them are in the private sector. Is he seriously suggesting that those houses are not on the market because landlords do not have available to them short assured tenancies which would allow the properties to be let for six-monthly periods only? That appears to be his only argument. He has given us no evidence that 90,000 houses will flood back on to the housing market if short assured tenancies are available. The Minister will have to persuade us by substantiating his claim that the bulk of the houses in the private sector are not on the market today because of the lack of short assured tenancies. Throughout our sittings the Minister has repeatedly made claims and allegations which he has failed to substantiate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that some Conservative Members take the Bill seriously, listen to debates and worry about loopholes that will allow exploitation. The hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn) is one and I am sure that he is aware that the Minister's argument that the Bill provides reduced security of tenure in exchange for lower rents does not stand up. Because of the loophole, tenants could be frightened by the prospect of eviction into not appealing under the provisions in the Bill. We must not allow short assured tenancies to be part of the Bill until we close the loophole that allows unscrupulous landlords to use pressure against tenants who are in a weaker position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Fairbairn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Perth and Kinross)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with care to the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion), who has not, so far as I can see, tabled any amendment that will close the imagined loophole that he has found. The hon. Gentleman asked the Minister for an assurance that clause 29 would bring two thirds of the empty houses in Scotland on to the market. It will bring them on to the market, but one can never predict what preference people will take. People invent new motor
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0511">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>785</span>
cars in the hope that they will sell, but they cannot predict whether people will decide to buy them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are reasons for houses being empty. A landlord knows that, if he rents out his house under present legislation, whatever the tenant may say with regard to the ish of the lease, the tenants at the prospective ish of the lease can just say "Well, I'm staying here." Unless one can establish very limited criteria—for example that one needs the house for another agricultural employee or some other such limited condition—recovery of property is almost impossible. A landlord will not let a person have a house in the knowledge that the landlord cannot get it back when he wants it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause will sweep away that artificial restriction. The Opposition seem to say that if a person enters into a contract to lease a house for six months or a year, or whatever it may be, at the termination of that time he should not expect to have to keep his word and that in some way he is being turned out. If I lend someone my car for six weeks, at the end of that time he may say "Oh, I need it all summer. Just because I agreed to hire it for six weeks does not mean that I am not going to keep it. You are depriving me of a motor car." That seems to be the argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. and learned Gentleman appreciate the important distinction between the convenience of having a motor car in which to move around and the fundamental human requirement to have a home for oneself and one's family? Is there not a quality distinction between those two types of property? Surely Parliament should protect a Scot's right to live with his own family in his own home.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, I shall give another illustration. Any contract that is freely entered into for a limited period does not give the right of one party at the termination of that limited period to abolish and ignore that particular clause in the contract, which is what the Opposition seem to suggest. They seem to suggest that a person can give his word to the landlord that he is hiring the house for a year and at the end of the year say, "Oh, you are putting me out of my home." The fact that he entered into an agreement and gave his word that he would stay for a year and no longer does not seem to apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) said that for a family living with parents to take a short assured tenancy was to move out of the frying pan into the fire. I stayed in his house when he was living with his parents, and it was no frying pan, although there were certain potty characteristics about some members of the family. Nor do I remember his revered parents or the great Paxton house as having any characteristics of a cooking utensil. That may just be the hon. Gentleman's domestic resentment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a young married couple have to live with their parents, the clause gives the opportunity not to do so while they look for a permanent or another house. It gives them the opportunity, since there will be so many houses on the market, to have a tenants' market rather than a landlords' market. The ability to rent a house without becoming a serf of the local
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>786</span>
authority or without having to stay on a housing list and live in overcrowded conditions with one's parents is one that the Scottish people have lacked for far too long. Because of restrictive legislation passed by the Labour Government, people have had to live in overcrowded conditions with their parents. That is frequently the cause of the unhappiness in marriage in later times—the stressful beginning when young people cannot have a house of their own, as the clause provides for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the aversion of the hon. Member for East Lothian to short assured tenancies, but I should have thought that that was because the assurance of his short tenancy on the Front Bench was very likely. I understand that he would much prefer that the assurance was longer rather than shorter, as those behind him demonstrate their grasp of the subject with much greater quality and credibility than he does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, people starting off in marriage or in work will be able to move, to rent accommodation, to settle down. I know of hundreds of cases in Perthshire and Kinross-shire where people simply cannot take a job because they cannot get a short assured tenancy. This is one of the most civilised improvements that we can make for those young people who are seeking a home in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Doran 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I address myself to the question whether the clause should stand part of the Bill, I should like to place one small point on the record. The Opposition have made a great deal of the fact that the only way that the Government could start the Committee was by bringing in two English Members who have no connection at all with Scotland and even less knowledge of the housing scene in Scotland. We have been particularly critical of the hon. Member for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Arbuthnot), even to the extent of giving him the nickname "Woodstock"—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has sought to establish his Scottish credentials by revealing to the Committee that his grandmother was a tenant of the grandmother of my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson), but I learned yesterday that he has even closer connections with Scotland. We had assumed that the name Arbuthnot had no Scottish connections at all, but I gather that the Arbuthnots have held lands in Kincardineshire for some nine centuries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am interested in the ancestors of the hon. Member for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Arbuthnot) but I do not think that it is under discussion. We are dealing with clause 29, as amended. The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Lambie. Surely it is not in order when discussing clause 29 stand part for an hon. Member who voted on the

Inner London Education Authority proposals, about which he knows absolutely nothing, to criticise the ethnic origins of another hon. Member.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not criticising the ethnic origins of an hon. Member. I simply wanted it to be recorded that the hon. Member for Wanstead and Woodford appears to have Scottish connections. I gather that the name Arbuthnot has a Gaelic root which, translated literally, means "marsh of the silly felow". That should be put on the record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Although it is not strictly in order, I must give the hon. Gentleman a chance to reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arbuthnot</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The name Arbuthnot does have a Gaelic root—Aberbothenoth—but luckily that has been changed. I have been doing some research myself and am delighted to reveal that I am as Scottish as most members of the Committee and considerably more so than the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson). I have discovered that we share a common ancestor, who unfortunately was crucified in Edinburgh market place in 1681. I have also discovered that, although I have seven eighths Scottish blood, he has at least three sixteenths English blood in his ancestry plus a person called Lieutenant-General Arthur Van Notten-Pole, who does not sound altogether Scottish. The hon. Gentleman criticises my Scottish ancestry. Perhaps he should examine his own family tree. That is certainly what I shall be doing next.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Now that we have cleared up these various points, I should point out that the only true Scots are the working-class Scots—the aristocrats came from England and France.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the record, I was not criticising. It was not a pre-planned double act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are addressing whether the clause should stand part of the Bill. There will be serious difficulties if it does and becomes the law in Scotland. The housing market in Scotland will be distorted by the creation of this new tenancy. The concept of the short assured tenancy has not been properly thought through. The inconsistencies were picked out earlier by Opposition Members. The impression was given by the Minister, and by the Government previously, that these tenancies could continue on a six-monthly basis. That was the level on which they would operate. Clearly, that is not how they will work. There will be serious distortions in the housing market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We run the risk of seeing litigation on a grand scale. At present the assured tenancy and the short assured tenancy need not be established in writing or formally. The landlord need only hand over the keys and the tenant hand over the rent and take occupancy. It escapes me why that should subsist. I appreciate the fact that the Minister assured us that he would reconsider the point, but there is potential for dispute about the type of tenancy. By exchanging our names, deeds and money, have we created a short assured tenancy or an assured tenancy? Who will determine that, if there is no written contract or lease?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>788</span>
Will the court take the landlord's word or the tenant's? I can see the argument for both sides. I can imagine the muddle that we shall get into. There are no guidelines or parameters if there is no contract. That point needs to be established.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the prospect also of increased and substantial pressure on existing local authority services. I believe that, if the short assured tenancy takes root in Scotland, it will be the form of tenancy used by the least privileged and most vulnerable section of the community, because that group will be unable to obtain any other kind of tenancy. It does not add anything substantially to the Scottish housing market or scene. These people will be put at risk. They can be moved out at any time and will be subject to the whims of landlords once the initial six months are up. Substantial pressure will be put on Scottish housing authorities and social work departments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the House passed the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act 1977, a great deal of the debate and discussion was on the problem of children coming into care. It was accepted by all sides that it was wrong for children to be taken into care simply because their parents did not have adequate accommodation. We are in danger of seeing a return to that situation, with inordinate pressure put on social work departments because of the distortions created in the market by the way in which people are moved around at the whim of landlords. Local authorities do not have the available houses to operate properly and fulfil their obligations under the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act or the 1987 Act, which is now the relevant legislation. The measure is bound to put pressure on social work departments. Clearly, the Government have not considered that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The measure has not been properly thought through. It is clear that the Bill has been in gestation in the Department of the Environment for a considerable time. It is a purely English measure; there is very little about it that is Scottish. My concern is that the thinking has been less about what impact the measure will have on Scottish housing and more about the ideology behind the Bill. Throughout the debates on this part of the Bill we have heard the Minister give explanations about the justification—that it will improve the quality of Scottish housing, free landlords of the shackles of rent restrictions, bring hundreds of thousands of houses back on to the market and improve the choice of tenants. Rubbish! It can do none of that. The measure has not been properly thought through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only people who will be daft enough or desperate enough to take a short assured tenancy will be those who cannot get a tenancy anywhere else. They will be the people who cannot get a local authority house; who will not be accepted by a private landlord in any other circumstances and who cannot afford to buy a house. That is not flexibility or expanding the market; it is distorting the market. There is no logic in it whatsoever. If this clause is passed, we shall provide a means whereby these weak and vulnerable people are further exploited and put at risk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I was considering what I would say, I tried to put myself in the Government's position and apply their ideology. I tried to think what logic there could be in creating this system. I found it difficult to find the logic. The Minister has boasted about the protections that are available to local authority
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0513">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>789</span>
tenants. The Government are proud—in some respects, rightly—of the provisions in the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Act 1980, which gave local authority tenants rights that they did not have previously. I applaud the Government for that. I am already on the record as saying taht I regret that my party did not take the same initiative. I disagreed, and still disagree, with the sale of council houses, but I approve wholeheartedly of tenants' rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When flicking through the consolidated legislation, the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987, one sees in the rubric expressions such as
	<br><q><p>"Tenant's right of recourse to sheriff … Tenant's right to written lease … Succession to secure tenancy".</p></q>
That hammers home the rights of council tenants. On top of that is the right to buy a house. I do not understand why the Government see no need to give such protection to tenants in the private sector. They are giving no incentive to tenants to be flexible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can accept that there may be logic—although I do not accept the principle—in trying to equalise the market. There may be sense in saying that bumping up the rents of council houses to get them to an economic level on a par with rents in the private sector will create a fiexibile market where there can be interchange. If I decided that I wanted to rent a house, I could freely and with some security choose to rent a private house because I thought that I could get good housing at an economic cost and would be secure in that tenancy. Under the Bill I cannot do that; I do not have freedom of choice. Anyone with half a brain in his head would be daft to consider a short assured tenancy unless he was desperate. There is no incentive for anyone who is looking for ordinary housing to take that form of tenancy. It will cater only for the bottom end of the market—for people who are desperate and have nowhere else to go. It is a fallacy to say that it will open up the market. I am mindful of the comments of the Minister and other Conservative Members, but they are wildly wrong—the Bill will do nothing to improve the availability of housing Scotland. It will create a ghetto situation; thee will be ghetto landlords and ghetto tenants—desperate people who have nowhere else to go for housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not for any Government to legislate for narrow sectional interests. I believe that the Government are wrong in thinking that, by removing the restrictions which presently tie landlords down to what I consider to be civilised controls, they will create a new situation. The Government are legislating because of ideology, not for the housing needs of Scotland. It will be a long time before the effects of this half-baked legislation are seen.

It is thoroughly bad legislation and, like any legislation based on dogma, it is created by blindness, and it will fail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) has made an interesting speech, but it will not surprise him to know that I do not agree with much of what he said. The Labour party never learns. Its members think that the market place operates effectively only when
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>790</span>
they control it by putting impediments on things happening. Many properties stood empty so long because there was no incentive for people to let properties. In the absence of such an incentive, properties stood empty and many people were denied the opportunity of a short-term tenancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a need in the market place for such tenancies. Anyone who thinks there is not has never moved around because of his job and never gone to a new place to work and tried to find a place where he could move his family temporarily—for six months perhaps. I have had to do that on a number of occasions in my career, and I was always delighted to be able to get a short-term tenancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths) may think that funny but my career merits looking at. I am not in the least ashamed of what I have done in my lifetime. I hope that when the hon. Gentleman reaches my age he can look back and feel just as satisfied that he has actually achieved something.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was suggested earlier that only the working class appear to be true Scots. I am not sure whether I fall into that category. If being working class depends on whether my father worked, I do. If it means that my grandfather and my great-grandparents worked, I wonder, because they were people of substance and wealth. The fact that my grandfather joined the Army and was cut off meant that my father did not enjoy the delights that the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) presently enjoys because he did not have that difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can check my ancestry back for many hundreds of years. My ancestors were all Scots. I have no qualms about saying that I believe that clause 29 will be beneficial to those who are looking for short-term tenancies. If it is suggested that someone is daft because he takes a short-term tenancy—as the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South did—we must ask whether it is daft to take a better job, whether it is daft to seek better opportunities in life, whether it is daft for a person to give his children things that he did not enjoy? That is what many people do. It is normal to move into an area for a short period while one looks for more permanent accommodation. When moving to a new job from another part of the country, it is rare for a person immediately to find a suitable property to buy. He has to see what the schools and the other facilities in the area are like. [	<i>Interruption</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not funny. I can remember twice in my lifetime buying very expensive houses to make sure that my children were in the catchment area for the best schools. I can tell hon. Members who think that that is not the thing to do, that it is what most people who move around do. That is what sensible people do. They put the interests of their families first, so they find a place where they can live together as a family temporarily for six months, then look around to find a house in the area that suits them best. There will therefore be a market for short-term tenancies in that segment of the market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other people will want to move into properties for a short period. Young couples who have just got married may, for their own reasons, want to be flexible and have a short-term tenancy while they

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>791</span>
look around. That is better than living with in-laws. It is madness to have houses standing empty. If there is any ideological block, it is that Opposition Members are unable to see what the Government are attempting to do. I do not pretend that this will solve the problems of the market place—one narrow clause could never do that—but neither will it create all the problems of the market place. The market does not work that way. Many people would, however, be able to have homes for short periods.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have some experience of people moving to north Tayside looking for jobs. Some of them went there when the oil boom started. They preferred to live in my constituency because they thought that the schools were good, or that the facilities, such as skiing and other activities, provided a good reason for living there. Many of them moved into holiday accommodation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My experience, representing the city of Aberdeen, is quite different. People moved to north Tayside and other areas simply because there was no housing available in the Aberdeen area. They had no option but to move outside.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman keeps making my point. I am astonished that the hon. Gentleman, who represents a city, does not realise that in cities there are many people who are desperate to find short-term accommodation, for a variety of reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for East Lothian shakes his head, but as I said earlier, he has no experience of what it is like to move around trying to create a career. He does not know what it is like to move to a new town or city because one has the opportunity of advancement and promotion. When one gets the chance one takes it, but it is a chance. Anyone who takes a job with a new company risks not being good enough for the job, so a short-term tenancy is often the answer to his housing problem. If he does not make it in the first six months with the new company, he will never make it. People who get promotion and do not make it may find that they are out on their ear. That happens. It is the risk that people take when they accept new challenges and opportunities. Not everyone works in the safety of a sinecure in local government or public service where jobs are guaranteed. Most people who start from humble origins and reach the top do so in the private sector where the risks and opportunities are greater. Because the risks are greater, those individuals want short-term tenancies. They do not want to put down roots permanently. After all, the house they move into may not be in the right place, or it may tie them in a way they do not want. If they do not make the grade in their new job, they do not want to be lumbered with having to sell a second house, since they may not have sold the one from which they moved in the first place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Aberdeen, South will long be remembered as the man who said that anyone who took a six-month tenancy was daft. If he thinks that that will not be quoted to him again and again, I am sorry to tell him that it will be. Everyone in that situation is not desperate. I accept that some may be desperate and that some will behave foolishly. There is no Way we can legislate to prevent people behaving

The greater the range that is on offer in the market place, the better the market works. Because of the absence of range and choice in the market place, many properties stood empty and many people were without houses. That is the policy of the mad house.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members wanted to know what evidence there was of demand for short assured tenancies. I shall give them one piece of evidence they will approve of—the Shelter rural housing initiative to bring empty houses back into use in Scotland. In co-operation with local authorities, Shelter discovers empty premises and finds out who owns them. It follows the matter up, and the premises are improved with improvement grants, and homeless persons are often accommodated. That is a highly successful project which is funded by the Scottish Office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the Minister has said something about the rural housing project, because I am fairly familiar with it—East Lothian district council is running just such a project.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am saying that when homes are found for homeless persons under this programme, they are often on a temporary basis until permanent accommodation can be found.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has focused on an initiative which he believes to be successful. Will he now tell the Committee that, after the refurbishment of these properties with local authority grants, there are problems in letting those places and that they stand empty because we do not have the short assured tenancies offered by the clause?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to respond to the hon. Gentleman. His line of criticism is precisely that which Opposition Members took during preceedings on the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Bill. They asked how many tenants in the public sector in Scotland would want these rights and how many would take them up. They constantly put forward the argument that relatively few would take up the right to buy. We now know that 106,000 have taken up that right. In the same way, we believe that in this case many of those houses will be brought back into use.

The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) acknowledged that there would be a higher rent for assured tenancies, because the security of tenure is greater.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that it was the hon. Member for Dundee, East who suggested that tenants might be frightened. That is the purpose of clauses 31,33, 34 and 35, which deal with damages for unlawful eviction, the measure of damages and the further offence of harassment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister not understand that tenants are vulnerable? Where they have a choice between using the rights available under the Bill or suffering eviction, they will probably fail to use his rights and be quiet.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly do not agree. That is why we have introduced strengthened rights, which we shall come to later today when we discuss clauses 31, 33, 34 and 35.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn), in an enlightened speech this morning, drew attention to the importance of keeping agreements. The ability to rent a house is one that the Scottish people have learnt because of too restrictive legislation. He stressed that people who are moving to take up jobs want to take up rented accommodation. Similarly, my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) talked on Tuesday evening about the plight of young Scots who want to move to jobs but who are unable to take them up because of a lack of accommodation. It is young people who are moving to jobs who would benefit so much from the short assured tenancies which Opposition Members seem to oppose. These tenancies are also for individuals who wish to set up in business, and agreements will be freely entered into.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause introduces and defines the short assured tenancy. A tenancy will be of the short assured variety if it meets the requirements for an assured tenancy as defined in earlier clauses and if it satisfies
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0516">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>795</span>
two additional tests—that it is for at least six months and that the landlord serves on the tenant before the start of the tenancy a notice stating that the tenancy will be a short assured tenancy. The notice will need to be in the form prescribed by the Secretary of State in regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When a short assured tenancy reaches its expiry date or ish and is not terminated, the landlord and tenant may allow the tenancy to continue by tacit relocation or they may enter into a new contractual tenancy. In either case, the continued or new tenancy will be a short assured tenancy unless the landlord gives the tenant notice that it is not to be. Termination of a short assured tenancy is a different matter and is the subject of the next clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The distinguishing characteristic of the short assured tenancy—as we shall see in clause 30—is that the landlord will have the right to repossess the property at the end of the period of the lease. This will meet the needs of many landlords and tenants: landlords who want to be certain that they will be able to repossess their property at a particular date; and tenants who do not need the indefinite security of tenure that an assured tenancy will confer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North has already correctly explained to the Committee that this is precisely the kind of let which many tenants would be extremely happy to take up but which is simply not available under the present system. Many tenants have lost all practical freedom of choice, but the Government are determined to restore choice to tenants, and clause 29 will be a major means of doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our debate on Tuesday evening, the hon. Member for East Lothian described the short assured tenancy as a "landlords' dream". I can only take that remark to mean that he agrees with what we have been saying all along: that the short assured tenancy will be attractive to landlords who want to be sure of being able to get their property back when they need it but are prepared to let it meantime, even if that means receiving a lower rent than under an assured tenancy. Indeed, if words mean anything, describing the short assured tenancy as a "dream" suggests that the hon. Gentleman would go even further than we have. He must believe that that kind of tenancy would attract many tenants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is utterly naive if he assumes that landlords are always motivated by the interests of tenants to make accommodation available on the basis that suits the tenants. Landlords will look after their self-interest. It is not so much a landlords' dream as a landlords' charter, and it is a charter that will be used against the interests of the tenants. The Minister is responsible for looking after the interests of tenants. He should start to live up to that responsibility and do something about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The hon. Member for East Lothian said that the short assured tenancy must be a landlords' dream. That shows without any question that he believes that there will be an increase in the number of houses available for letting on this form of tenancy. As has already been explained, there are already a great number of tenants who seek such a tenancy. Even on the hon. Gentleman's own analysis, the provisions of clause 29 will have a significant impact, for example, on the problem of people who cannot move to jobs because they cannot find suitable accommodation in the area where the jobs are. They will have a significant impact on homelessness, either directly or by releasing other properties for let that have been vacated by tenants who have seized this new

If the hon. Gentleman wants to contribute after my comments, he is welcome to do so and I will come back on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The essence of the provision is that it will release more houses, either directly or indirectly, yet despite that fact—which the hon. Member for East Lothian believes, as we have acknowledged—we are faced with something that is largely beyond rational explanation. The clause—which will undoubtedly be a "landlords' dream" and will greatly increase the supply of rented accommodation and make a significant contribution to alleviating the problems of homelessness and the unavailability of rented accommodation—is, in the words of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South, to be "struck from the Bill". Members of the Committee will naturally ask how this can possibly be. I suggest that the answer is simple, but depressing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members like to pose as the champions of the homeless and the guardians of the rights of tenants, yet they have not a single positive proposal to put forward that would further these aims. Clause 29, by contrast, will achieve precisely what Opposition Members merely talk about. It seems that they prefer dogma to practical action. They are determined that, if tenants cannot have the kind of tenancy that suits their notions of old-fashioned Socialism, people shall have no private tenancies at all. That idea has already been abandoned by many local authorities under the control of the Labour party, but it has apparently not been abandoned by Labour Members, who cannot get past the ideas of 30 or 50 years ago. They have forgotten nothing, and they have learned nothing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>798</span>
The Opposition would rather see thousands of people continuing to be homeless and living in properties that are unsatisfactory because of disrepair or overcrowding and continuing to be unable to get the kind of accommodation that they want. They would rather see all that than re-examine the very doctrine which, as we have demonstrated, has so largely contributed to this heartbreaking problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make it clear to all Members of the Committee, and to the people of Scotland that a vote against the clause by a party with no positive solution to Scotland's housing problem will be a vote for doing nothing. It will be a vote against trying to do anything for people in Scotland who cannot find somewhere decent to live. It will be a vote against alleviating the plight of the large number of people who are desperately seeking a house but have no available choice because of the present restrictive rules and laws. It will be a vote against solving the problem of Scotland's housing needs. It will demonstrate that Opposition Members are content to confine themselves to rhetoric and discredited theory.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause may be a landlord's dream, but it will be a tenant's nightmare. What choice will it offer people trapped on housing waiting lists, those facing the prospect of homelessness, or those in overcrowded accommodation, to be able to move into short assured tenancies of a maximum of six months with the possibility of being allowed to stagger on two months at a time after that? It is not good enough for the Minister to say that there will be protection from unlawful eviction. Who will be afraid of unlawful eviction when under this regime landlords will have a list as long as your arm of lawful ways of evicting tenants in Scotland after only six months or after any two month period thereafter. Anyone rash enough to become trapped in a short assured tenancy will face lawful eviction. No amount of suing in the courts or complaints of unlawful eviction will save them from that grim prospect. What sort of choice is that? It

might be attractive to someone who would otherwise have to sleep rough in the streets, but most people struggling in overcrowded accommodation would be ill advised to become involved in such a tenancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard some interesting speeches from the Conservative Back Benches about people's pedigrees which seem to be a Tory obsession, I am disturbed to hear that my parents played host to the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn) at some time in the distant past—I must make some inquiries of my sister about the experience. For the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross to compare the sale of a car with the tenancy of a house shows how out of touch the Tory party is with the needs of people in Scotland. The convenience of being able to get around in a motor car is something that we all value, but it is surely not of the same essential importance as a secure home for a family.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The market place lecturing that we hear fromthe hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) about our lack of understanding of the market, as if housing were a commodity to be bought and sold like any other consumer goods, is uncivilised and immoral. Scots families have the right to live in decent housing with secure tenancies, and the Government are denying them that. The way to achieve that is to ensure that finance is available to the private and public sectors to provide enough houses to let or to buy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is anxious about the 90,000 empty private sector houses in Scotland, and so are we. I see many of them in my constituency and they are often in bad condition. It would be a good thing for that property to be back in circulation, but there are too many irresponsible landlords in Scotland who prefer to allow properties to rot rather than let them to tenants. The Government's answer to that is to bend over backwards to make it even easier and more profitable for such landlords to let their houses. I would be more attracted by the idea of extending the principle of the housing action area procedure to enable local authorities to intervene where concentrations of private sector houses are being allowed to rot. Local authorities should have more scope to use their powers under that procedure to acquire property and to improve and let it. The Government however, prefer to approach the problem another way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Tayside, North also said that it was important that there should be accommodation to let so that young people could move into employment in a new area, but where are all those jobs in Scotland? We live in hope, however, so let us suppose that there were job vacancies in an area in Scotland where, by a happy coincidence there were vacant private sector houses to let. In the first six months, that would be all very well. Young families currently in overcrowded accommodation or on waiting lists elsewhere in Scotland could move into the area and rent the houses, but six months later they might be out on their ears. There will be no protection from eviction, so they could be lawfully evicted. They would have a secure job, but not a secure home. What would happen then? They would become homeless
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>800</span>
and the local authority would have to do something about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The prospectus that the Government have put out does not make sense. It is a cruel delusion and a recipe for a nation of nomads, skipping around from one insecure tenancy to the next, with every sheriffs officer busy dealing with evictions. That cannot make sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the Minister that there are too many empty private sector houses. It is estimated that there are 90,000, but I suspect that there are more. The Minister drew attention to the rural house leasing schemes run by some local authorities including East Lothian district council, in co-operation with Shelter. Is he really suggesting that it is defensible for a local authority to spend many thousands of pounds of public money upgrading an empty house, as is happening under the rural leasing scheme, only to hand it back to the landlord with vacant possession six months later, with no guarantee that he will let it? That abuse has occurred in the past. There should be a requirement that if people take advantage of public money to upgrade their property it must be let and managed responsibly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is a charter for irresponsible and cruel landlords. That is exactly what the Government intend and the Minister should be ashamed of himself. We shall certainly vote against this daft clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Nigel Griffiths 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson), I shouldhave liked to give the Minister credit for something—perhaps merely for being able to read his brief with a straight face, but he could even do that. We heard him give strong evidence that the Government are firmly living in the past, believing that there are thousands—perhaps even hundreds of thousands—of properties out there, with thousands of landlords who own two or more houses, or even private individuals who own a second or third home. Because they do not have assured tenancies under clause 29, they choose to leave their houses standing empty rather than let them. That is a myth. Almost no one who owns two or more houses will let them rot when rent can be gained from them. There is no evidence to back up the Minister. He is living in a political Disneyland. It is clear that the Government are building a housing policy on the foolish fallacy of believing that there are thousands of Dukes of Westminster who have properties, many of which are empty. That is not the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The majority of empty houses to which the Minister referred are in the category that he knows, the rural-type houses. East Lothian district council took part in and firmly championed that welcome initiative. There were other initiatives in Edinburgh. The Government have moved in to prevent councils doing anything about empty houses in the private sector. Hundreds of houses in Edinburgh stand derelict with no hot water or baths; they need only an investment. They need not be demolished. Hundreds of them are in areas like Leith and the city centre. They lie derelict because of the Government's policy to ensure that work on housing action areas was frozen while their priority of giving 90 per cent. Grant

to spivs and speculators was pursued in the early 1980s. Hundreds of properties in Edinburgh and thousands in Scotland lie empty because of Government neglect. Those are the houses that the homeless would dearly like to have if they could be made habitable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many ways clause 29 is irrelevant to tackling the problem. It is not merely a landlord's dream. It is not a tenant's dream, nor does it enhance a tenant's rights. It gives Rachman's rights. We are opposed to it. It means that after six months the landlord can move to increase the rent. What the tenant applies for housing benefit, it may be refused and the landlord is entitled to put him out on the street. The worst type of landlord will work hand in hand with the worst type of Government. Alternatively after six months the tenant may be evicted because he cannot pay the rent or the landlord wants to sell the property. The effect of that eviction would not be to decrease homelessness but to increase it. The whole thrust of clause 29 and other clauses is not to decrease homelessness by bringing back houses into circulation, because those houses do not exist in the form that the Minister thinks. They may have done so 20, 30, 40, 50 or 100 years ago, but not now. The Bill will increase homelessness by ensuring that people who have no choice and are lured into short assured tenancies find themselves coming off the streets and off the homeless list only for six months and then to be thrown back on to the streets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) talked about "choice". It is a word that the Government have hijacked. People do not have a choice if they have the option of a doss house or the street. We know the Tory policies. A few hundred yards from here the Government want to clear out the people whose only habitation at present is under the arches where they sleep in cardboard boxes. They want to make a profit out of them. That philosophy permeates the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister, his civil servants and the Government do not want to listen to the Labour party, which rightly can be accused of being partisan, why do they not listen to the national organisation of the citizens advice bureaux? The Scottish Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux say that because of the inclusion of this clause
	<br><q><p>"there is little incentive for landlords to let other than under short-assured tenancies. SACAB does not believe that this would be desirable."</p></q>
The association believes that the clause will guarantee repossession for the landlord and that if a landlord seeks to push up the rent, the tenants will have almost no choice but to go on to the streets or find some means of paying that higher rent. Changes in housing benefit will remove their right not only to housing benefit, but to a roof over their heads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is at the heart of the clause. It will, after a short period, remove the roofs over the heads of those people who have been offered short assured tenancies. The SACAB does not think that they will be the minority or only a few. It says:
	<br><q><p>"there is little incentive for landlords to let other than under short-assured tenancies."</p></q>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>802</span>
This means that clause 29 becomes the very heart of the Bill and that much else in the Bill become irrelevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition have made a clear case against clause 29. My hon. Friends have demolished the Government's rationale on the clause. They have pointed out that it will increase, not decrease, homelessness and that the Government's analysis of the problems of homelessness neglects all the evidence that they have collected or that has been presented to them by independent bodies. The Government's rationale behind the Bill is not to do anything about homelessness, but to give their few friends, who are private landlords and might benefit from this, a killing at the expense of tremendous human suffering.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make a short contribution to the debate. I apologise for not having heard all of it. I have listened carefully to the arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the clause is pushed to a Division, I shall vote against it, albeit with some reluctance. Although I go along with most of the analysis that has come from Labour Members, I do not go as far as they do. The overstate the case—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]—The Minister says, "On the one hand, on the other hand." Some of the issues have to be finely balanced. It is irresponsible to treat them in extreme ways. He goes to the other extreme, I do not agree with his analysis of the arguments either.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a problem, especially with short tenancies of any sort. The balance has not been achieved in the statutory framework that the Government set out for short assured tenancies. I accept, however, the need to address the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My main worry was expressed a moment ago by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths). The citizens advice bureaux are substantially right in saying that under the Bill there will be a great temptation for landlords to go for nothing other than short assured tenancies. If that happens, the Minister's policy will crumble in his hands. There is a very real fear of that. I would regret that, because there is a need for a short assured tenancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee must keep this matter in perspective. Some of the Opposition's statements do not do that. This part of the Bill will relate only to very small numbers of tenants in Scotland—I think it is about 6 per cent. in the private sector as a whole. Those who are at present in short-term tenancies will be a small proportion of that. The Minister may say that this will mushroom, that his proposals will make substantial inroads, and that the private sector in Scotland will suddenly increase substantially, but I do not believe that. The Scottish tradition in housing has never been in the private sector—it has always been in the public sector, and that will not change substantially.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, short-term tenancies can meet the requirements of families on the move, so we must get a focus and fomula that provides the right balance between the rights of the landlord and those of the tenant, which will be fiendishly difficult in statutory
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0520">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>803</span>
terms. Legislation must be on the basis that everybody will act in good faith, people do not act in good faith—landlords do not, and neither do some tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not expert in these matters, but in my experience of housing in the provincial precincts of my constituency, and as a lawyer, the sheriff court is as good a forum as any, using the common law and building on common law and case precedent. Rather than setting up an edifice of statutory regulation, counter-regulation and anti-counter-regulation, the sheriff should be given maximum discretion to deal with bad tenants or landlords. We should ensure that legal aid will be available so that tenants are not financially prejudiced in taking matters to law, and a minimum should be set. Notice of three months is the rock bottom period that any tenant or landlord should expect. In my experience, trying to re-house people from one local authority to another takes at least three months by the time the paperwork and everything else is taken into account. Twelve weeks is not a long time. If landlords know that that will be the period of time after which they can repossess property, subject to recourse to the sheriff if tenants are unreasonable, that would be a reasonable way to proceed. My fundamental objection to clause 29 is that two months is too short.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to press the Minister on the responses he had during the consultation process. The Committee has not drawn as much on those responses as it could have done, because we have been short of time up to now. Now that we are to discuss the Bill on a sensible timetable, we should not forget that the Government spent a lot of time and energy on the consultation process. I accept that it was too short and there are criticisms of that, but a lot of evidence was provided and we should draw on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I may be subject to the criticism that my contribution is "on the one hand" and "on the other hand" but if I vote against the clause it will be with some misgivings. I understand the Minister's problem, but I do not think the Government have the formula right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Member's position.

The hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) spoke about a maximum of six months, but it is a minimum of six months. All leases of residential property in Scotland last for not more than 20 years at the outside.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Existing tenants will have, and will continue to have, security of tenure under the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984, and assured tenants under the new legislation will have similar security. As to harassment, once the Bill is enacted, all tenants will have greater protection than at present. Under the present law, the offence of harassment is subject to a test of intent, which has often been difficult to prove. The Bill provides for an additional offence of harassing an occupier subject to a test of knowing the consequences rather than the intent. That is, it will be an offence to harass an occupier, knowing or being in a position where the person ought to know, that the action is likely to cause the occupier to leave.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Lambie.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman quite deliberately used the expression "Rachmanism", all Members of the Committee know perfectly well that that is a byword for harassment and high handed eviction which occured in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another safeguard is that the Bill provides for a new civil right to compensation for a tenant when illegal eviction occurs. The basis for assessing the amount of damages under the new arrangements will be the difference in value of the house concerned with a sitting tenant and with vacant possession. That alone should remove the incentive for a Rachman-like landlord to evict tenants in order to sell the property, and it is a strong protection against harassment and Rachmanism. The hon. Gentleman was also wrong in the figures on housing assocations that he gave the other night. The parliamentary answer I gave him on 26th October last has the correct figures, showing that they have substantially increased over the years since 1979.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have the figures in front of me. They are in stark contradiction to what the Minister is saying. Clearly, since 1979 they have gone up by the percentage that I set out—that is, from £84 million to £133 million this year. Will he deny that this is less than in 1982? The amount declined in the subsequent years—1983, 1984 and 1985. In 1986, it still stood at less than in 1983.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1984, repriced for inflation, the figures are £16 million up, to £84 million. There was a fivefold increase under Labour, while it has not even doubled under the Conservatives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to make it clear to the Hon. Gentleman that those statistics are totally misleading. In 1977–78, under the Labour Government, the gross allocation for housing associations—the amount which would actually be spent on them—was £27·1 million; in 1978–79 it was £31·4 million; in 1979–80 it was £48·6 million. It then went right up, and has gone up ever since. This year, as the Hon. Gentleman said, the gross allocation is more than £130 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister admit that the three figures that he has given are the same figures that I gave repriced for inflation? The £27 million under Labour, repriced for inflation, is £61 million, the £31 million under Labour in the following year is £63 million and the £48·6 million which the Conservative Government inherited is the £84 million figure. Will the Minister admit that we are talking about the same set of figures?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, and what is absolutely clear is that the figures have gone up enormously since the Labour Government were in power. The year 1982–83 was a bumber year, but the figures have gone up substantially. For 1986–87, the figure was £118·3 million, adjusted for inflation. The increase has been steady and reliable throughout. The impression that the hon. Gentleman was giving was totally misleading.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The figures for gross allocation in 1982–83 were £108 million, in 1983–84 they were more than £109 million, in 1984–85 more than £101 million, in 1985–86 more than £104 million, in 1986–87 more than £113 million, in 1987–88 more £123 million, and this year as the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Repriced for inflation, that means that, from the Minister's own figure, the figure dropped from £135 million in 1982, to £113 million the following year. The following year housing associations, through the Housing Corporation were robbed of another £15 million when it dropped, and the following year they were robbed of another £3 million by the Government. In each of the three years after 1982, the Government robbed housing associations of money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 431, in page 17, leave out lines 36 to 42.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would delete subsection (2). It is a probing amendment to clarify the way in which the Bill will work in regard to a landlord regaining
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>808</span>
possession in a short assured tenancy. As it stands, the subsection provides that a notice must be served by the landlord giving two months' notice of the fact that he requires possession of the house before termination of the tenancy. It says:
	<br><q><p>"A notice under paragraph (c) of subsection (1) above may be served before … the termination of the tenancy".</p></q>
The Minister should clarify those words. Do they mean that, as soon as a short assured tenancy begins, it will be possible for the landlord to serve such a notice, giving two month's notice that he requires possession and that the tenant will thereafter be liable for eviction? If so, that makes nonsense of his claim in the last debate there that will be a minimum of six months' security of tenure under short assured tenancies. What does "before" mean in the subsection?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2) further appears to suspend the rule of common law in respect of tacit relocation. It would allow the tenancy to be the subject of proceedings for possession and consequently the tenant could be evicted following an order for possession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A landlord could offer a contractual short assured tenancy of, say, six months and allow the tenant to remain by tacitly relocating the tenancy, and then terminate the tenancy at any time so long as two months' notice were given and a court order, which would be mandatory, was then granted. It would clearly be attractive for landlords if they were able to grant tenancies at a market rent with security of tenure limited to two months following a notice for repossession. Will the Minister confirm that that is the way in which the Bill can be interpreted?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the landlord charges a new rent, there will be a new contractual tenancy and not a tenancy that is relocated tacitly. In those circumstances, one assumes that the tenant would have the original period of security, which in this example would be six months, but if the wording of the Bill is unchanged, it could be terminated before the six months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is not clear is what would happen where there was a contractual term to increase the rent and the tenancy had then been tacitly relocated. Would the landlord be entitled to receive the increased rent and still be entitled to maintain that he had not created a new contractual tenancy? If the landlord does not ask for any rent increases, it appears that a short assured tenancy could be terminated at any time following the expiry of the initial period of contract so long as two months' notice has been served. I should be grateful if the Minister would answer all the points that have been raised by Shelter. They need to be clarified before the Committee can consider the terms of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the length of short assured tenancy, the first period must be six months. Thereafter, it does not need to be for that length of time, although the notice must be given two months in advance. The intention is that the notice should be served two months before it is due to take effect. The hon. Gentleman also asked what "before" means in the context of the clause. It means before termination of the tenancy, but it could have no effect until the finish or expiry of the lease.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that the wording of the subsection is not clear and could be interpreted otherwise? That may be the Minister's intention, but will he table an amendment to make that clear?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is an extremely technical provision. I will try to explain what it means as a whole, and if the Hon. Gentleman has any further queries, he can ask me. This amendment would have the effect of deleting subsection (2) of clause 30. That in turn would merely have the effect of reviving a doubt that subsection (2) is intended to remove. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will allow me to give a brief explanation of the subsection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Normally, if a lease reaches its contractual expiry date—its ish—without notice to quit having been served by either the landlord or the tenant, the lease will continue by tacit relocation for another year if the original lease was for a year or more, or for whatever the original period was if it was less than a year. If the landlord and tenant continue to do nothing, the renewal will continue indefinitely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In order to stop the operation of tacit relocation, a notice to quit must be served. This has the technical effect of terminating the lease, but if tacit relocation is operating, the termination cannot take effect until the end of the period deemed under tacit relocation to be the term of the lease. That means that under the common law, after the lease has expired and when tacit relocation is operating, the landlord cannot regain possession for what may be up to a further year. The effect of subsection (2) is that this rule of common law may be overridden and the tenant is entitled in any circumstances to the two months' notice to which clause 31(l)(c) entitles him. The purpose is simply to produce a reasonably understandable uniformity, rather than the somewhat bewildering effects of the operation of tacit relocation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The subsection that the amendment would delete is therefore neutral in character. It will often give the tenant a longer notice than he would be entitled to under common law, and it would also avoid injustice to a landlord who might find that through an oversight he or she could not recover possession under a short assured tenancy for as much as a year after it had expired. That would be contrary to the whole intention of short assured tenancies, and so we must have that subsection for both those reasons. With that explanation, I hope that the hon. Gentleman may feel able to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If a lease is for the minimum of six months, as stated in section 29, and given that no notice or any other contractual arrangement is made between the parties, it will continue on the basis of the original tenancy, which will be for another six months. As I read the clause, at any time during that period when the tacit relocation is in operation, the tenant could receive a notice to quit and could leave before the expiry of the six-month period that would normally operate under tacit relocation. Is my understanding correct?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the position. Of course, it is important that he must receive at least two months' notice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not understand the justification for the Government's interference with the common law provisions of tacit relocation in any case. The Minister said in a rather throw-away phrase that this was to rationalise things or make them simpler, or something equally inane. I do not understand why they do not leave tacit relocation well alone. The courts and landlords understand it. It is a perfectly simple doctrine that has served Scots law for many a long year. What is the justification for interfering with it now? Far from clarifying the position, it will introduce extra statutory confusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to follow up that point by the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood). It strikes me as strange that we should interfere with this well-established and well-known rule of Scots law. A landlord who does not take care, or simply decides that he will allow the tenancy to continue on the basis of tacit relocation, thereby lulling the tenant into a false sense of security, can at any stage and for any reason—and the reason need not be stated—serve a notice to remove the tenant. I appreciate that the tenant is given two months, but it is a question of certainty and stability for tenants in such a situation. I do not for the life of me understand why we need to interfere with this well-known rule. If the landlord wants to recover possession and he is aware that he wants to recover possession, he has a six-month period in which to serve his notice—and I can see why that would be allowed—but once it has gone into the period of tacit relocation, why is the landlord then being given the opportunity to usurp what has been a long-established Scottish legal tradition?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) asked what the reason was. Basically, after the lease has expired and the doctrine of tacit relocation is working, the landlord cannot regain possesssion, so the purpose is to give the landlord a definite date, not a date that may be delayed by up to a year. After all, he may find that, through an oversight, he cannot recover possession for as much as a year. Hon. Members may disagree with it but that is the purpose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be grateful if the Minister would confirm that all three conditions (a), (b) and (c) would have to apply before the sheriff could make an order for possession of the house. In other words, the ish must have been reached before he can make an order for possession under the two months.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to be able to reply with one word, yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has confirmed that we are now legislating for landlords' carelessness Not only are we removing tenants' rights wholesale by creating this new form of short assured tenancy but we are

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>811</span>
legislating so that landlords may be careless, and so can at any time remove tenants. It is an outrageous position and one which I find indefensible. Simply for the expediency of cashing in on what the Minister regards as a market but which I think may be mythical, we shall allow landlords to stampede all over tenants who will have no rights. It is an outrageous and appalling position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The more I listen to the debate, the less I like it. I assumed that because of my ignorance of the background to the justification for this change I was missing something and there was some balance and advantage to be found in this measure. I am horrified by what I have heard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, under the guise of rationalisation—I did not quite catch the phrase that the Minister used—we are changing a well-established system of common law that people understand with the clear purpose of giving landlords extra powers, in addition to everything else. I am deeply disturbed about that. I was happy to consider this simply as a sensible probing amendment from the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion), but I am convinced now that we should press it to a Division and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will consider doing so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) for the way in which he moved the amendment. I was interested in the comments of my hon. Friend the Member Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) and the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) in the light of their legal experience. As the hon. Gentleman has just said, the amendment was originally moved as a probing amendment on the assumption that we would have some respectable clarification, but the Minister has confirmed our worst fears.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision simply gives a careless landlord a second chance to take possession. That is in marked contrast to a number of other aspects of the Bill, which do not give tenants a second chance if they fail to take advantage of any of its detailed provisions. If they make a mistake, they are out on their ear along with their family, whereaas in this case the Minister is breaching an established principle and helping careless and sloppy landlords to exploit their tenants even further. I see no justification for it and I shall encourage my hon. Friend to press the amendment to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must understand that we must look at both sides of the equation. Under common law the tenant would have less notice than he would under the provisions of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Notice under the clause must be at least two months. That is clearly important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>812</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That could be construed as a misleading statement, although I do not say that it is deliberate. Tacit relocation means that the provisions of the agreement are continued. There may be a six month or a three month clause for notice in the existing agreement which is being tacitly relocated. Therefore, one cannot say willy-nilly that the tenant has some great new rights; he has the same rights under tacit relocation as he had under his existing statutory contractural agreement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under this provision tenants would be entitled to longer notice than they would in many cases under common law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman suggests that we are legislating for carelessness. We have already done that in clause 17 for a tenant's carelessness, where a tenant has not read his lease properly. One must consider all the facts and circumstances, and we believe that the subsection is justified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend the Minister clarify something for me? As I understand it, tacit relocation applies to leases of up to one year which do not have to be proved by probative document. If the lease which is granted in whatever form for a period of whatever length up to one year is not terminated by the actings of the landlord and is perpetuated by the actings of the tenant—in other words, they remain silent on the matter—the lease is replaced, that is to say renewed, for the same time. It is presumed to be a second grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is so, clause 30 does alter the position, because it assumes that tacit relocation is a day-today renewal of the lease and a tenant can be given notice at any time within two months. If he occupied the premises, let us say, until 31 December, remained without notice to quit in the premises until 31 January and then received his two months' notice, he would be able to stay, on the relocated part, for only three months. If the original lease was for nine months, his relocation would be six months short. I think that I am right, but perhaps the Minister will clear that up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The position is not exactly as my hon. and learned Friend has described it. Tacit relocation does not have to operate for leases lasting a year. It can operate for any length of time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said, the amendment was a probing amendment but, having probed, we have discovered that the Minister is up to his dirty work again. He has not answered the points raised by the legal experts on both sides of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister suggested that he was looking at both sides of the equation, but he is not doing that: he is looking at the side which suits landlords and will operate distinctly to the disadvantage of tenants. It appears to me, and I imagine to all Opposition Members, that the Minister is introducing a set of circumstances which will mean that tenants can be more easily evicted from their premises than they can at present under tacit relocation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The essential point is that the Minister is taking away the rights of Scottish tenants under tacit
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0525">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>813</span>
relocation—rights which are long established in common law—and substituting the two months' notice condition, which seriously weakens their rights. As he has not answered that basic point, I shall persist in the amendment and ask the Committee to divide on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I say may not change the hon. Gentleman's mind, but it is important to put it clearly on the record. I said that we would ensure that notice would be two months and that that could be shorter under tacit relocation, as it could be if the period of the lease was shorter than two months. The hon. Gentleman may say that that will not happen often, but that is the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may state the position as I understand it. On tenancies of less than a year, if a tenant took a short assured tenancy for a month only, the tacit relocation would renew the tenancy for a month only. Therefore, under clause 30, the notice would renew the tenancy for longer—for two months. Not many people take tenancies for a month and, in any event, they would not be short assured tenancies. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I am obliged—a short sharp tenancy. Such a tenancy is usually six months. Clause 29 requires that it be for a term of not less than six months. In any lease that is longer than two months, clause 30 reduces the common-law right of tacit relocation. I do not know of any recommendation by the Law Commission that the common law rights of Scotland, which have stood the test of time for so long, should be thus abrogated or altered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can see no right of principle why, if a landlord has acquiesced in a renewal of the tenancy on the same grounds, that right and that agreement by acquiescence should be stopped at the whim of a two months' notice. It is as simple as that. We are talking of a maximum of only 12 months' tenancy for the simple reason that a probity lease, which is longer than 12 months, is only renewed by tacit relocation for 12 months. If one has a five-year lease and there is an acquiescent renewal, it cannot be for more than a year. No reason seems to have been advanced for not retaining the ordinary right of tacit relocation. If one enters into an agreement and agrees to continue it by consent, inaction or acquiescence, one is renewing the same agreement, not a terminal agreement which one did not take the trouble either to renew or to terminate. That is an important principle. I ask the Minister to reconsider this to see whether that is not a more equitable concept.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to my hon. and learned Friend. As I said yesterday, we shall proceed in the Committee with maximum reasonableness. This is a highly technical provision. I will certainly consider the points that he and other hon. Members have made. It is not a simple matter. There are many technical points in the Bill [	<i>Interruption.</i>]—if the hon. member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) wishes to say something, he is perfectly entitled to interrupt me. I remember putting
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>814</span>
forward an amendment to a housing Bill which Mr. Hugh Brown promptly accepted. However, when the then hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart, now my learned Friend the Member for Southend, East (Mr. Taylor) said something to which Mr. Brown took great offence that acceptance of my amendment was withdrawn. If the hon. Gentleman persists, I may follow that worthy precedent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is difficult to understand what the Minister is saying.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I advise my hon. Friend and anyone else who is interested in the proceedings of the Committee to compare the Minister's original speech, when he advised the Committee to reject the amendment out of hand, with -the speech that he made after he had been nobbled by the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn). I do not want to upset him, but it gives the impression that things are getting a bit out of control.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirk wood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may add a tailpiece. I hope that the Minister will consider this seriously. The case was made out perfectly by the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn). It is not a technical provision, but an important principle of Scottish law. I know that he has an affection for the great body and corpus of law. I hope that he will bear that in mind when he undertakes his reconsideration of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the basis that the Minister has agreed to take this away, reconsider it and come back to the Committee with an amendment, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a probing amendment. It would leave out subsection (3). It seeks to ask the Minister to confirm the circumstances in which a statutory assured tenancy can grow out of the short assured tenancy. Subsection (3) reads:
	<br><q><p>"Where the sheriff makes an order for possession of a house by virtue of subsection (1) above, any statutory assured tenancy which has arisen as at that ish shall end …".</p></q>
I simply want to know in what circumstances a statutory assured tenancy can arise. It does not seem to be provided for elsewhere in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can explain both the provision and the effect of the amendment If the amendment were accepted, a

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>815</span>
landlord would be obliged to issue a second notice to quit before being able to regain possession under a short assured tenancy. Perhaps I should explain what we expect to happen under short assured tenancies. At the expiry of a short assured tenancy—its ish—a landlord will usually either want to regain possession of his house at once or he will offer the tenant a new short assured tenancy. After all, the whole purpose of short assured tenancies is to allow people who are prepared to let their houses for a limited period to have a guarantee of repossession when they need the house again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In order for a statutory assured tenancy to come into effect, the original tenancy must be terminated by issuing a notice to quit. The only circumstances in which that happens without the landlord regaining possession is likely to be if the landlord's proceedings for possession are not completed by the ish—or expiry—of the tenancy. All subsection (3) does is to make sure that in those circumstances the landlord does not have to issue another notice to quit. I can assure the hon. Committee that, whatever the circumstances, the tenant will be entitled to two months' notice of proceedings for possession under subsection (1) of clause 30.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am mystified. Clause 30 provides that a notice is necessary only when the landlord requires possession. The Minister seems to be saying that, as the Bill is drafted, it is impossible for two parties—a willing landlord and a willing tenant—to enter into a new contract that would allow the tenancy to be translated from a short assured tenancy to a statutory assured tenancy. I cannot see how that operates. If it operates under the legislation, it is unnecessarily complex. The draftsman really needs to reconsider it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another point, unrelated to the drafting, is that it is a pipe dream to suggest that landlords, with all the powers that they have under the short assured tenancy, will willingly agree to translate it. We have had long discussions on the full effect of the short assured tenancy. I do not understand how the provision is expected to operate or why it is necessary. Are parties free to enter into a contract without the necessity of notices of quit flying about all over the place? If that is what the Bill will achieve, it is nonsense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamliton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A short assured tenancy would come into operation at the termination of a contractual tenancy. The notes on clauses state about subsection (3):

Do not worry, Mr. Lambie. I do not intend to go through the whole story about the spectre of evictions haunting the land of Scotland in the future again, although that is precisely what the Bill is about. It will generate an atmosphere of insecurity among tenants in Scotland. We have been through the story about assured tenancies and the grounds for eviction under schedule 5. Here we are again in relation to short assured tenancies. The clause establishes the procedure whereby a landlord can evict his tenants. The only difference between this and the ordinary variety of assured tenancy is that it will happen even sooner and the landlord will have the right to activate eviction proceedings even earlier if he decides to take advantage of the short assured tenancy machinery.

The Minister made great play of the fact that I described it as a "landlords' dream". He seemed to think that that was a good thing because landlords should be encouraged to dream and to take advantage of such machinery. The Opposition are profoundly worried about what the Government are up to. We fear that that type of recovery action is likely to be a fairly common occurrence in rented

housing in Scotland in the coming months and years. For that reason we do not like the principle of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make two points about clause 30. First, I repeat my worry that the direction in which the Bill is generally going seems to be erecting statutory edifices that will serve to confuse rather than to clarify the picture. If I was in any doubt about that, the exchange between the Minister and the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) on the last amendment certainly clarified my mind. It is disgraceful. If the Minister has any free time today, he should take the parliamentary draftsman out to a quiet lunch and wrap the Bill round his neck. He should tell him that it will be served up on a plate unless he comes back with pieces of legislation that make more sense than subsection (3).

My second point applies to the rest of the Bill. It is bad law to put clauses in Bills that make sheriffs the puppets of statutes. The clause mandates the sheriff in certain circumstances to take certain actions. The Government might as well hire puppets as pay fancy salaries to sheriffs to interpret and apply the law of the land. I think that is bad law generally, but I fear that that is the way that stautory provision is increasingly going, and certainly it is so with the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 30 is a duff clause with a capital "D". Quite apart from its effects on the implementation of the recovery of possession on termination of a short assured tenancy, mandatory laws on sheriffs are bad and draftsmanship like this should be given the bum's rush.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, may I state exactly what the clause will do. I shall obviously look seriously at the point that was raised in relation to the earlier amendment. The clause provides that security of tenure under a short assured tenancy will be limited to the period of the lease. A landlord would be able to repossess his property at the end of a short assured tenancy, but he might equally well decide to let the tenancy run on or offer the tenant a new contractual tenancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To clarify the point that we discussed on the last amendment, at the end of a short assured tenancy, as with any other tenancy, it is entirely open to a landlord and tenant to negotiate a new contractual assured tenancy. As statutory assured tenancy can only arise when an assured tenancy, whether short or not, is terminated by notice to quit, but the landlord either chooses not to seek possession or does not have adequate grounds for so doing. I hope that that answers the point raised by the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>REFERENCE OF EXCESSIVE RENTS TO RENT ASSESSMENT COMMITTEE</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 432, in page 18, line 5, leave out from "below" to "may" in line 8 and insert
	<br><q><p>"the tenant under a short assured tenancy".</p></q>
Clause 31 deals with the reference of excessive rents to rent assessment committees. There will be some interesting developments in the role of rent assessment committees in Scotland, which I suspect will be second only to the development in the role of sheriff officers and removal men when the legislation goes on the statute book.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I took the liberty of having a brief discussion with the clerk of the rent assessment committee that deals with the Lothian and borders region and I discovered that she is the one and only full-time employee in the whole of that region. Goodness knows whether she will be able to cope with the increased work load that will arise from the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would remove the reference in subsection (1), which enables a tenant to refer his rent to the rent assessment committee only if he believes that the rent set by his landlord
	<br><q><p>"is significantly higher than the rents payable under similar tenancies of similar houses in the locality."</p></q>
We believe that all tenants in short assured tenancies should have the right of access to the rent assessment committee. We are worried that landlords, particularly in the early stages of this type of tenure, may try to jack up rents to unreasonable levels. It is important that tenants should have a clear right of access to a committee which will be able to review their rent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would also prevent the onus being put on the tenant to prove that he considers his rent to be significantly higher than others payable under similar tenancies before satisfying the rent assessment committee that it has jurisdiction to consider his appeal. As the Bill stands, a tenant under a short assured tenancy has a right to make application to a rent assessment committee for a determination of his rent only if he considers that the rent payable
	<br><q><p>"is significantly higher than the rents payable under similar tenancies of similar houses in the locality."</p></q>
That wording in the Bill is too restrictive and is likely to give rise to difficulties. For instance, what does the word "significantly" mean? Will it be up to the tenant to prove that he has grounds for considering that his rent is significantly higher than rents payable under similar tenancies before the rent assessment committee will consider his referral? What about cases where a tenant's rent is considered to be higher than other rents payable under similar tenancies but is not considered to be "significantly" higher?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tenant will first have to find out what other rents are in his neighbourhood and will then have to prove that he thinks that his rent is "significantly" higher, whatever that means, than those of his neighbours, before the rent assessment committee can even start thinking about it. Even then that is not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0528">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>819</span>
the end of his troubles. How is a tenant supposed to go about finding out what rents are for similar properties in his neighbourhood? How can an individual tenant do that? Is he to go round knocking on doors saying, "Excuse me, what rent are you paying to your landlord? Is your house the same as mine? Can I come in with a measuring tape and measure it up and see what the accommodation is like?" I suspect that a number of neighbours might tell a tenant trying to obtain that kind of information where he could go and to mind his own business, but all he will be trying to do is to mind his own business and protect himself from having to pay an excessive rent. Surely it is the job of the rent assessment committee to work out the comparators and what the fair rents should be, and every tenant should have a right of access to the committee so that it can establish what the rent should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The wording of the subsection that the rent must be
	<br><q><p>"significantly higher than the rents payable under similar tenancies of similar houses in the locality"</p></q>
could cause great problems, especially in the short term, where there are unlikely to be enough similar tenancies of similar houses in a locality against which the tenant can compare his own rent. That is of particular importance given the likelihood of the tenant having to prove that he considers his rent to be significantly high in comparison. Far too many hurdles will be placed in the way of tenants who try to have their rent brought down to a fairer level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In current market conditions, and given that in the short term there will not be a pool of similar tenancies in the locality, the clause as worded would leave the door wide open for litigation by landlords regarding the rent assessment committee's jurisdiction to consider an application for a determination of rent—in other words, whether the rent assessment committee can even start to intervene in the case. My hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) said a minute or two ago that he was grateful to the Government for creating fruitful employment for solicitors and lawyers in Scotland in future. This is yet another example. A landlord could try to prevent the case even being considered by the rent assessment committee on the ground that it did not fulfil the criteria in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suppose that it could be argued that, given that there are no similar tenancies of similar houses in a locality, or very few, the tenant could not consider his rent to be significantly higher and thus had no right to make an application to the rent assessment committee, so he would be cut off on those grounds. If that argument held, the rent assessment committee would have no jurisdiction to consider the application at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that all short assured tenants should have the right to make application to the rent assessment committee for a determination of rent which, in the committee's opinion, the landlord might reasonably be expected to obtain. As the clause is worded, the tenant's right to make application is neither direct nor clear. It would be far too easy, particularly in the crucial initial stages of this type of tenancy, for landlords to prevent such cases being considered by the rent assessment committee at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>820</span>
I shall be interested to hear what the Minister says about the role and the resources of rent assessment committees, because I suspect that the one official who is currently serving the rent assessment committees in the Lothian and Borders regions will be run off her feet in the near future, although perhaps the Government intend landlords to use this catch-22 which is being incorporated in the Bill to debar appeals to rent assessment committees before they are started. In that case, it is not a realistic protection against excessive rents, and the Committee should demand clearer assurances that tenants will be able to have access to the rent assessment committees, as they should.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with interest and sympathy to what the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) has said about the amendment, as it highlights the fact that in the clause the Government may be getting the worst of all possible worlds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the one hand, it is the Government's aim to provide incentives to potential landlords to bring property into the market. The clause will clearly act as a disincentive, because it will reduce the return in certain circumstances and will create a great deal of uncertainty about its operation, for some of the reasons put forward by the hon. Gentleman. On the other hand, the object of the clause is presumably to provide realistic safeguards for tenants. But, as the hon. Member for East Lothian has pointed out, in practice it is difficult to see how it will operate. Is it reasonable to expect a typical tenant to have to go to the lengths of justifying his application to the rent assessment committee by providing all the evidence to which the hon. Gentleman referred?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's speech also highlights the question whether the subsection is workable. I want to refer to the points put to the Committee by the Law Society of Scotland about the wording of the subsection. As my hon. Friend the Minister will be aware, it believes that the subsection is circuitous and thus would be difficult for the rent assessment committee to apply properly—it contains criteria to assist the committee, so the committee will have no yardstick against which to gauge its assessment of a reasonable rent. It completes its comments on this point by saying:
	<br><q><p>"We are aware that valuation has been described on many occasions as an art rather than an exact science. However in terms of this clause as drafted, it becomes a matter of guesswork."</p></q>
That perhaps generalises what the hon. Gentleman said in moving the amendment—is the clause worth having at all, given, on the one hand, the difficulties that tenants will face in obtaining the evidence to justify an application to a rent assessment committee and, on the other hand, the uncertainty that it will create among landlords, thus reducing the incentive to bring extra accommodation to the market?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
