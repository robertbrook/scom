	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 133, in page 6, line 37, leave out subsection (2) and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(2) The headteacher shall from time to time consult the School Board on how the funds provided under this section are to be spent and shall consider any advice given to him in this regard by the Board.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 61, in page 6, leave out lines 38 to 42 and insert—
	<div class='ul'>
	<li>"(a) shall from time to time advise the School Board as to how he has spent and proposes to spend the funds provided by this section;</li>
	<li>(b) shall take into consideration the views of the Board in deciding upon such spending.".</li></div> <!-- ul --></p>
	<p>No. 159, in page 7, line 8, at end insert—
	<div class='ul'>
	<li>"(5) In the event of the head teacher and the School Board being unable to reach agreement upon the allocation of funds, the matter shall be referred to the education authority for determination.".</li></div> <!-- ul --></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the first time we reach the meat of the subject since we are talking about an aspect of the school board's work—the clause deals with books, materials and so on. We need to debate this matter because if we do not get it right it could lead to an unsettling initial period for school boards and could throw into sharp doubt the validity of the relationship between head teachers, the education authority and the school board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue before us is the power of the school board and the role of the head teacher. The clause suggests that, from time to time, the head teacher will be required to put proposals to the board for expenditure on books, materials and equipment. The crucial point is contained in subsection 2(b) which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The headteacher shall not spend funds on any proposal unless it is approved by the Board."</p></blockquote>
Amendment No. 133 seeks to change that subsection by outlining a more realistic set of circumstances. We believe that the head teacher should consult with the board and should consider any advice given about expenditure. That would reflect more adequately how an education authority works at present. It determines expenditure for a school and that allows the head teacher, in conjunction with his senior staff, to work out how that can be spent appropriately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>412</span>
The danger in subsection (2) is that the head teacher will be caught in a curious position. He is responsible to the education authority from which he will receive his funds. However he must now submit detailed proposals to the school board, which will have a complete veto on his expenditure, unless the board members concur with his proposals. In a sense, and the Minister will probably confirm this, that veto is the school board's first real power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to detail some of the dangers in the clause and to point out some of the omissions that are a grave cause for concern unless tackled by the Minister. Amendment No. 133 changes subsection (2) to a consultative relationship. Amendment No. 159 seeks to tackle a glaring omission in the Bill. There seems to be no mechanism to deal with a failure on the part of the head teacher and the board to agree about expenditure proposals. That problem should be resolved in the interests of the school and the pupils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The school board should obviously work on the basis of good will and co-operation between the members of the board and the head teacher, but we are dealing with the harsh reality of a school's financial expenditure. Traditionally, head teachers have exercised an important professional and management function in relation to the quality and quantity of schools' equipment, books and materials.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a head teacher submits proposals to the board, the board may legitimately express disquiet. What will happen if, after discussion about expenditure proposals, the school board does not accept the head teacher's method of spending or his priorities? I hope that most difficulties can be resolved by discussion, but what happens if an impasse is reached when the head teacher and the board cannot agree? Where are the means of conciliation? Is the Minister suggesting that the local education authority should arbitrate or that another forum should be devised, through regulation, to accommodate any difficulties? Is he merely hoping that there will be no fundamental differences?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue of the time scale is important. Books, materials and equipment are an important part of the curriculum. If there is a long exchange of views and no agreement is reached, how long will it be before expenditure plans are disrupted, materials and books are unavailable and there is an educational muddle? They are the key issues with which I hope that the Minister will deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to dwell on the link between the expenditure on books, materials and equipment and the curriculum that has been devised by the education authority and which, as stated in clause 15, has not been delegated to the school board. How will the Minister ensure that any resolution of conflict can be adequately accommodated within legislation or regulations? It will clearly be a major obstacle to management functions if the curriculum is not delegated to the school board but the power of veto over expenditure to implement the curricular proposals is. There is nothing in the Bill to allay my fears about that. It may well be that the proposals agreed by a board on an expenditure pattern for materials and equipment are wildly at odds with the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0979">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>413</span>
curriculum set down by the education authority, it may involve a departure from the curriculum or it may invalidate it because the priorities defined by the education authority are not fully matched by the decisions taken by the school board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another reason for tabling the amendment is the potential undermining of the head teacher's authority. When we discuss clause 9 we can examine what will happen in the future. Until now the head teacher has ultimately been responsible to the education authority, but he will now face severe difficulties when working for two masters. He will be responsible for curricula to the education authority, but responsible to the board for expenditure on materials, books and equipment to satisfy the requirements of the education authority. His role must be enhanced by a clarification of the two issues that we discussed previously—disagreements and the consultative role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another matter arising from the head teacher's involvement is the system of line management and responsibility. We are not trying to make political points about the head teacher's role, but it is reasonable to suggest that there is a problem. The Minister nods approvingly so I have obviously caught his imagination with the moderate tones with which I have put forward my views. I shall continue in that vein.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If managment responsibilities in the schools are to be taken seriously it would be reasonable for the Minister to accept that a consultative link between the head teacher and the board may be more productive and meaningful—at least in the first two or three years. Such a link would overcome the problems about the definition of roles and allow the boards to establish some crucial credibility for their decision-making processes. We are anxious about such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting that the problem of who ultimately decides on books and materials emerged during discussions on the Education (No. 2) Act 1986, which covers England and Wales. Under that Act, the education authority can delegate responsibility to governing bodies to look after expenditure on books, equipment, stationery and materials. An interesting section of that Act allows a school's governing board to delegate full responsibility to the head teacher and to empower him to take all the decisions on books, equipment and stationery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think for a minute that the Minister will accept the amendment, even if he is generous. However, that English legislation assumes that there may be significant problems concerning discussion and agreement on expenditure. It provides a built-in opportunity for the board to acknowledge that and to delegate a specific responsibility to the head teacher, to oversee discussions on books, stationery and materials.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister is not convinced I draw his attention to that aspect of the Education (No. 2) Act that at least accommodated some of the fears and anxieties expressed when it proceeded through the House. It captures some of the main arguments that I have tried to outline this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>414</span>
An unstable situation could emerge. We want the professional integrity of the head teacher to be accepted. As a councillor, I have had run-ins with head teachers. Sometimes they assume absolute powers in certain areas and that causes anxiety to parents and others. A head teacher's professional integrity and serious management responsibilities must be acknowledged. Establishing a consultative link between head teachers and boards would satisfy the basic requirements of the expenditure programme. It would allow for the great potential for conflict that will exist under the new system between the education authorities and the school boards. It will enable the establishment of a system of school boards whereby the ultimate powers are not absorbed and accommodated too quickly. The boards can learn to crawl before they walk. The danger is that we shall create a system with built-in weaknesses and conflicts. We could alleviate that further consideration now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With those comments I support the amendments, in particular, amendment No. 133.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumfries)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall make a short intervention to ask the Minister for some clarification. First, I declare an interest as a supplier of school and library books to education authorities throughout the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 9(1) requires every education authority to provide finance for the purchase of books and materials. Clause 9(2) then prevents head teachers from spending the money without approval of the board. Surely that is the wrong way round. Would it not be better if the board decided in consultation with the head teacher what the school required, and then asked the education authority for the necessary finance? Otherwise, subsections (1) and (2) conflict, because the education authority can say to the head teacher, "Here's the money—buy the books" but subsection (2) says that the head teacher cannot spend a penny until he has had a chat with the board. The Minister may have good reasons for making such a provision, but at face value it is a complicated system for supplying the necessary books and equipment to schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can help my hon. Friend. It has not yet been mentioned in our discussions that for the first time education authorities will be obliged to provide the funds that they consider necessary for books and equipment. Hitherto, there was no statutory requirement for them to provide a capitation allowance. That is the reason for the provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's comments are helpful, but if the school board is to do its duty it should consult the head teacher and tell the education authority that X number of books and certain equipment are required. The education authority should then provide the finance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the capitation fee that my hon. Friend mentioned, but although the head teacher will be told
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0980">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>415</span>
the amount of the capitation fee he will be unable to do anything about it until he has consulted the school board. That seems a roundabout system to obtain the best result.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gordon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak briefly, as amendment No. 61 which I tabled is in this group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I disagree slighly with the last point made by the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro), although I understand his concern. I do not object to the head teacher being required to consult the board before making a decision, but I object to the fact that the board, rather than the head teacher, will make the decision. There is no mechanism for resolving disputes and determining whose interests will prevail once the matter is resolved. The teaching profession is legitimately worried, not that its professional judgment can be questioned, which would not be unreasonable, but that it can be challenged. That may ultimately undermine confidence in the teachers' authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are all familiar with the argument of parents who say, "This method or that form of equipment was good enough when I was at school, so why should teachers force avant-garde stuff on my children now?" The Minister smiles, but he knows that the newspapers are frequently full of stories in which parents are at odds with teachers. Their reasons may be legitimate—I do not deny that there may be a basis for dispute and I agree that consultation is valid—but parents may become a conservative force in education terms, which will not necessarily be in the interests of pupils or of the teaching profession. It is also slightly at odds with the general thrust of the Government's approach to education, which exalts the role of the head teacher. I have frequently heard Ministers and Tory Members say that the mark of a good school is determined by the quality, motivation and commitment of the head teacher. If we are talking about mood, morale, discipline and academic motivation, it seems strange to deny a head teacher the ultimate right to make the professional, academic decision about what materials and books should be used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the establishment of school boards—I have said previously that school councils should have had that role in the past—I support the parents' right of input, consultation and having their views taken into account. But it is going too far to allow boards to impose their will, or prevent head teachers from using the required materials. That is not a partnership and it gives rise to the problem, which amendment No. 159 seeks to resolve, of how a possible dispute may be settled in a way which satisifies not only honour, but common sense and reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The basic thrust behind the amendments is clear. I shall not go to the battlements on my amendment, but I am anxious to know how the Minister believes that such problems may be resolved. I agree that consultation with parents should be real and that their views should be taken into account, but I do not believe that their views should predominate. If they did, the morale and authority of the head teacher might be undermined to the detriment of the school and of the children attending it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>416</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will resist the amendments. I welcome clause 9, which will be of considerable value in our education system. My only complaint is that the clause is not tough enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (1) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Every education authority shall, in every financial year, make available to the headteacher of every school in their area such funds as they think necessary."</p></blockquote>
We should replace "as they think necessary" with "as are necessary". Country schools have complained to me in recent years that they have had insufficient funds to buy books that were essential for the school to be effective. Subsection (4) deals with relationships and the problem of the curriculum. It says:
	<div class='ul'>
	<li>"(a) any guidance issued in relation to those functions by the education authority; and</li>
	<li>(b) any policy of the education authority in relation to the curriculum of schools."</li></div> <!-- ul -->
Clause 9 covers the relationship between the school board, the head teacher and the education authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unless we make the legislation tougher, I am worried that the question will remain of the education authority acting "as they think fit", or "as they think necessary". One of the actions that Tayside region did not think necessary was to provide sufficient books for country schools. That was due to problems facing the education authority as a result of over provision of facilities in Dundee. The cost of funding that over provision drained resources from country schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister should be wary of the amendments. I welcome the clause, but it is not tough enough and I may consider tabling amendments on Report to make it tougher.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is always a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) because his speeches, being irrelevant, give me an opportunity to bring the debate back to the amendment. The hon. Gentleman referred to expenditure in Dundee being at the expense of the rural schools. The Conservative group in Tayside region opposed expenditure at Kirriemuir high school which is not, by any stretch of the imagination, in Dundee, but no doubt the hon. Gentleman does not want to draw attention to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purchase of books and teaching materials is linked directly to curriculum decisions. As I understand it, the Bill provides that curriculum decisions will ie with the education authority and that the regulation of the curriculum cannot be one of the functions delegated to the school board. The education authority will decide what kind of curriculum will be pursued in the schools within its area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Minister will consider the position of Tayside region in particular. There is a minority Labour administration, the strength of which stems almost exclusively from Dundee district where Labour holds 17 out of 20 seats. The Labour administration gets its policies through with the support of the Scottish National party, whose strength is based in Angus district council. The opposition is the Tory group, whose strength is based in Perth and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0981">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>417</span>
Kinross district council. Politically, the region is divided into three distinct blocks—Labour in Dundee, the SNP in Angus and the Conservatives in Perth and Kinross.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour administration, backed by the SNP, might decide that every school in Tayside should include peace studies as an important part of the curriculum, but when it comes to implementing that decision throughout there could be problems in Perth and Kinross district and at Blairgowrie high school and Perth academy, where school boards dominated by parents who support the Conservative party might bitterly oppose any suggestion that peace studies should be introduced into their schools. Head teachers would receive instructions from their employers to purchase books, equipment and teaching material to implement the curricular decision to go ahead with peace studies, but when they take their spending proposals to the school boards the parent majority could say, "We are not having peace studies in our schools". The Minister must tell us how that impasse would be resolved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the elected majority—albeit a coalition majority—makes a decision to introduce a particular subject such as peace studies, trade union studies or a multi-cultural approach to education, and the decision is resisted by the parent majority on a school board, who decides who has the authority to implement the expenditure involved? Can the school board resist legitimately? In that case, control over the curriculum will rest ultimately with the school board and the parent majority, not with the education authority which has been elected on a clear mandate from the electorate in the area. Will the Minister explain who would have the right to decide about the purchase of books and materials to introduce subjects such as peace studies, or trade union studies into the curriculum if the parent majority on the board opposed that policy? Unless he can tell us that, the Committee should support the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting debate. The representations of the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) about the professional integrity of the head teachers and how important it is that they can spend the capitation allowance without having to seek the approval of the school boards would be more credible if the hon. Gentleman's party, which is in power in Lothian, had not imposed an arbitrary 12.5 per cent, cut in the capitation allowance for their head teachers at a time when the education budget had gone up by 9 per cent. Where was the respect for the professional integrity of the head teachers then, when the pencils were snatched out of the hands of the children? The hon. Gentleman is in no position to lecture us about capitation allowances and head teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause provides for the first time a duty on education authorities to make money available to head teachers for expenditure on books and materials. The authorities will have to provide the amount that they consider necessary for that purpose and be prepared to justify their decision. The days when education authorities could take away money for books and equipment and blame central
	<span class='label label-info column'>418</span>
Government or someone else for it are, I hope, at an end.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that education authorities will have an obligation to make sufficient money available? Does he accept that that also obliges central Government to make sufficient funding available to education authorities, through rate support grant, to enable them to make the necessary funds available to school boards?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the Minister will briefly answer that question and return to the subject of the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, Mr. Knox.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Provision for education in the rate support grant has gone up by more than twice the rate of inflation—some 9 per cent.—at a time of declining rolls. The problem is that some education authorities do not treat books and equipment as a priority. The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) said that peace studies had been introduced in Tayside. If the curriculum can be expanded in into such areas, resources in Tayside cannot be scarce. I am not aware that most parents consider peace studies a priority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) suggested that I should resist the amendments and said that the capitation provisions were not strong enough. If I understand him correctly, he implied that, where the clause says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Every education authority shall … make available … such funds as they think necessary",</p></blockquote>
it should read "such funds necessary". He has given notice that he will table an amendment on that point on Report, and I shall consider the arguments then. We could have been more robust in the requirements for capitation, but I hope that the provision will prompt education authorities to make sensible decisions. The Opposition have been at pains to tell us how responsible education authorities are. If local authorities do not behave sensibly, I shall certainly consider tougher provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro) said that we had things back to front. He said that the board and the head teacher should discuss the level of capitation before the education authority puts its proposals to the school board. There is nothing in the Bill to prevent such a discussion taking place—indeed, the Bill encourages it. I hope that the boards will discuss capitation allowance and the provisions for books and equipment before the education authority determines what it considers necessary. I hope also that boards will make representations to local authorities—as they are entitled to do—about what they consider to be the necessary amount. There is nothing to prevent the discussion that my hon. Friend said should take place. We wish to encourage such discussion. All that is new is that, for the first time, the education authorities will be required to provide the money, whereas, until now, capitation allowance has simply been at the discretion of the education authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) argued that we were questioning the professional integrity
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0982">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>419</span>
of head teachers. He reminded the Committee that head teachers are the key element in schools—a point on which the Committee is in agreement—and said that the Government were trying to diminish their authority. On the contrary, for the first time, the provisions provide the head teacher with resources for books and equipment for his school. True, the head teacher will have to justify his proposals for expenditure on books and equipment to the school board, but there is nothing to threaten professionalism in that. I should have thought that any professional whould have relished the prospect of persuading the school board to endorse his proposals for books and equipment. That is not a threat to professionalism. On the contrary, it is a mark of our confidence in head teachers and their ability to persuade boards of the sense of their proposals, in the vast majority of cases, that we do not see any problems in allowing school boards to approve proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the main thrust of the Minister's argument, but what happens when the board says no? I am wholly in favour of the head teacher putting proposals to the board. The board has a right to have a view about them, and the head teacher should be required to take account of that view. But what happens when the board says no?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Boards will be required to put their arguments to head teachers. If head teachers think that the arguments are sensible, they will accept them and amend their proposals. There would then be agreement. If head teachers think that the boards' view on capitation expenditure are unreasonable, they will not be required to proceed. Opposition amendments allow for a tie breaker in such circumstances. The theme running through the Opposition's amendments seems to be—when in doubt, delegate upwards to the education authority. Such a tie breaker is unnecessary, because education authorities have a duty to ensure adequate and efficient provision of education, and the boards must ensure that they behave in a way that is compatible with the discharge of their authorities' statutory and other legal duties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No doubt, local authorities will intervene if their statutory duties are threatened. The Bill also provides for the Secretary of State to take default action against boards, as he can against education authorities, under section 70 of the 1980 Act. Therefore, there is a means of breaking the deadlock, but I should be surprised if it ever came to that. If it did, it would be on a matter of the most serious principle that concerned parents. The Bill provides for them to call the board to account and to call meetings when 25 per cent, or 30 parents—whichever is the smaller number—wish to do so. Therefore, ample protection is provided in the Bill. Head teachers' proposals must be endorsed, and, measures exist to break any deadlock.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Several people have asked how a conflict will be resolved. Does that constitutional discourse about the Secretary of State's and local education authorities' powers to invervene mean that
	<span class='label label-info column'>420</span>
local authorities will resolve the problem? Will the Minister tell us simply and graphically how a simple breakdown in discussions between head teachers and school boards can be resolved quickly and efficiently?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer to that question is by agreement. One would expect that, in discussions between boards and head teachers, the head teachers' decisions would be endorsed in the vast majority of cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) characteristically asked me to consider a proposal to buy books and equipment for peace studies. Disagreement may occur over such a proposal. If a deadlock is reached, the education authority could argue that the school board was breaching its statutory requirements to ensure adequate and efficient provision of education, because it refused to endorse the head teacher's proposals. As an added protection, the head teacher is under no obligation to incur piecemeal expenditure. He does not have to go ahead with the proposals with which the board disagrees; he can rest on the basis that his proposals have not been accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As in any organisation that must take difficult decisions, a compromise agreement would be reached. Opposition Members argue that the decision should be taken by the education authority, whereas the Government believe that the matter should be determined at board level. If a deadlock threatens children's education, the Bill includes provisions to deal with that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McFall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us take the concrete example of a curriculum that includes the study of the novel "Kes". A few years ago in Northern Ireland, parents organised themselves on school boards. They looked at the curriculum, and some parents objected to that novel and did not want the school to purchase it. A board in Scotland may decide that it does not want that novel in the S1-S2 curriculum. The head teacher may say, "I have discussed that novel with my English department. We have a coherent reading scheme from primary school through to secondary school, and we want 'Kes' to be part of our S1-S2 curriculum, because it follows on." If the board says to the head teacher that he cannot have "Kes" as part of the reading scheme, in the light of what you said Minister—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I did not say anything, and I am not the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. Knox. Would the head teacher have a right to override the board's wishes? If there were a conflict, would it be up to the local education authority to act like Solomon and say yea or nay, the school may or may not have the book? If the Minister would deal with that concrete problem, it will take the argument further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can help the hon. Gentleman. In Denmark, school boards veto books, decide school hours, and so on. If we had wanted such a system we would have proposed it, but we decided that it was not appropriate. The head teacher will put forward
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0983">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>421</span>
his proposals for capitation expenditure. He may want to spend more on books and less on computers, or more on computers and less on pencils, and so on. The school board will approve that. If there is disagreement—the hon. Gentleman may have chosen an extreme example—about whether calculators should be used in the primary school, the head teacher will explain why it is appropriate. I accept that that would involve the fringes of the curriculum, but there is nothing wrong in that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is entirely right that, as a professional, the head teacher should explain why equipment or books should be used in the school. We must recognise that the wider responsibilities of the educaion authority and the limited responsibilities of the boards, because of their limited involvement in the curriculum, act as a restraint when reaching such conclusions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A home-loving boy such as myself does not want to go to Denmark to be told how it should be done? I want to stay in my constituency of Dumbarton. What advice would the Minister give to that school to resolve the problem of whether a novel is used in the curriculum?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to help the hon. Gentleman. It probably depends on the novel and its importance to the curriculum. If it could be argued that alternative books were available which would fulfill the functions of the curriculum, the school board would have the right to take such a view. However, if the book was central to the curricular aims as a whole, the board would not be within its rights. I believe that in practice such matters will be satisfactorily resolved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about a package of proposals for the capitation allowance which the head teacher will put to the board and which the board may, or may not, approve. The board is not in a position to put its own suggested package for consideration. The initiative lies with the head teacher and it is for the board to approve or not to approve. If the board does not approve or not to approve. If the board does not approve, there is no obligation on the head teacher to amend his proposals if he believes that a fundamental matter of principle is at stake. If there is no approval on the capitation allowance and it threatens the duties upon the education authority, there are provisions within the Bill to intervene.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The head teacher merely has to give an account to the board for his proposals on the capitation expenditure and requires its endorsement. I should have thought that Opposition Members would have accepted that as being reasonable. It is difficult to see how one could argue that a decision taken by the education authority—perhaps by the education committee, consisting of councillors who are remote from the school and the board—could in any way be more equitable, fair or reasonable than one that is reached by agreement between the head teacher and members of the school board as part of their deliberations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>422</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am still not sure which parts of the Bill will resolve that. The Minister mentioned the word "unreasonable". I do not have a legal background but I know that that is a favourite word of lawyers. Is the Minister saying that if a head teacher's action could be seen as unreasonable there might be litigation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It could go either way—it would depend who was at fault. The Secretary of State might be involved and action might be taken under section 70 of the 1980 Act. If the head teacher was unreasonably withholding a perfectly reasonable request from the school board for amendment to his proposals, he might be at fault. It would depend entirely on the circumstances. The point is that if a board behaves unreasonably there is provision in the Bill for it to be required to act in a different way—the hon. Gentleman used the word "overruled". Equally, the head teacher must take account of what the board suggests. Whether the head teacher or the board is at fault depends entirely upon the reasons put forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am still not sure which parts of the Bill will resolve that. The Minister mentioned the word "unreasonably". I do not have a legal background but I know that that is a favourite word of lawyers. Is the Minister saying that if a head teacher's action could be seen as unreasonable there might be litigation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall go over it again. There are provisions for the education authority to intervene where it is satisfied that its duty to ensure efficient and adequate education is being undermined. Equally, if the board operates in a way that is not consistent with the statutory duties of the education authority, as it is obliged to be, there is scope for the Secretary of State to intevene.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In practice, it will not be like that. In the vast majority of cases, the head teacher's proposals will be agreed by the board. Where there are suggestions for change they will be discussed, and where they are reasonable—the head teacher will no doubt wish to take account of them. Just as it would be unreasonable to argue that every school board would be unreasonable in its consideration of the head teacher's proposals, so it would be unreasonable to argue that every head teacher's proposals would be perfect. In giving head teachers, for the first time, freedom to have and to spend a capitation allowance as they consider appropriate, we are introducing an element of accountability. That accountability will be to the school board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members want decisions to be taken by councillors on education committees rather than by members of school boards. That argument has run like a copper thread throughout our debate. That means that they want decisions to be delegated upwards. The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) shakes his head, but that is what would happen if we were to accept his arguments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. The hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) has had a fair crack and will have the right to reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a previous debate the Minister said that the reason why the head teacher should not have a vote on the school board was that the head teacher might wish to disown the board's decisions. Surely we are here discussing exactly those circumstances. Is not the Minister really saying that if the head teacher does not get the board's approval he can carry on anyway? The procedures that he has elaborated are so long-winded that nothing, in fact, will happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not understand the hon. Gentleman's question. I argued that the head teacher should be independent of the board so that he could stand aside. If there were a disagreement that he could not resolve in relation to the capitation allowance, that is exactly what he would be doing. That seems entirely consistent, and not contradictory. The hon. Gentleman said that the head teacher would be able to carry on anyway, but that is not so. The capitation allowance will not be approved until the board approves it. If the head teacher feels that a major principle is at stake and that the board is acting beyond its powers and authority, he will be entitled to hold his ground.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the absence of agreement, there are provisions in the Bill to resolve a deadlock. Board members will be aware of that. They are accountable to parents, who will take a dim view of capitation expenditure not being determined by the board. So there will be pressure within the school on the board for matters to be resolved. That pressure will be sufficient to ensure that sensible and reasonable decisions are taken. The hon. Member for Gordon believes that the pressure can be obtained by delegating upwards to a remote education authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>indicated dissent.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman shakes his head. Does that mean that he does not support the amendment? If he dissents from my remarks and the head teacher is not accountable to the education authority or to the school board for his proposals on the capitation allowance, I should have thought that he was embarking on dangerous territory. Although we may agree on the importance of a head teacher to a school, few members of the Committee would argue that the head teacher is so important that he should be accountable to no one—neither the board nor the education authority—for important decisions on expenditure on books and equipment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If anyone is embarking on dangerous territory, it is the Minister. He is asking us to approve legislation which does not mean what it says. That is the thread of his argument. We all hope that the head teacher and the school board will agree on the capitation expenditure, but the amendments are concerned with what happens when
	<span class='label label-info column'>424</span>
agreement is not reached. The Minister's answers have not resolved that problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that where there is an impasse between the school board and the head teacher there are several mechanisms to allow that impasse to be overcome: the head teacher can ignore the school board's wishes if, in his professional judgment, the board's view is unreasonable; the education authority can override the school board if it believes that its statutory duties and responsibilities are undermined by the school board's views; and the Secretary of State for Scotland can intervene and overrule the school board if he believes that it is acting unreasonably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The headteacher … shall not spend funds on any proposal unless it is approved by the Board."</p></blockquote>
The Minister has spent the past half hour telling the Committee that that will not apply. Apparently, the head teacher can spend money on books not approved by the board if he believes that the board's objections are unreasonable, and the education authority or the Secretary of State has overruled the board. What the clause says is not what it means. If we allow it to pass into law, it will make bad law, and it is not part of the Committee's job to pass bad law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for allowing me to intervene.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Chairman, rather than the Minister, called the hon. Gentleman to speak. The Minister has enough power, without taking over the functions of the Chairman as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. Knox. Like a good soccer referee, you exercise your duties perfectly, without being noticed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the example of a disagreement between a head teacher and a school board over the book "Kes". The head teacher can apparently say, "I shall buy that book because it is consistent with my curricular aims," and then buy it, notwithstanding the comments of the school board, even though subsection (2)(b) says that he cannot spend anything without the board's approval. If that happened, would the case go to the local education authority? The possibility of legal action would arise, too. Finally, the Secretary of State, in all his majesty, would appear and pronounce on the book, saying either, "Yes, you can read it," or, "No, we shall burn it before your very eyes." I have given a concrete example. Would what I have described happen in such a case?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are presenting a fundamental argument about the relationship between the head teacher, the school board and the entire community. Parents, too, have an interest. They will see other parents choosing books on their behalf. We should like a clear, unequivocal answer from the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to give the hon. Gentleman a clear, unequivocal answer. My answer to the hon. Member for Dundee, East is that it is no
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0985">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>425</span>
part of the argument in Committee to take what I say, turn it around and say that it means something else. As the hon. Gentleman says, the clause is clear, but perhaps he will turn his mind to clause 8(5), which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the exercise of any functions given to them by or under this Act, a School Board shall ensure that any duty of their education authority under statue or any rule of law is duly complied with."</p></blockquote>
Boards are required to do that in all circumstances. So, in considering whether to approve the head teacher's capitation expenditure, the board has to take account of the statutory obligations of the education authority, which, under the 1980 Education Act, includes a requirement to ensure adequate and efficient provision of education. Clearly, if books and equipment are not being purchased for the school because of a deadlocked disagreement between the board and the head teacher, the education authority could argue that its duties were being breached and the board had become liable to criticism under clause 8(5).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position is crystal clear. We are not producing law that does not say what it means or mean what it says, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will acknowledge that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that the school board will be competent to refuse the head teacher's proposed capitation expenditure only if it keeps within the statutory duties imposed on the education authority. The key phrase was that the education authority had to ensure an adequate and efficient provision of education in its area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) cites a dispute over a book. Who would decide whether that dispute would lead the education authority to breach its statutory duties if the impasse continued? The Minister must make that clear. There has to be a mechanism for determining when the school board is acting competently and when it is acting incompetently. Does the Minister suggest that that mechanism is provided by the education authority committee? Will that committee simply say that the school board is acting outside its competence and override its objection? Or does the school board have a right of appeal beyond the education authority committee to another body?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Secretary of State for Scotland decide whether a school board is acting competently in refusing to accept a head teacher's expenditure proposals? Will it be the courts? Will schools be dragged through the courts, with lawyers arguing for the education authority against the school board, and so on? The Minister must make clear what the mechanism is for resolving such impasses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The mechanism to determine the law is the courts. It is not a matter for the Secretary of State. All statutory bodies operate under obligations. If they do not meet obligations, they may find themselves in court. That includes local authorities and education authorities. It is
	<span class='label label-info column'>426</span>
because the courts exist and because school boards and education authorities are required to comply with statute that we are able to sit here today and organise our education system. There is nothing new or remarkable in that. The hon. Gentleman's first question was whether there is adequate protection to ensure that boards operate in a reasonable way and that reasonable proposals from head teachers are not rejected. He has now answered his own question. He acknowledged that there is provision within the Act for that purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) is concerned about the book. The current position is that such a book might not be available to schools if an education authority so decides. The only change we are making is to change the position whereby education authorities have the discretion whether to make money available for books and equipment. They are required to do so, and the head teacher can draw up his proposals and seek the approval of the school board. If the school board does not want a particular book, it would be a matter for discussion with the head teacher about a possible substitute that he judges appropriate for the delivery of the curriculum. That seems entirely straightforward. No doubt it would be possible for the school board to discuss that. I should be extremely surprised if matters proceed to the extent that the default powers—the back-up powers that I have mentioned—come into play. We expect people to behave reasonably and to reach a reasonable decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>indicated dissent.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) shakes his head. I do not understand why he thinks that councillors elected to education authorities are perfect and will always behave reasonably and that parents on school boards will not behave reasonably, even though they will be accountable to their fellow parents for election and, in the majority of cases, will have children at the relevant school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have struck the right balance between the appropriate involvement of the board in decisions and the professional aspect of capitation as a contributory element in forming the school curriculum. Just in case we have wound up Opposition Members too much on this matter, if there is no agreement on the capitation allowance it is always open to the education authority to provide the books and equipment. We are really having a debate about not very much in particular.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is evident that the Minister is in deep trouble on this set of amendments. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> He may laugh. My hon. Friends and I do not mind being treated with contempt. It is the issues that matter. A Committee's function is to examine a Bill and hope that its conclusions improve the Bill. The Minister and his advisers are seeking a way out of the dilemma, but the construction of the clause is a mess. The amendments are designed to help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 8(5) states that school boards must have cognisance of statutes or any rule of law. That is essential, but clause 9(2)(b) states that a head teacher
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0986">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>427</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall not spend funds on any proposal unless it is approved by the Board".</p></blockquote>
The Minister and his advisers should put their heads together and sort out the legislation that provides the wider context within which this Bill will operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The example given by my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) is important. The Minister spoke at length but said nothing to try to clarify what cannot be clarified. It would be a major mistake if the Bill were enacted unamended. For the first time in a long while, the education system could be exploited through the courts. It is all very well to say, "Good will will prevail, there are no baddies around and we shall reach a consensus", but we are dealing with legislation for the nation and—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, not at this stage. If the Bill is passed unamended, we shall face major difficulties. We need clarification, because the Minister has said nothing to resolve our fears that this is bad legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am worried about the decision to implement a curriculum, including the policy to teach sex education in schools. A decision may be taken at education authority level that there should be sex education in schools and that it should cover family planning, contraception, abortion and AIDS, for example. Head teachers could be allowed to purchase the necessary books and materials to implement that policy, but school boards may then refuse to agree to such proposals and create an impasse. The Minister said that the education authority could claim that it had a statutory responsibility to lay down what should be taught in schools and could override the school boards. The school boards could appeal against the education authority's decision and take it to court. Schools could be dragged to court by school boards and perhaps by outside bodies such as the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children, which could use the procedure as a publicity mechanism. Does the Minister concede that that would be possible under the Bill as drafted?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has got who takes who to court the wrong way round, but I get the gist of what he is saying. He uses the example of sex education, which I acknowledge might be controversial. It may be that the school board will tell a head teacher that a particular book or video is not the best way of presenting information to children. There is nothing wrong with a discussion leading to a search for an alternative method. The Catholic church educational commission wrote to all its schools forbidding them to show the Government's video on AIDS because it considered it too explicit. I am disappointed, but he commission suggests that other material is available to make the dangers of AIDS, and the way that it is spread, known to children. That is a matter for judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill's provisions for action by the Secretary of State for Scotland would come into effect when the
	<span class='label label-info column'>428</span>
delivery of the curriculum is threatened and a board is not ensuring due compliance with the education authority's statutory duties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has chosen a splendid example. There is nothing wrong with parents being able to comment on material used in schools to deliver the curriculum, or suggest to the headmaster that they will not approve it unless he can convince them otherwise, provided that the withholding of their approval does not prejudice the wider functions and responsibilities of the education authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In extremis, the local authority could provide material other than through the head teacher and the capitation allowance, which is all that we are discussing. We are not discussing all the resources available within a school. The education authority would still have freedom. However, it would be an unwise education authority that did not take account of the views of parents on such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman can be reasonably reassured that the sort of catastrophe that he has outlined could not occur. There is adequate protection within the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The Minister may wave his hand, but I should support parents in their right to do that, although it would create difficulties in a denominational school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps we are arguing about a difficulty that does not exist. By prescription in the Bill, parents have no say about the content of the curriculum. If a book is part of the curriculum, would parents have no right to object to it or to ban it? Parents have only the right to be consulted on the curriculum and advised about its content.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Resources are likely to be scarce. Perhaps it will be impossible for a school to buy all the materials that it would like to during a year. Is the provision intended to allow school boards to prioritise expenditure proposals on books and materials? That is reasonable. One person's priorities may differ from another's, even, indeed, from the head teacher's. Priorities are a matter of opinion, but the content of the curriculum is not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Presumably, the Minister favours a national curriculum, such as that proposed for England and Wales. Presumably, one will come to Scotland at some stage. I understand that the Labour party is not opposed to that. Establishing such a curriculum involves an enormous amount of work, both nationally and by education departments. I do not think that the Minister seriously suggests that the endeavour and resources put in to providing appropriate materials for the curriculum should be set aside at the whim of parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister thinks that parents will be reasonable. We all expect that, but we cannot guarantee it. We are trying to provide for occasions when people are

not reasonable, behave in a prejudiced and ignorant way and so prejudice the education of children at the school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have some sympathy with the problems of the Minister and his officials in this instance. I have received representations from school councils which have complained that their right to be consulted did not give them the ultimate right to influence decisions. They were brushed aside and ignored, and were left wondering why they were consulted at all. The Minister would probably support that argument and maintain that the clause is designed to ensure that parents will have powers to be consulted that cannot be brushed aside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the dilemma of trying to strengthen the role of parents to give them influence, while trying to achieve a balance that does not give them too much influence. I should be surprised if that genuine dilemma were not discussed openly and actively by those drafting the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has now clarified—I may have hit the nail on the head here—that a head teacher may say, "I wish to put forward these proposals". The board may then say, "We do not like X, Y and Z and we think that you should take them out". If the head teacher replies, "I am not prepared to do that as I need them", an impasse is reached. There is no agreement and so the capitation fees are effectively frozen. A state of limbo exists, which may create pressure on both sides to secure an agreement. The longer that that continues, the more damaging it could be for the school by escalating the division and leaving the school unfunded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that in 90, 95 or 99 per cent, of cases, the problem will be resolved. In areas like mine, where school councils have worked well, there will be a constructive dynamic, but we should consider the small core of cases where the problem may not be resolved and may escalate. It has been clarified that ultimately the balance of argument is likely to favour the head teacher, although it may be a drawn-out process before that is so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not asking that amendment No. 61 be accepted, but its spirit aims at putting the onus of proof on the board to show that the head teacher was being unreasonable, rather than, as in the Bill, putting the onus on the head teacher to prove that the board was being unreasonable. I accept that our debate has a nice balance. I do not wish to go to the wall on the amendment, but the Minister may have got the balance wrong. So in a minority of cases—though serious and divisive—there may be real conflict, during which the school will not have funding. There may also be considerable division that cannot be resolved easily.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am following the hon. Gentleman's speech carefully and, without wishing to damage him, he has hit the nail very much on the head. I have considerable sympathy with his arguments. But how will his amendment have the effect, as he suggests, of putting the onus on the board to show that the head teacher was at fault?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>430</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to explain that. I am not defending the exact wording of the amendment, and the Minister would not expect me to do so. Clause 9(2)(b) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall not spend funds on any proposal unless it is approved by the Board."</p></blockquote>
Amendment No. 61 seeks to replace that with
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall take into consideration the views of the Board in deciding upon such spending."</p></blockquote>
If the head teacher has not taken into consideration the board's views, he is open to some kind of accountability. But the amendment turns the obligation round. Instead of saying that the head teacher cannot do anything until the board approves, the board must decide that the head teacher cannot go ahead because he has been unreasonable. That puts the onus on the board and gives it the authority to press. I am sure that parliamentary draughtsmen, who have much more skill than me, could find words to convey that sentiment, but I have outlined the basic difference of emphasis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that there is a nice balance, but the Bill is in danger of going further than necessary. If the Minister were honest, he would admit that the interpretation of the Bill is unclear and that we are not absolutely sure how it will work. Most reasonable people will resolve their differences, but if they do not the present wording of the Bill is potentially more divisive than an amendment similar to mine, which simply turns the obligation around. I do not expect the Minister to accept the amendment, but I hope that he will take the point on board and consider whether the clause needs to be clarified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have sympathy with the view expressed by the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to a different point, which the Minister made when he replied to my last contribution. He said that the powers of the school boards apply to the capitation expenditure only and that the eduction authority has other financial powers that enable it to provide any books and materials it wants against the wishes of the school board. I shall take the Minister through another scenario to see if that would be the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose that the education authority is Conservative controlled and that it has synpathy with the moral majority group, which is beginning to grow in this country as it did recently in the United States. It decides that "The Silent Scream", the video made by the Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child, should form part of the teaching materials provided to schools. The school board refuses to accept "The Silent Scream" in its school. The education authority insists, the school board will not give way, and the education authority takes the school board to court. The school board wins the case and the court says that the education authority would not be in breach of its statutory responsibility if it failed to provide that video in the school. Could the education authority, in defiance of the wishes of the school board, impose the video by using the head teacher, who is its agent in the school? It could impose its will through other means than capitation expenditure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The significance of the amendments has been heightened by the debate, which has highlighted the professional judgment of the head teacher. The amendments seek to give the benefit of the doubt to the head teacher and the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister talks about a better world in which disputes will be reconciled. He has been adept at putting the debate on to a frictionless surface, but we have successfully introduced gravity to it. He mentioned clause 8(5) as a defence, but that specifically refers to statutory duty. I refer again to my favourite book, Minister, which would not come in under clause 8(5).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am flattered by the hon. Gentleman's continual reference to me as the Minister, which I am not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. Knox. My leader, my hon. Friend the Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg), will deal with me afterwards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reference to clause 8(5) does not help us, because clause 9(2)(b) says that the head teacher
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall not spend funds on any proposal unless it is approved by the Board."</p></blockquote>
The Minister should take the issue to heart and give us an idea as to how it will be resolved. A Pandora's box is opening before us because we do not know what will happen at the end of the day. I stress that the Minister must provide a mechanism to deal with disputes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This debate has been a storm in a teacup. We have been discussing the matter for I do not know how long and the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) is still asking me perfectly straightforward questions and building them up as if there were some great mystery about the answer. He asked about the position regarding a video such as "The Silent Scream". It would be possible for members of the school board to take the view that showing that film was not appropriate and that the head teacher should not purchase such a video.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be free.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg) points out, it would be free. Therefore, the question does not arise in that respect—although postage might be charged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the board overturned the purchase of such a video, the hon. Member for Dundee, East assumed that the issue would go to court and that my right honourable and learned Friend the Secretary of State would take a default action. My right honourable and learned Friend is a wise gentleman and I do not think that he would find himself in court on such a matter. Nevertheless the hon. Gentleman presented that scenario and his question was whether the education authority, having rejected the decision of the school board and having been successful in the courts, would be entitled to send the video to the school anyway, through the head teacher. The answer is yes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are simply talking about the decisions that are taken on the capitation allowance in the school and
	<span class='label label-info column'>432</span>
which are put to the school board by the head teacher. The hon. Gentleman has very little to be alarmed about and he has worked the Committee into a lather unnecessarily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) almost persuaded me. I do not mind admitting that he went through the arguments that we have had about finding the right balance. He is right that there is an anxiety, which he was gracious enough to acknowledge, that if we simply give the school boards the right to be consulted, it will be easy to ignore them in the way in which education authorities have ignored school councils. If the boards have no teeth or ability to intervene beyond the right of consultation it is difficult to see how true involvement can be created. We have tried to frame the legislation to meet that anxiety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that the hon. Gentlemen almost persuaded me, but he did not take into account the point that I have just made to the hon. Member for Dundee, East. The education authority can provide books and equipment in the absence of agreement. The hon. Member for Gordon was good enough to acknowledge that, in the vast majority of cases, that would not happen and that there be deadlock in a minority of cases only. If there was a deadlock, the education authority would be under a legal duty to provide the books and equipment as part of its wider duties to provide adequate and efficient education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no problem in the sense that the hon. Member for Dundee, East and other hon. Members have tried to imply, namely, that somehow there will be a breakdown in the provision of books, equipment and education within the school. There are adequate safeguards and I believe that we have found the right balance in meeting the point made by the hon. Member for Gordon. We have given the boards a say of which note must be taken without going the whole hog and doing as the Danes have done by giving them the right to determine the books and material within the school. I hope that on that basis the amendment will be withdrawn and that we might even enlist the support of the hon. Member for Gordon if the matter was pressed to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 189, in page 7, line 19, after "school", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"but shall provide the School Board with an opportunity to advise on those policies".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will judge that this is a reasonable amendment and will accept it or at least consider tabling a similar amendment on Report. The justification for the amendment is simple. At present it is the task of head teachers to formulate school policies on curriculum, assessment, discipline, rules and uniform in accordance with guidelines and policy statements issued by the education authority. It is important that the role of the education authority in formulating policy at school level is not overlooked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a brief contribution in the previous debate I mentioned the importance of developing a national curriculum. If we accept that concept in principle, there must be standardisation across schools both at primary and secondary level to ensure that the principles enshrined within the changes are properly followed. My former education authority, Fife, has some 23 secondary schools and more than 100 primary schools—I cannot remember the exact number because there is always a new one being opened or an odd little one being closed. Clearly education policy has to be co-ordinated effectively across such a large number of schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also essential—especially at this time of great change in the curriculum and in assessment—to develop assessment procedures, materials and so on centrally. That means economies of scale. To leave each secondary school to develop its own course material, may be laudable in principle, but would be difficult in practice. That has already been experienced by most education authorities when trying to come to terms with the new standard grade. Many authorities certainly at the beginning of this year, had great difficulty in meeting their obligations in some subjects due to the sheer volume of work involved. It is effective to centralise use of resources and we ought to recognise that by including the provision suggested by the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may say that clause 8(5) covers the point and that, therefore, there is no need to enlarge upon it. It is true that clause 8(5) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the exercise of any functions given to them by or under this Act, a School Board shall ensure that any duty of their education authority under statute or any rule of law is duly complied with."</p></blockquote>
However, it does not necessarily hold true that a head teacher will always give advice to his board which is exactly in accord with the policy that has been laid down. Therefore, it is important to put in an extra provision. It will not necessarily affect curriculum and assessment, although goodness knows what the Minister will be proposing on assessment. We await that with great interest and will be covering it in amendment No. 134.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the more tenous area of discipline and school uniform, it is important that the law is complied
	<span class='label label-info column'>434</span>
with. There are problems in certain schools that come within the education authority in my constituency where unreasonable restrictions on children's dress are applied. Perhaps the Minister, as a libertarian, agrees that children should be allowed to dress as they wish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>indicated dissent.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister shakes his head, but he has always been portrayed as a luminary of the new Right and of the libertarian school of philosophy. I suggest that he consults his hon. Friends the Members for Billericay (Mrs. Gorman) and for Mid-Worcestershire (Mr. Forth) to ascertain what being a true libertarian implies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem of school uniform will not just disappear. The unnecessary restrictions on the wearing of uniforms in some schools have no foundation in law, nor in the policy of education authorities, but are imposed on the whim of head teachers. It is important that school boards should be advised whether such restrictions are in the interests of a school and are in accordance with the law and with education policy. The question creates considerable friction and means problems for the many children in my constituency whose parents have great difficulty in providing them with appropriate school uniform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister consider the amendment—or one like it—sympathetically and ensure that policy, as expounded to the school board, is in accordance with that of the education authority?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy (Dr. Moonie). I was bewildered by his reason for tabling the amendment but slightly reassured by what he said. He wanted to be certain that the head teacher's policies for the school would be framed within the overall broad policy aims of the education authority. On that basis, the amendment is unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman strayed into the area of school uniforms, which suggested that the intention of the amendment might have been slightly broader. It would require head teachers and the boards to work to the diktats of the education authority on every detail of school policy. If that is what he is thinking—although I am sure that he is too nice to have such a terrible thought—it is unacceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we give the hon. Gentleman's intentions the benefit of the doubt, he can be reassured that the Bill already meets his requirements. If he intends to go further, that would be contrary to the spirit of the Bill and he could not expect me to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to mention a small problem regarding school uniforms. Does the Minister accept that it is against the law to stipulate a uniform? It may desirable to have one—indeed, education authorities may believe it desirable—but there is no legal compulsion for a child to wear a particular form of uniform to school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be difficult to enforce, apart from anything else. However, some education
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0990">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>435</span>
authorities take it upon themselves to express views on school uniform. We believe that it should be left to the boards and the schools themselves to decide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is correct when he argues that a child cannot be forced to wear a school uniform, but that does not mean that a school should not have a policy of encouraging uniforms. One of the benefits is that it is cheaper to dress children in a school uniform than in many of the alternatives that are available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 160 is unnecessary and unacceptable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for leaving the Committee briefly to make a quick phone call.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the Minister for giving me the opportunity to speak to this amendment. In the previous debate I tried to restrain him, but in this debate I wish to push him a little further. The purpose of amendment No. 189 is to ensure that the school board plays a more active role in advising on important policies. I tabled the amendment because parents involved on school councils have told me over the years about their frustration at not having more input and influence. I wish to strengthen the clause a little to ensure that parents have an opportunity to have more influence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Kirkcaldy (Dr. Moonie) spoke about school uniform. Whatever the arguments about it, it provides a good example of where interaction is crucial between parents and schools in matters such as discipline, rules and uniform. The views of parents on school uniform, for example, are important. They may say that uniforms are beneficial in terms of cost and removing obvious social differences, or that a freer attitude could be taken. Parents like to contribute to that sort of legitimate debate. My amendment tries to ensure that they are consulted and can play an advisory role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that an interaction should operate between parents and schools on issues such as curriculum and assessment. In my area parents have expressed views to me about assessment. They are anxious to have reports from head teachers on how schools are doing collectively and individual reports on how their children are doing within the limits of their ability. They wish to know whether their children are fulfilling themselves, but they are not keen on statistical assessment of individual pupils' roles and performances. That is another legitimate issue for debate on which parents' views are important, although in my area parents' views do not accord with those of the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we wished to introduce a Bill to strengthen school councils, the clause would be crucial. Therefore, I broadly support the clause. Given that I prefer to give school councils a responsible role, I am anxious to ensure that school boards will at least have the powers that school councils wish to have accorded to them. The amendment may be slightly unusual, because I wish to push the Minister further down the road that he is taking, rather than restrain him as I wished to do when we were considering the previous group of amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>436</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether I am changing my attitude or whether the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) is changing his. I hope that I am not changing mine, but I listen to the hon. Gentleman with increasing agreement. He asked me to go further down the road that I have embarked on, but will he move further down the page? Clause 10(4) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The School Board may make representations with regard to information, statements and reports provided under this section to the education authority and to the headteacher who shall take account of those representations and shall reply to them."</p></blockquote>
As that includes curriculum, assessment of pupils, discipline, rules and uniform, will the hon. Gentleman explain the thinking behind his amendment, which seems to be covered by clause 10(4)?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The sentiment of my amendment is that parents should be consulted before rather than after. Subsection (4) implies that representations will be made after the head teacher has made his report rather than being an interactive part of the process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is essential that parents should be consulted by the head teacher and at least be able to advise him as he is formulating his policy rather than having to complain after he has done so and hope that it can be changed. It is a matter of timing and ensuring that parents are involved from the outset and not left to react to the end result.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a valiant effort. If ever there was a plea for retrospective legislation, that would be it. The school boards would come into existence with these policies already in place. We cannot enable the boards to make representations before policies are established, and policies will have already been established.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 10(4) does not prevent a board making representations in advance of the statement on any of the matters included in clause 10(2). Such matters will be discussed from time to time and the head teacher will take account of that. The purpose of subsection (2) is to provide a set time in the year when statements have to be made and properly considered. No doubt deliberation will continue beyond that time within the school board, just as deliberation on such matters continues on a day-to-day basis in the Scottish Education Department. Even now, we are considering issued such as assessment, as the hon. Gentleman said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that the sentiments behind the hon. Gentleman's amendment are important, but they are provided for in the Bill. I am anxious to avoid cluttering the Bill because we have tried to make it sensible and coherent. Therefore, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: School uniform does not provide a convenient means of standardising the appearance of pupils. Anyone who has attended a school whose uniform includes the compulsory wearing of a blazer knows only too well the difference in quality and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0991">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>437</span>
appearance between the blazer that the Minister and I could afford to purchase for our children and the blazer provided for less fortunate children. That is well known and is resented by the children involved and their parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister imagines that because both blazers are black the difference in the cut is not apparent, he has little idea of what modern dress is about. Nor is it a cheap way of providing a child with something to wear, because it is an addition to what he would wear anyway. It is expensive, not cheap. The Minister, in all decency, should recognise that. Children no longer go out at weekends and after school wearing their blazers; quite the reverse. However, they are neatly and attractively clad.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that it should not be compulsory for a child to wear school uniform, and I shall make great use of that in future to support my views on the subject. However, in view of his generous statement, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 134, in page 7, line 22, leave out from beginning to "and" in line 24 and insert 	<br><blockquote><p>"such reports, including an annual report."</p></blockquote>
This is a probing amendment to discover the Minister's intentions. Clause 10(3) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"an annual report, including in particular a report on the level of attainment of the pupils in the school".</p></blockquote>
I can imagine a droll headmaster saying, "The attainment is OK." That would constitute a report on the attainment of pupils in the school. It might not please parents, but nothing in the Act would compel head teachers to say anything further on the subject. If the subsection is to retain a reference to levels of attainment, it needs improvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder whether the Minister may be jumping the gun, and whether the measure might more appropriately be included in the Bill that I suppose he will introduce next year on assessment in schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not clear what form a report on the level of attainment of pupils in a school would take, or what comparative statistics would be used to compile it. It is not even clear whether schools are currently capable of producing such a report. I am certain that the Minister will tell us that the report will not include reference to the attainment of individual pupils. But what exactly is intended? It is difficult to provide coherent and understandable aggregate information on attainment. Children's individual reports are the concern of the staff, the education authority and parents, who receive an individual report on the progress and attainment of their child annually. In primary schools such reports are based on broad banding, but they are adequate to show whether a child is working satisfactorily. The situation becomes more difficult in a secondary school with up to 2,000 pupils. What will be considered an appropriate level of attainment? What form of banding will be used? Will the information provided involve the usual crude statistics trotted out on numbers of passes and
	<span class='label label-info column'>438</span>
the grades attained at higher or sixth-year studies level, for example? A vast statistical analysis is involved in producing any reasoned report on the attainment of pupils in a school of that size. I should like the Minister to tell us in detail what it is proposed would happen under the subsection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed by the amendment. I should have thought that the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy (Dr. Moonie) would welcome the board being given details of the levels of attainment in the school. Implicit in his remarks was a sort of—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister goes any further I must tell him that I did not say whether I welcomed the proposal. I said that I was moving a probing amendment in order to seek information. The Minister should not attribute to me statements that I have not made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the hon. Gentleman. I thought that he had tabled the amendment hoping that I should accept it, and that it would remove the requirement for a report on the levels of attainment in the school. If the hon. Gentleman is saying that he is content for such a report to be made to the board I welcome that, and am happy to grovel apologetically for having thought the worst of him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the hon. Gentleman's arguments were rather worrying, but I can give him the assurance that he sought that the report will not refer to the levels of attainment of individual children. Regulation 10(3) of the Schools (General) Scotland regulations 1975 prohibits a head teacher from disclosing to any unauthorised person information from the record of an individual pupil which includes records on the pupil's educational progress. So there is no question of the report being used to provide details about individual pupils. It will provide an overall picture in the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that the provision might be better in next year's Education Bill. I know of no such Government commitment, and I cannot anticipate the Queen's Speech. Whatever may emerge in terms of proposals on curriculum and assessment, there will still be a need for reports on attainment in the school. I am shocked that the hon. Gentleman regards attainment in such narrow, academic terms. The Opposition are embarrassed by academic performance and become anxious when it is suggested that such information be made available. One expects broader measures of attainment to be made in the report from the head teacher to the school board. The hon. Gentleman must exercise his imagination a little.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have assured the hon. Gentleman that there will be no reports on individual pupils but on broadly based levels of attainment, which we expect to include academic attainment and examination results.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to hear the Minister say that no reports on the level of attainment of

	<span class='label label-info column'>439</span>
individual pupils will be made available to school boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the purpose of the clause? Why give two school boards reports of aggregate attainment within a school? Is it a measure by which the performance of the head teacher and other teachers in the school can be judged or a measure by which the performance of one school can be compared with that of another in the same district? That implies the encouragement within education in Scotland of magnet schools with high levels of academic attainment and sink schools with low levels of academic attainment. The parents' charter will encourage parents to move their children from sink schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that schools will not be judged solely on academic criteria. He said that the higher grade results, the standard grade results, the number of merit and general passes, as opposed to foundation passes, will all be taken into account. He mentioned broader measures but the details were left to the imagination. What other broader measures of attainment will be included in the head teachers' report to school boards?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If every school in an area is to have a report on the aggregate attainment in that school, will those reports be adjusted to take account of the pupil intake? A great deal of research has been done on that. It shows that the academic attainment in individual schools does not depend mainly on the quality of the teaching staff but on the quality of the intake of pupils, so it is important that any reports containing aggregate levels of attainment should be adjusted to take account of the intake of pupils. Differences between schools are reduced tremendously if the pupil intake is taken into consideration. It is then more difficult for those with a political bias to argue that one school is better than another because it has better exam results. By "better" I mean able to perfom well in academic examinations and not in any other sense. Edcuation research has shown that children from particular social backgrounds do better at the sort of middle class academic examinations that, at the moment, are the only criteria by which children are judged in Scottish education, although that is changing.

Changes towards a better way of assessing children will be handicapped and hampered if the Minister allows bare examination results to be the only means by which children are assessed in higher or standard grade passes. Will the Minister outline what broader measures of attainment will be taken into consideration in the reports, and will he guarantee that steps will be taken to ensure that the levels of aggregate attainment in schools are adjusted to take account of intake?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have heard it all now. A Labour Member of Parliament is telling the Committee that because some children come from a particular social background their academic attainment will be limited.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>440</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Research shows that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that research shows that. No doubt he has been reading articles in 	<i>The Scotsman</i> or the 	<i>Glasgow Herald.</i> As any teacher, and even the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall), will confirm, the most important factor in children's achievement is their expectations of what they can achieve. If people like the hon. Gentleman go round telling people "Because you come from a particular background, you are not going to achieve a certain level of success," they condemn those children in advance to a particular level of attainment. The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) should think carefully before drawing such conclusions from reaseach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the reasons that we wish levels of attainent to be reported to school boards is so that parents can investigate such arguments and question the head teacher about levels of performance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister always twists what has been said in Committee when he sees the opportunity to make cheap political points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I speak from experience when I say that children who come from a stable background and a secure environment—with parents who take a great deal of interest in their children's education, make books available in the home and coach their children—do better in academic examinations than children who come from broken homes, with parents who do not take a direct interest in their education and in which no books are available. People from a working class background are not always unable to achieve academically. I come from a working class background, as does the Minister, and we both achieved well within the system. However, in general, children do less well academically if they have parents who do not take an interest, and if they live in damp and overcrowded conditions without access to books or to all the things that the middle class takes for granted. If the Minister says that that is not true, he should point out research that says so. I can point to research that says that that is true.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will have to consider the research. I think that he refers to the research in Edinburgh and the article that appeared about it in the Scottish press the other day. The argument was that, primarily, secondary schools intake is deficient in some cases because some children have not achieved the necessary levels of attainment at primary level. That is another reason why we wish reports to be made in primary schools. Parents should be able to make judgments about the reasons put forward for the level of attainment in schools. The Edinburgh research goes much further than the hon. Gentleman suggests. I am pleased, however, that the hon. Gentleman acknowledges that he managed to climb a particular ladder and is not quick trying to kick the ladder away or argue that others cannot climb it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend the Minister agree that it is not the quality of the building—either

the school or the home—that matters? It is nonsense to suggest that people who live in council houses, in whatever conditions, will be deprived or depressed in any way and not achieve well in education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I grew up in two rooms in a tenement. My parents had eight children, and that was not unusual in our tenement. Every child who grew up there was an achiever. That was not because the conditions were good—in fact, they were appalling—but because parents took an interest in their children. One is now a professor, two are senior officers in the services, and others are directors of substantial companies. I like to think that I have also made a contribution. Does my hon. Friend the Minister agree that we constantly have to face Left-wing nonsense?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker). I was not aware of the circumstances in which he grew up, but I now understand why he speaks for the ordinary folk of Scotland in a way that the Labour party does not. The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) has the nerve to argue that parental involvement and concern affects levels of attainment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree, so why is the hon. Gentleman at pains to argue against measures that provide more parental involvement?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The measures contained in the Bill provide greater involvement for only a few parents. As usual, the majority of parents will be excluded from any control over the school. Between four and seven parents will be given all powers on behalf of the others. The Bill does not greatly increase parents' ability to influence what happens in schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman reads on, he will find that boards have specific obligations to increase direct parental involvement. He will find it difficult to sustain his argument. If I develop that point, you will call me to order, Mr. Knox.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have been fairly generous so far in this discussion. I might have drawn the line if everyone had intended to make a personal declaration of his achievements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can assure you, Mr. Knox, that I shall not do that, because I have not been supplied with the necessary briefing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East argued that the necessity to provide a statement of attainment was a plot to create magnet schools. Magnet schools already exist. The hon. Gentleman finds them an embarrassment, and some of his colleagues wish to close them. He has clearly studied educational research, but if he examines the research conducted for the Scottish Education Department, he will learn that placing requests are not always made for academic reasons. Discipline and the ethos within a
	<span class='label label-info column'>442</span>
school are also attractive to parents and the head teacher is required to make a statement on those issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman rightly said that I had not listed the broader measures, and implied that the Government had not thought about them. I said that Opposition Members have little imagination if they cannot think of them, but I am happy to prompt their imagination. I should expect a statement to include issues such as attainment in social, cultural and physical skills. Details of attainment in academic performance should go beyond examination results and pick up on the general, continuous assessment within the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The statement of attainment is an opportunity for a head teacher to explain what is going well or badly in his school, and how he intends to correct problems or capitalise on achievements. That is appropriate for all organisations, and the fact that it does not yet happen in schools is a major deficiency of the system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with interest to the Minister's comments. When I hear the level of intellectual rigour that the Minister applies to his arguments, I understand why those of us who attended St. Andrews 20 years ago held members of the arts faculty in such contempt. Maybe the Minister learnt in a different place from me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should lay to rest the idea that what holds people from poor backgrounds back is their lack of will to change their circumstances. That has no basis in fact. There is no research to back up that conclusion. From many years of examining this subject, I know of innumerable studies which show the ill effects that poverty, social disadvantage, broken homes, lack of heating and inadequate diet have on health, well-being and intellectual attainment. It is remarkable not that so many manage to shrug off that background and be successful, but that so few are given the chance to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will give a practical illustration. A few year's ago I watched my son's football team play a team from a poor part of town. I realised to my surprise that the boys on my son's side were on average six inches taller than the boys of the same age on the other side. That is true not only in Scotland, but also in England. The work of Rutter and others on the attainment of children shows clearly the disadvantage that poverty confers on people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why I am delighted—although that is perhaps gilding the lily a little—with the Minister's statement that he will be looking for broad-based measures of attainment, including social, cultural and other vital aspects. I am glad that they will not be confined to the inaccurate and narrow basis of academic attainment. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
