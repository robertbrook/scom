	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 71, in page 2, line 9, after 'social', insert 'economic'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is not an earth-shattering suggestion, but it is an important amendment in the context of the clause—[	<i>Interruption</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The honourable Gentleman should be allowed to move his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Martin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to ensure that the economic environment is considered as part of any housing-led regeneration. The justification for it is that we believe that area renewal creates an opportunity to improve both the physical environment and the quality of life. It is an attempt slightly to widen the horizons of the new agency and make its powers under the clause more flexible. It is in the Government's interests that they should consider doing that. There is no compulsion, and no additional difficulty will be laid on the plate of those organising the developments. Therefore it is a sensible suggestion at least to consider. It is essential that economic considerations and, in particular job opportunities are taken into account alongside and given equal status to the physical, social and recreational aspects of areas being considered for renewal. The whole area should be treated as a package.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The housing association, certainly in my area, has its roots in the local communities and has quite a good track record for becoming involved in the community which it seeks to serve. Indeed, I can think of one case in Glasgow, at Queens Cross, where the housing association has sponsored community businesses as part of its package of redevelopment, to the great benefit of the local community, the association and those running the community businesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am very keen on community businesses. I have been instrumental in trying to set one up in my own constituency in Hawick and I know how positive they can be in getting people, particularly the long-term unemployed, back to work. But it is so much easier if that housing association involvement means that recreational, social and accommodation facilities go cheek by jowl with small-scale
	<span class='label label-info column'>136</span>
workshops, because they all come together to supplement the development in a way that cannot otherwise be achieved. It encourages people to become involved in community businesses as well as physically providing homes for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would ensure that exciting and successful developments of that kind that have been undertaken by far-sighted housing associations and community businesses in the past should be enabled to continue. I hope that the Minister will think carefully about the amendment. It would not cost him a great deal to concede it. On the other hand, it would make a significant difference in the specific situations that I have described and could spawn a much wider move in this direction, which would be beneficial to communities throughout Scotland. I hope that the Minister will consider the amendment on that basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise briefly to support the principle of the amendment proposed by the honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood). If we are seeking a vehicle for the comprehensive redevelopment of housing areas in Scotland, be they large or small, the development of the economy must be an important part of that strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier this week, we had debates about the shortcomings of large peripheral housing estates. One of the things that are wrong with those estates is that they have been planned simply to provide housing, with precious little consideration being given to the provision of shops, recreation facilities, community centres, doctors' surgeries or employment. They are simply blocks of housing, and people must go away from them to avail themselves of services or to obtain employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly we need a fresh approach to this kind of planning. We have already discussed environmental redevelopment and the provision of community facilities. The amendment would enable Scottish Homes to take account of and become directly involved in the economic development of such areas. I recognise that responsibilities might overlap between local authorities, the Scottish Development Agency and Scottish Homes, and I am always reluctant to let that happen, but we are dealing with a genuine and serious problem in some areas, and there is a need for a co-ordinated approach. In some areas, Scottish Homes might be the appropriate body to fund and organise such an approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities can do it if they have the wherewithal. I can think of one useful example in my own constituency East Lothian district council, redeveloping an area in the centre of the town of Musselburgh, built some new houses and, in association with those houses, small workshops, so that the houses could be let to people who wanted to run small businesses. They were starter units for small businesses and full-scale commerce in conjunction with houses to let. It has been an extremely attractive development, and I should like to see many more of the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0155">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>137</span>
Local authorities can do it, but if Scottish Homes is to be the funding and co-ordinating body for housing development in Scotland in future, it is important that it takes into account the economic development of housing areas in Scotland in addition to all the other considerations that we have spoken about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened with care to the honourable Members for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) and for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson). I was interested in what the honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire said about the Queens Cross housing association and agree very much with him. Interestingly enough, I have just this morning received a letter from the director of that housing association, who had raised with me a new housing initiative. He writes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am delighted to say that the outstanding mattes preventing the acceptance of the tender for the above scheme appears to have been resolved and that the project should go 'on site' in February of this year.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The Association and myself, personally, are both extremely grateful to you for your intervention in the above matter". I wish to pay tribute to its work, which is extremely valuable.</p></blockquote>
The honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire has raised a point which goes to the heart of the wider urban regeneration role that Scottish Homes will play in housing areas. The honourable Member for East Lothian also raised a relevant matter in relation to the need for a co-ordinated and integrated approach. The Government's policy on this matter is set out in paragraph 2.11 of the White Paper. Scottish Homes is not intended to displace the Scottish Development Agency as the proper source of expertise and action and the channel for Government funding for urban regeneration work, which is primarily related to economic development. There is absolutely no desire to lose the SDA's valuable contribution. My honourable Friend the Minister for State is responsible for the SDA and keeps in the closest touch with its activities in that connection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right that Scottish Homes should be able to embrace action in relation to employment-related problems within urban regeneration projects primarily related to housing. One of the root causes of the problems of large housing estates has been the tendency to treat them simply as collections of houses rather than as communities, for which housing problems are intertwined with other difficulties. Scottish Homes must be able to contribute to a broadly-based strategy for dealing with the full range of problems. In doing so, it is desirable that it should not have to draw in other agencies more than is necessary. There is a balance to be struck between the merits of partnership, particularly with the local authority, and the need to avoid cumbersome liaison arrangements between too large a number of bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Within the present drafting of the Bill, Scottish Homes' ability to deal with employment-related problems is intended to be embraced by the reference in clause 1(3)(f) to the "social environment".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>138</span>
However, I recognise that there is a case for more explicit wording to make clearer the existing policy behind the Bill. I am therefore glad to accept the honourable Gentleman's amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. I hope that that sets a precedent, but I fear that it is unlikely. I was heartened by what he said by way of preface to his acceptance of the amendment. Opposition Members will all be grateful for that. All we need now is the money to back it up. I express my gratitude to the Minister and hope that his acceptance of the amendment is a sign of things to come.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>139</span>
He has not shut the door on himself yet, and if he is in good fettle today, who knows, we may make further headway this morning. Let us hope so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The objective of the set of amendments—the Minister can take his pick—is to make statutory provision for national surveys of the conditions of housing in Scotland, based on research carried out regularly by local authorities with funds from and within a framework set by Scottish Homes. It is an important issue. Anyone who is concerned about housing in Scotland has been talking about the need for a house condition survey and a housing needs survey in Scotland for a long time. The debate will give us an opportunity to press the Government and to find out whether they are genuinely seeking to establish a framework for better management for housing in Scotland in the future or whether they intend to muddle on and to continue to confuse the issue by working on the basis of misleading statistics and trying to gloss over the housing crisis that certainly exists in Scotland. We have a Bill that is based on Conservative party dogma and bears very little relationship to the actual needs for change in housing in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But we recognise—and that is the spirit on which we move the amendment—that Scottish Homes could be the sort of co-ordinating body to carry out the work that needs to be done to establish in detail the position of housing in various parts of Scotland, and on the basis of that survey Scottish Homes could target the resources available and ensure that the real areas of need were dealt with according to priority and not prejudice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It must be said that the house condition survey should have been set up along ago. It is now imperative that a housing needs survey and house condition survey should be undertaken to provide the basis for the strategy and investment plans for Scottish Homes in different parts of Scotland in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn) rightly dwelt at the last sitting on the difficulties caused by inappropriate and bad planning of housing developments in the past. Decisions had been taken at every level that the way to solve the housing crisis was to flatten large areas of our city centres and to build vast numbers of housing units on the peripheries of our cities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments seek to ensure that similar mistakes are not made again, that major decisions for investment and for planning housing in future are based on accurate information and proper public debate of the alternatives, not simply on a political decision taken by someone who wants to make his reputation for building umpteen million houses—sorry, thousands of houses; I must not exaggerate. We need a proper assessment of the real needs and circumstances and a proper public debate about how best to deal with the problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the build-up to the Bill, the Government statements issued over the months were littered with slogans about quality and choice of housing. We are
	<span class='label label-info column'>140</span>
all in favour of improving the quality of housing in Scotland and the choice available for tenants and householders. The trouble is that the slogans do not square with facts. The White Paper and the consultation document that led up to the Bill were full of many frankly complacent references to the state of housing in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government quote official statistics showing that there has been a dramatic drop in the number of dwellings below the tolerable standard in Scotland, down to 56,516 such houses in 1986. If that were true, I am sure that we should all welcome it. However, I am afraid that the statistics are debatable and that there are still far too many homes below the tolerable standard in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall talk presently about the survey that has been carried out by Glasgow district council. It is interesting to relate at this stage that that survey established that there were probably as many as 44,500 houses below the tolerable standard in Glasgow alone. If the Government are under the happy illusion that there are only 56,500 houses below the tolerable standard in the whole of Scotland, it follows that there are only 12,000 such houses outside Glasgow. That simply does not make sense and is an illustration of the inaccuracy of the statistics that the Government are using.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Fairbairn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Perth and Kinross)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the terrible contributions to the low standards of housing, not only in Glasgow but in other cities, is the Socialist Rent Acts, which prevented landlords from ever being able to afford to do up buildings properly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the honourable and learned Gentleman and his honourable Friends will argue that, by giving landlords the freedom to charge ever higher rents, they will start to produce better-quality housing for people to rent. I find that a little far fetched, and the evidence is that it does not happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can give the honourable and Gentlemen some of the evidence. In Edinburgh, for instance, where it was necessary for the district council to intervene when landlords were not restricted by the so-called Socialist Rent Acts, but in fact were raking it in from Conservative—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We must stick to the terms of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My honourable Friend will be able to make his own contribution to this debate in due course. I have no doubt that, with his wide experience of the management of housing in the city of Edinburgh, as the convenor of the housing committee of Edinburgh city district council, he may well be able to tell us quite a bit bout these circumstances, because Edinburgh is a city with a substantial amount of privately-owned rented accommodation, which includes some probably rather poor stuff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the spirit of this debate will be such as
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0157">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>141</span>
to enable the Committee to achieve a consensus on the need to obtain accurate information on the state of housing in Scotland, so that we can plan for the future and target sufficient resources to deal with these problems. It would be a pity if we became involved in a slanging match, although it is always a pleasure to be drawn into arguments with the honourable and learned Member for Perth and Kinross. This is a fundamental issue on which we seriously hope for a positive response from the Minister. We shall go on until we get one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was speaking of homes below the tolerable standard. That does not cover all the bad housing in Scotland. The official category "below the tolerable standard" does not include a whole range of relatively serious defects, such as poor insulation, condensation, lack of central heating and other problems. To take another example, the 1981 Census suggested that there were 23,400 houses in Scotland without indoor WCs. That was in the Census return, and presumably those are the figures the Government are working on, but local authority returns suggest that there may be as many as 70,000 such houses in Scotland. There is a large discrepancy between 23,400 and 70,000. Again, that illustrates the need for proper information about the quality of housing in Scotland and the need for a co-ordinated local survey of housing conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The necessity for a survey of housing needs is also part of the group of amendments, although it was also debated in the Committee's last sitting. It is important to have proper information about housing needs to plan for future housing construction and improvement budgeting. We know that about 31,000 people become homeless every year in Scotland, and that there are waiting lists of 200,000 for houses in local authority areas. We know that one and a quarter million people in Scotland are living in overcrowded conditions, which is 14 per cent. of households, compared with only 3.4 per cent. in England and 2.8 per cent. in Wales. That illustrates an alarming aspect of housing in Scotland. It also highlights the mismatch between available housing and the people applying for housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We keep hearing Government spokesmen citing the crude statistics that there are more empty houses in Scotland than homeless people, but I wish they would tell us where those empty houses are and what condition they are in. I could cite examples from my own constituency of people who are homeless, or facing the prospect of homelessness, and who are prepared to accept private rented accommodation in the most appalling condition. For example, a young family came to see me at my surgery last autumn who were living in a farm cottage. It did not have proper heating, it was damp, it had rats going about it and the floorboards were caving in. They were paying far too high a rent for it, but it was better than not having a roof over their heads. A substantial number of these houses which are listed as empty in Scotland are not fit for habitation. We need an accurate comparison between what is available and what is required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Returning to the case for a house conditions survey, we have heard quotations from the excellent
	<span class='label label-info column'>142</span>
Professor Duncan Maclennan. I now quote from what he said to the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations conference in 1987:
	<br><blockquote><p>"What we really require is for more authorities to follow the example of Glasgow District Council and undertake detailed social surveys in conjunction with condition surveys. I also believe, for reasons set out further below that condition surveys have to be accompanied with a survey of how effective social landlords are in meeting the needs and demands of their consumers. A condition survey may tell us how much investment is required, a social survey may help inform us of how the burden of upgrading is to be split between residents and the state, but the management effectiveness survey is critical to an understanding of the agencies which should be used to regenerate the condition of the stock."</p></blockquote>
That is one of the fine experts in housing in Scotland, who knows his subject. He gives clear recommendations that there should be a proper scientific survey, so that we know the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Scottish Homes it to approach its task properly in the coming year, it will need accurate information to develop a strategy for development work and for investment, and so be able to target its resources accurately, according to need and not according to the whims of Ministers or anybody else. The demands for a house condition survey come from every quarter. Anybody concerned about housing in Scotland recognises the need for more accurate information. Local authorities are asking for house condition surveys; so is Shelter and anybody concerned about the Scottish housing crisis. At present, it is far too difficult to quantify the extent of the problems which our people face. Shelter has estimated that as many as a quarter of a million municipal houses alone need full modernisation, and another quarter of a million need treatment for dampness and condensation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Should Scottish Homes attempt to enter on its activities based on the official statistics for housing needs and conditions, such as they are, ample evidence is available to suggest that its efforts will be misdirected. It will be working on false information, and could make serious mistakes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take one example. Official Government statistics for 1986, to which I have already referred, show that there were 56,516 houses below the tolerable standard in Scotland. Of those, 11,452 were concentrated in Glasgow. Those statistics come from reports on housing by district councils to the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To identify the terms used, the term "below tolerable standard" includes a number of categories: first, housing which is not structurally sound; secondly, housing which is not substantially free from penetrating damp; thirdly, housing which does not have a wholesome supply of running water; fourthly, lack of adequate lighting, ventilation and heating; fifthly, lack of a water closet within the hours which is for the sole use of the occupants; and finally, lack of satisfactorily food-cooking facilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, local authorities have some difficulty in identifying such property. They will only know about such houses if they are drawn to their attention. That probably accounts for the fact that the surveys from the information sent to the Scottish Office up to now have tended to be incomplete.

Let us contrast those official statistics, which are being used by the Government at present, and on which Scottish Homes will presumably have to rely in the absence of a proper house condition survey, with the Glasgow House Conditions Survey carried out by the district council in Glasgow a couple of years ago, for the same period covered by the official statistics which I have quoted. The Glasgow survey discovered that there were approximately 44,500 houses below the tolerable standard in Glasgow alone. That figure is clearly more accurate than the official statistics used by the Government, which cited about 11,000 in Glasgow. That demonstrates that the offical statistics for homes below the tolerable standard in Glasgow were inaccurate by 378 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one multiplies that over the whole of Scotland, one finds that, instead of 56,500 homes below the tolerable standard in Scotland, as is currently thought by the Government officially, there must be nearer 210,000. That may not be a fair comparison. The inaccuracy of the Glasgow statistics may be either worse of better than statistics for other parts of Scotland; but Glasgow is by far the largest housing authority in Scotland, and the statistics found there as a result of detailed analysis in the Glasgow House Condition Survey demonstrate dramatically how far adrift of present official Government statistics are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now refer to the details of the Glasgow House Condition Survey, aspects of which ought to be considered by the Committee and the Minister. The "Summary of Key Findings" starts with the heading "Unsatisfactory Dwellings", and reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Some 33 per cent. of occupied dwellings in Glasgow—97,400 dwellings—were found to be unsatisfactory in some important way, either by failing the Tolerable Standard, lacking standard amenities such as a bath or wash-hand basin or requiring costing more than £5,000. On all three of these indicators, the private rented sector had the highest proportion of unsatisfactory houses, followed by the owner-occupied sector. The SSHA had the lowest proportion of unsatisfactory houses on all three indicators."</p></blockquote>
The Survey goes into some detail on the subject of "The Tolerable Standard":
	<br><blockquote><p>"The total number of dwellings below the Tolerable Standard in Glasgow (occupied plus vacant) is estimated to be 44,500. This is 15 per cent. of the city's stock. Almost all of these dwellings—42,100—were occupied. Nearly half of the properties failing the Tolerable Standard failed because of rising or penetrating damp. BTS (Below Tolerable Standard) 'dampness' affects 20,000 occupied dwellings in Glasgow. Condensation, no matter how severe, is not a reason for failure on the Tolerable Standard. Some 55,400 dwellings were found which suffered from condensation…BTS conditions were found in the public sector as well as the private sector. Nearly one in eight of all District Council houses were found BTS (21,200 dwellings) compared with one in three privately rented houses and one in six owner-occupied houses. Statistics from the Department of Environmental Health had indicated that in March 1985 there were 12,189 private sector dwellings below the Tolerable Standard. The survey now shows that there are 19,900 occupied BTS private sector dwellings in Glasgow—some 7,700 more than previously estimated. The total number of occupied dwellings considered BTS would be increased by 700 if the Tolerable Standard were revised in order to fail dwellings which did not have a bath or shower. This revisions has been proposed by the Scottish Office in the Green Paper 'Home Improvement in Scotland—A New Approach'. The survey found 1,300 private sector dwellings with a rateable value above grant aid limits which were considered to be below the Tolerable Standard."</p></blockquote>
The local authority, therefore, would not be in a
	<span class='label label-info column'>144</span>
position to help with those dwellings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make no apology for refering to the survey. On the subject of standard amenities, it continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is currently estimated that 6,400 dwellings in Glasgow (occupied plus vacant) lack one or more standard amenities such as a bath or wash-hand basin. This is 2 per cent. of the city's stock."</p></blockquote>
The survey goes on to discuss the costs of repairing the housing stock, and says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Repair costs were calculated as 'repair only'—that is—to give each element in disrepair a life of 30 years. This does not include any element of improvement to the dwelling. On this basis the total repair bill for Glasgow was estimated to £1,301 million. The bill for Glasgow District Council's own stock is £602 million, and that for the private sector is £639 million…</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"The survey found that 79,700 dwellings need repairs costing over £5,000 per dwelling; half of these are owned by Glasgow District Council. Some 31,100 dwellings were identified which need repairs costing over £10,000; only a quarter of these are owned by Glasgow District Council. The really expensive repairs are found in the private sector."</p></blockquote>
I shall soon conclude on this survey, Mr. Martin, but with your own constituency interests in the Springburn area, you and indeed all Members of the Committee will recognise that these are disturbing and alarming facts and figures on housing in the city of Glasgow. They demonstrate the shortcoming of official statistics, and the need for more accurate information for future planning. It is worth getting this information on the record, and I hope that the Minister will respond to it in due course. The last two subjects in the survey to which I shall refer are essential repairs and the problems of central heating and electrical wiring. On essential repairs the survey says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Essential repairs are those 'medium' or 'major' repairs needed to make a dwelling wind and watertight, to overcome certain structural defects and to forestall further rapid deterioration of the dwelling. Approximately 111,700 occupied dwellings were found to require one or more essential repairs. This represents 39 per cent. of occupied dwellings in the city. The essential repairs most frequently identified are to doors, windows or panels. These are required to 71,500 occupied houses—25 per cent. of the city's occupied stock. Essential roof repairs are needed by 60,700 occupied dwellings—21 per cent. of occupied dwellings in the city."</p></blockquote>
Finally, on the subject of central heating and electrical wiring, the report says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Some 45,000 dwellings in Glasgow (16 per cent. of the occupied stock) were found to have obsolete electrical installation. These were most common in the private rented sector with 37 per cent. of dwellings effected."</p></blockquote>
I pay tribute to Glasgow district council for conducting that detailed survey. A great deal of effort and cost has been involved in compiling that survey of the conditions of housing in Glasgow, and it will help Glasgow district council to plan for the future. We suggest that there is a need for a similar survey to be extended throughout the nation of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish briefly to broaden the debate to the case for a social survey in relation to housing needs and conditions. A draft of a social survey in Glasgow, published in November 1987 by Professor Duncan Maclennan and others, attempted to assess the levels of satisfaction with housing of residents. The survey stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the council sector young households, often with families, are predominant in the least well regarded areas and where few houses have gardens."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0159">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>145</span>
It concluded that the observed age-demographic patterns had strong implications for policy, and said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the short term the increasingly higher average age of the population is likely to increase the problems associated with managing repair programmes. Allocation and rent policies should take account of the Age/Amenity mismatches observed in the study. In the longer term the predominance of the elderly in the social rented sector indicates that in the next decade the relet and availability rate in all the social sectors may rise sharply. We would recommend that Glasgow District Council should quantify this issue further prior to formulating future strategies for their stock."</p></blockquote>
There is a limit to the number of ways of approaching this subject. It should be self-evident that there is an urgent need for accurate information in order to base housing planning and housing investment strategy. I put on record my gratitude to Shelter, to Glasgow district council, and specifically to the Convention of Scottish Local Associations in general for the information that they have made availabe to Members of the Committee so that this alarming situation can be discussed. Against that background we find it extraordinary that the Government have refused to co-ordinate and fund a house condition survey in Scotland, unless they are trying to conceal the real facts in order to justify some of the more irrelevant aspects of their policy in general and the Bill in particular.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 23rd October 1987 I asked the Minister in a Written Question if he would commission a comprehensive national house condition survey in Scotland. His reply was:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I have no immediate plans to do so but am considering representations from the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and others on this subject at the present time.—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 29 October 1987; Vol. 121, c.	<i>431.</i>]</p></blockquote>
Since then we have had a White Paper, which made no reference to a house condition survey. Now we have a Bill which makes no reference to a house condition or housing needs survey. Therefore, the Minister should not be surprised that he is coming under some pressure to conduct such a survey to enable local authorities to do their job properly and to lay down a statutory framework which would enable Scottish Homes to put together and fund such a survey.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has said nothing further, in the consultation paper, the White Paper or the Bill, but if he has a serious interest in tackling some of the more shocking aspects of Scotland's housing crisis, he should take the opportunity of this debate to announce that the Government will require Scottish Homes to fund a co-ordinated, comprehensive survey to be carried out by local authorities in Scotland, in order to identify the priorities for future housing planning and investment and to form the basis for action and budgeting by the Scottish Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I acknowledge that the Scottish Development Department has taken a timid step in the right direction by promoting a format for local surveys, but we need more than that. The time has come to establish a co-ordinated Scottish national house condition and needs survey to form the basis of a national house planning policy. The Labour party is committed to supporting such a survey, at both local and national level. There already are house condition
	<span class='label label-info column'>146</span>
surveys in England and in Wales, funded by central Government. Why on earth can we not have similar surveys in Scotland to provide the basis for future action?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is usually more advantageous to speak after the Minister, because he usually gives one something to speak about. In fact, I have a great deal to say on the amendment, without worrying about what the Minister might say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was struck by the reference to the condition of housing in Scotland in paragraph 1.16 of the White Paper, which says that it is the Government's view that the condition of the housing stock in Scotland
	<br><blockquote><p>"must be seen in perspective.</p></blockquote>
That is a strange phrase to use. It is difficult for a family to understand it if they are living in a house with a bathroom and kitchen whose walls are running with water to the extent that the water gets into the wardrobe and the clothes, covers them with fungus so that the clothes and furniture have to be thrown out, and the district council says that, because of lack of money, nothing can be done about it. The local councillor will not be listened to. He goes along to those people and says "But the Minister and the Government tell you that you must see these housing conditions in perspective". It does not make any sense. It is not only complacent. It is excessively arrogant for any Government to argue along those lines in a Scottish housing White Paper, which has reputedly been drafted to look at the problems in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The paragraph goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There have been enormous improvements in housing conditions during this century."</p></blockquote>
It would be strange if there had not been improvements during this century. The paragraph says that space per person and basic amenities are much better now than they were back in the 1890s. Indeed. Again we see the Government's attitude to serious problems. They seem to be telling the people of Scotland who are living in inadequate housing conditions that they should think themselves lucky, because they are better off than their grandparents. Of course they are better off than their grandparents were; they are better off than the cavemen were thousands of years ago. But we are speaking about the present, and it is the Government's failure to tackle the problems in the present which underlines the real need to set up a house condition survey.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government admit that there are poor housing conditions in Scotland. In paragraph 1.11 they say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Poor housing conditions…are the result of bad management"—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"as well as insensitive or misconceived design."</p></blockquote>
No one will argue that the housing designs of the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s are good; they were often very poor. Whole blocks of flats designed and built in the 1960s have since been demolished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0160">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>147</span>
I was interested to hear the Minister concede to the honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) that Scottish Homes will be able to put money into improving the economic situation in housing areas. In Glasgow there was a great deal of argument over the future of the Hutchison town E flats, which were built in the 1960s: should they be demolished or should there be an attempt to bring them back into a habitable state? One of the plans that was brought forward suggested that the density and structure of the housing be changed and a great deal of money spent, shops opened up and economic life brought brought back into that area to cure the vandalism and so on. That was a good idea, which the Government seem to be endorsing this morning; yet the money was never made available. In the end, only 15 years ago the whole block of flats had to be demolished. That is an important issue. It is not only simply a matter of agreeing a theory but of putting up the money, and too often the Government have failed to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government go on to say in the White Paper that another reason for the poor housing conditions in Scotland is that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Low rents in many areas have contributed to inadequate standards of management and repair, against tenants' long term interests."</p></blockquote>
That point was also made by the honourable and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn). That issue must be disputed during this debate. As the Minister will know, district councils, for example, pay for maintenance and repair for their houses through the housing revenue account, which was traditionally made up of three elements: one was certainly rents, but the other two were housing support grant and rate fund—contribution. The last two were the contribution from the ratepayer and the taxpayer to the housing costs of people in the public sector, the same way as mortgage tax relief is a contribution from the tax payer to owner-occupiers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whereas the Government have been keen to maintain that taxpayers' subsidy to owner-occupiers to the extent of £4,500 million this year, mainly in the south-east of England, as my honourable Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) keeps pointing out, they have slashed the housing support grant contribution to housing revenue accounts. Dundee used to get £8 million in housing support grant from the Government, but it gets nothing today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have also slashed rate fund contributions, with the inevitable effect of pushing the rents up. The council in Dundee is under pressure, not because its rents are too low but because they are too high. That makes it almost impossible for it to provide the repair and maintenance service necessary to keep its housing stock in good condition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Among those who know best about the state of Scotland's housing and whether there should be a house condition survey is COSLA. Along with other Scottish Members on the Committee—I assume that English Members on the Committee did not receive it—I received a letter from COSLA dated 12 June 1987, the day after the general election. It says that it is writing as a matter of urgency to Members of
	<span class='label label-info column'>148</span>
Parliament to make clear the extent of the housing crisis in Scotland, and to provide its Scottish Housing Manifesto, which was set up to tackle dampness and condensation. Every member of the Committee who has been to Scotland—I known that some may never have been to Scotland; the honourable Member for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Arbuthnot) may be one—and who has visited council housing and SSHA housing will know how serious the problem of dampness and condensation is, particularly in windows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been in houses which still have the metal-frame windows put in the 1940s and 1950s in Dundee, but because of lack of money the council cannot replace them. They are the real source of dampness and condensation; the windows stream with water, which goes on to the window-sill and runs down on to the walls. The wallpaper peels off. That is the condition people are living in. The only solution is a programme of window replacement. In Dundee about 20,000 windows need to be replaced now which, because the Government cuts in district council support, will have to wait 10, 15, 20 or even 25 years. Window replacement and comprehensive heating packages, sometimes at a cost of £16,000 or £17,000 a house, are the measures that must be taken if the condition of the housing stock in Scotland is ever to be improved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
COSLA's housing manifesto says that the first and immediate step that needs to be taken is the establishment of a Scottish house condition survey. That appears on almost the first page of its manifesto. It says that the field work for such a survey should be carried out within the first 12 months and that thereafter there should be five-yearly surveys to monitor the progress in improving the housing stock and bring to light any problems so that they can be dealt with speedily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been in correspondence with the Minister about one of my constituents who used to live in an SSHA house which he bought some years ago. At the time the association did not realise that there was anything wrong with the house, and the tenant did not realise there was anything wrong with it when he bought it. But after buying it he discovered that there were serious problems with the steel panels, the basic element in the construction of the house, and that the repair costs would be very heavy. That man will receive no compensation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister says, he was the man who was buying the house and he should have known that there were problems with the steel panels, yet the SSHA has written to me saying that it did not know about them. If a house condition survey had been in place at that time, the SSHA might have known about the problems in those houses and been able to warn any potential buyer about them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
COSLA is asking not simply for a house condition survey but that is should be linked to a review of the existing building regulations in consultation with the local authorities. For example, it says that there should be a review of space standards. I see that in the White Paper the Government claim
	<br><blockquote><p>"The amount of space per person has also increased steadily and is now among the highest in Europe."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0161">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>149</span>
Yet, as my honourable Friend the Member for East Lothian, said, 1¼ million Scots are living in overcrowded conditions. Therefore, something must be done about that as soon as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
COSLA also wants the review to consider heating, insulation and service standards. It believes that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The House Condition Survey will be the single most important measure of the amount of work which is still needed to be done."</p></blockquote>
It says that the houses in such a survey should be marked against several different standards. For example, it suggests that there should be a revised tolerable standard. My honourable Friend the Member for East Lothian said that the existing tolerable standards lay down that houses should be structurally sound and substantially free from damp. That is an important difference, because COSLA is arguing that its revised tolerable standard should include "substantial freedom from condensation". If a tenant goes to a district council whose hands are tied behind its back and which does not have the money to deal with dampness and condensation and says "I've got a damp house. The walls are running with water", it will more often than not make the excuse "Ah, but it's condensation, not damp. You can't expect us to do anything about it."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is still wet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my honourable Friend says, it is still wet. The tenant cannot see any difference between dampness and condensation, because both mean that he has to live in misery. Therefore, it is important that the tolerable standard is revised, to take account not only of dampness but of condensation too, because they are prevalent throughout the housing stock in Scotland. That fact must be put on the record, and the Government must accept it. Once they accept it, they must follow it up and accept extra responsibilities for helping district councils to tackle the problem, in particular by releasing money to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, COSLA's revised tolerable standard
	<br><blockquote><p>"will be updated to include substantial freedom from condensation; and the provision of a fixed bath/shower and wash-hand basin, both with a supply of hot and cold water".</p></blockquote>
As I understand it, at present there must only by a supply of cold water; hot water is not a necessity under the present tolerable standard. That is a disgrace in this day and age. Perhaps the honourable and learned Member for Perth and Kinross has no need for hot water, but everyone else in Scotland would welcome access to hot water inside the house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As well as the revised tolerable standard, COSLA suggests that the houses surveyed in the house condition survey should be marked against a renovation standard which would include disrepair. It says that this new renovation standard
	<br><blockquote><p>"should be met when houses are renovated. This will require that a house should:
	<ol>
	<li>meet the revised tolerable standard;</li>
	<li>be in a good state of repair;</li>
	<li>have a potential future life of 30 years;</li>
	<li>to be free from lead water tanks and pipes. (This condition may be imposed at the discretion of the local authority)".</li></ol></p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>150</span>
That does not exist at the moment. I do not think that any member of the Committee would suggest that they should not. Those are matters that a house condition survey should look at and bring to light to enable the Government, in consultation with the local authorities and the new agency, Scottish Homes, to start a programme of work which ensures that all houses are eventually dealt with in this way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third standard which COSLA recommends is an insulation standard. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Existing standards of insulation are not adequate for the cold Scottish climate."</p></blockquote>
Anyone who has been in Scotland will agree with that. I do not know whether the honourable Member for Wanstead and Woodford has ever been in Scotland, but he may go up there for grouse shooting sometimes. Anyone who goes up at this time of the year will find that it is much colder than in Kensington and Chelsea and that a much higher standard of insultation is needed up there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
COSLA goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Consultation with all interested organisations will therefore be undertaken in order to agree a new higher standard. As an interim measure, a higher standard of loft insulation will be applied to all new buildings and loft insulation grants immediately."</p></blockquote>
That is the kind of programme that we should embark on—a house condition survey linked to a review of the building regulations in consultation with the local authorities and to these three new standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An insulation standard is perhaps as important as any. As the Minister should know, the elderly in Scotland, particularly at this time of year, are a severe risk. I have tabled questions to the Government about the number of people who are likely to die from hypothermia in any given year and they said the about 66 people had died from hypothermia in Dundee over the past six or seven years. But that figure grossly underestimates the real situation. The charitable organisations that work with the elderly estimate that in the United Kingdom 80,000 people die every year from hypothermia or related causes. Age Concern sent us a document which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Studies have found that many old people live in conditions well below 16 degrees Centigrade; the minimum temperature specified in the Offices, Shops and Railways Act 1963."</p></blockquote>
It points out that way back in 1972 the DHSS recommended, in a leaflet called "Keeping Warm in Winter", that a living-room temperature of 70 degrees Farenheit, which is 21 degrees Centigrade, was necessary to keep old people warm. Yet today many old people live in conditions well below 16 degrees Centigrade, substantially lower than the DHSS recommendation in 1972.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Age Concern points out:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government withdrew its recommendation shortly after evidence from a National Survey showed that virtually no old people enjoyed this level of comfort."</p></blockquote>
Virtually no elderly people were living in housing conditions of 21 degrees Centigrade. Age Concern says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Later the Department's sensitivity on the issue was revealed when a memo written by a senior official in 1976 was leaked urging that information given to Parliament be restricted, which read:—</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0162">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>151</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>'It is of great importance not to issue information which may be misleading which could certainly be used against the government", and continued:—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>'It is almost certain that any reply which suggested that large numbers of old people might be suffering from hypothermia might be used to bring pressure on the government to improve heating provision for old people in some way."</p></blockquote>
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Irrespective of what Government were in power at the time or the officials who issued such memos, that recommendation in 1972 is still valid today in 1988. Old people should be living at room tempratures of 21 degrees Centigrade. They are not. They are living at temperatures well below 16 degrees Centigrade, and that is one of the main contributing factors to the thousands of deaths of old people in this country every winter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A house condition survey could make a contribution towards ending that scandalous state of affairs. It is not a question of blaming Tory or Labour Governments; it is a question of the people here in this Room bowing to the facts, which are that there is a housing crisis in Scotland. There is terrible dampness, condensation, overcrowding and inadequate standards, and one way to begin to tackle that is to have a house condition survey and to set new standards. That should be linked to the Government's intention to provide money through Scottish Homes, local authorities and every type of housing agency to ensure that we tackle the serious problem and begin to improve the situation. We must not be complacent and sit back saying that things are better now than they were last century. We want them much better than they are now. Let us look forward instead of back. I hope that the Minister will respond to my honourable Friend the Member for East Lothian by saying that he agrees to a house condition survey.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 57 deals with the addition of four subsections to clause 1, but I shall restrict my remarks this morning to the first and last of the four suggested additions because they support the main thrust of the argument that has already been made by the honourable Members for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) and for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion), namely, the question of a housing condition survey and the housing needs of various areas in Scotland. The other items in the amendment concerning homelessness and special needs housing can be dealt with more appropriately in another debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since I was elected in 1983 I, like other honourable Members, have used every opportunity to try to persuade the Government of the day to consider that question. I have had a Ten-minute Bill and an Adjournment debate in the course of the past four years. Housing stock in Scotland is very much in need of assessment and survey. My own realisation that something required to be done did not come perhaps from the same kind of experience as that described earlier by the honourable Members for East Lothian and for Dundee, East because their constituencies are more urban. But many
	<span class='label label-info column'>152</span>
Conservative Members come from constituencies that are similar to mine, and the problem is not restricted just to an urban context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, the quantity and extent of the problem is greater simply because of the number of housing units to be found cheek by jowl in high-density housing areas, but in rural areas, there are also great problems arising from the condition of housing stock. Indeed, the problem is made even worse because some of the local authorities, which are doing their best to maintain the housing stock, have considerable difficulties because of the disparate nature of the communities, the ribbon nature of the development undertaken in Victorian days, which obviously and sensibly at that stage related to farm developments. Hamlets and small settlements were built up round farms. The needs of the farming industry in those days are now long since past and many of those communities have disintegrated because of the inexorable depopulation of the past 50 years or so. Local authorities such as Berwickshire have a great problem knowing what to do with that housing stock. The majority of it is still in private hands, which makes it even more difficult to tackle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should look carefully at the scheme introduced by his Government in 1983 for home improvement grants. The two local authorities in my constituency made very good use of the 80 or 90 per cent. improvement grants available at that time for improving housing stock. I was sorry that that scheme was withdrawn so summarily, although I can understand that unexpected demands may have been made upon it. Indeed, the very fact that it was withdrawn so summarily suggested that the Scottish Office had no idea to what use that scheme would be put because it did not know the state of the housing stock. Otherwise it must have realised exactly to what use it would be put.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The way in which that scheme was operated and withdrawn provides that cogent argument that the Government themselves did not know to what properties it could be applied and to what extent it could assist. If there was ever an eloquent argument for a house condition survey, the history of that scheme and the way in which it had to be withdrawn so quickly proves that the Government did not know what they were taking on.

Although the argument about a housing condition survey predominantly rotates around the needs of urban areas, I do counsel the Government to look carefully at the needs of rural areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to pick a fight with the honourable Gentleman since he is my Member for Parliament, but I do not accept that this a predominantly urban problem. Clearly, it is a serious problem in urban areas, but he knows as well as I do that there are serious problems of substandard housing, principally in the private sector, in rural Scotland. He knows that from his experiences in his constituency, as I do from mine. I am inclined to invite him to East Lothian to see the excellent work that is being done by East Lothian district council in trying to cajole the owners of vacant farm

cottages to improve and upgrade that property and to let it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let no one say that I do not listen to the "listening party". I am suitably admonished. I was trying to support the arguments that were so eloquently made. I am a Glaswegian myself: I was born in Easterhouse, and if I get the chance I shall regale the Committee about my own experiences. I see the Chairman's eyes on me. The honourable Member for East Kilbride (Mr. Ingram) and I spent the best part of our mispent youth in the shadows of Easterhouse in a slightly classier place called Cranhill, which I am sure you know, Mr. Martin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the honourable Member for East Lothian reinforces my point that a balance must be kept and that we must not lose sight of the needs of the rural areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to dwell for a moment on the first paragraph of the amendment. It relates to what I have been saying about rural areas. The needs of each area are specifically free standing—important in themselves and by themselves. Although a housing condition survey undertaken nationally would statistically measure the needs against a proper statistical background with questions asked, that is common across the country. I think that the various regions within the national context could sensibly, with merit and good cause, be looked at individually in terms of the breakdown and special conditions that apply within regions. That would not necessarily flow from a national housing condition survey, the like of which is undertaken currently in England on a five-year basis. Knowing the housing needs of a region or area would help Scottish Homes to decide what to do, and it would make more sense to collect statistical evidence on a regional or area basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main thrust of the matters that I want to insinuate into the Minister's head is this: First, I shall not be convinced that the Government are not running away from this problem until they accept the need for a survey. I do not always believe in the theory of conspiracy and I am not a naturally suspicious chap. But if the Government use arguments about cost statistical veracity or difficulty in order to run away and hide from the question, they will be faced with the question, even if they are frightened of the answer. That is something that will be in many people's minds. When one watches "Yes, Minister" and "Yes, Prime Minister", one does not need too much imagination to visualise the Minister or Prime Minister of the day being told that the last thing that he wants to set in train is a statistical survey of the condition and state of housing stock in Scotland, because he would not be able to publish the answer since it would be so detrimental to his Government and Governments of other political complexions in the past. The Govnernment must face up to that squarely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have heard nothing to convince me that the reasons advanced for not having a house condition survey measure up, make sense or hold water. The Government will be dogged by that question until they face up squarely to the need for such a survey.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>154</span>
Of course I recognise the question of cost, and I am prepared to argue and discuss the cost. With good will there must be methods of minimising that cost, whether by stretching it over a longer rolling period than five years, by taking other statistical devices and measures, or perhaps even having a slightly more cursory survey. I am prepared to consider and think about them all. There must be ways of limiting the cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have heard the figure £8 million bandied about. That is not an insignificant sum, but even if it did cost £8 million over a period, the benefits for middle and long-term planning and strategy would more than repay the costs involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a matter for argument. The Minister knows exactly what he is facing, what such surveys will cost and whether there are ways of minimising the cost. I am not privy to that information, but he should address his mind to it and tell us whether cheaper alternatives have been investigated to try to tackle the problem of cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I am tabling amendments this morning to pin responsibility for a house condition survey on Scottish Homes, I do not believe that that is ideal. A central survey would be ideal. The Scottish Office has the expertise and it has access to all the books of local authorities. It can ask questions and it can ask further questions of local authorities and housing departments. It will have a unique relationship with Scottish Homes. It is in a prime position to take an overview, to draw all the information together and to publish the results in the most meaningful form. Any amendment that sought to put the duty on Scottish Homes, as these amendments do, is very much a second best. But it could be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government set their face against doing a survey themselves and are prepared to allow Scottish Homes do it, it could do it area by area, or even piecemeal, starting in areas where housing associations and other bodies that it is funding are working, taking a broad overview of small localities, even going down to streets or groups of streets to build up a complete picture. In that way, over a period of time the information would be built up and fed to the Scottish Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of housing is bedevilled by the fact that we are all arguing on the basis of hearsay evidence, our own experience, or on the basis of the excellent work done by Shelter, the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations and other bodies. But we are hampered by the fact that, unlike our peer groups and organisations in England and Wales, we do not have the raw statistics to enable us to make judgments. My judgment about what is necessary might substantially change if I were presented with the results of a house condition survey. For example, the balance of my argument with the honourable Member for East Lothian—whether more priorty should be given to rural areas than to urban areas—may change as a result of a house condition survey. It is as fundamental as that. It would have a significant effect
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0164">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>155</span>
on the priorities and plans of any Government, agency or local authority if they had a systematic, statistical pool of information on which to draw.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If our request is refused and Scottish Homes comes into being without the advantage of a house condition survey, its work will be terribly trammelled and hampered. I am sure that Scottish Homes would also take that view. What puzzles me more than anything else is that the Government, properly, are making much of the fact that there is a parallel between Scottish Homes in housing and the Scottish Development Agency in the industrial and economic field. One of the SDA's most valuable roles is its ability to bring in consultants and look quickly at the economic and social factors involved in legal and regional problems. It has no difficulty in obtaining statistics and background information to enable it to take sensible decisions. It does that very well. It is always bringing in consultants—who are paid fancy fees. I sometimes wonder whether, if the SDA knocked on a few doors and asked a few simple questions, it might not get the same answers. But that is a separate argument. The equivalent to that consultancy-based approach, adopted with some success by the SDA, would be to start in each locality with the raw statistics about the condition of the housing stock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government will be tying one hand of Scottish Homes behind its back if they do not seriously consider at some stage and financed somehow, a house condition survey in Scotland. It is very important and I hope that the Minister will respond positively to this group of amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Doran 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In our surgeries we all face the innumerable problems caused by the state of housing in Scotland today. They range the availability of housing and, particularly in the context of today's debate, the condition of housing—dampness, necessary repairs, modernisation and so on. The most recent statistical bulletin produced by the Government reveals that, of just over 2 million houses in Scotland, just under half are in the public sector. It is staggering that the Government reel back from the duty that such a problem would place on public housing authorities—the local authority and the new Scottish Homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If nothing else, those 1 million houses represent a huge investment of public funds and a huge portfolio of potential property sales. Opposition Members recognise that one of the functions of Scottish Homes will be to realise that portfolio by selling off as fast as it can as many of these houses as the public are prepared to consume. Therefore, simply from the point of view of knowing what the value of its assets is, I argue that the Government should accept this fundamental obligations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course I do not accept their philosophy, but if public assets are to be disposed of in this way, it is crucial that we determine their value as accurately as possible. The detailed suvey of the condition of housing in Scotland required by the amendment would do just that. It would allow us to see down to street level, as the honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) has just suggested,
	<span class='label label-info column'>156</span>
the value of the public holding. There is no point in taking notional or historical values based on housing cost. We all know that the value of housing has increased dramatically over the years. We need to know the value and condition of these assets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members want the amendment for another more fundmental purpose—to determine accurately the state of housing in Scotland so that the Government, together with Scottish Homes and the housing authorities, can take a more professional approach to improving the housing stock, so that the misery caused by low housing standards, dampness and so on, can be dealt with in a planned and structured way, not in the present piecemeal way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities and the Government have to plan in every other area. Every local authority has to produce or contribute to a structure plan. Every aspect of local authority services is planned and programmed—for instance how much investment will be required in educaton or in social work services. There is no reason why the same should not be done in housing, not in the present piecemeal way but in a more planned and accurate way. One can plan accurately, and prepare plans for investment only by knowing exactly the state and condition of the property. The investment for which we would argue presumes a Government incentive. We hear so much about the increase in expenditure on housing and every other service, that we hope that the Government are intent on carrying this into the area of housing repairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An essential element of a professional approach to housing, is the house condition survey. It is staggering that in the statistical bulletin which I have mentioned, the Government can give figures for new building, improvement of existing houses, the sales of public sector dwellings, but cannot tell us anything of the condition of Scottish housing. That is a defect which the Opposition want to remedy. Amendment No. 48 requires a Scottish Homes.
	<br><blockquote><p>"in conjunction with local authorities,"</p></blockquote>
to develop and fund
	<br><blockquote><p>"an agreed method of assessing housing need and housing conditions in local areas on a regular basis".</p></blockquote>
It is important to examine the detail. We need first to find the method and then fund the survey. We are not laying down how that should be done, but saying that that is an obligation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it difficult to understand how the Government fulfil the objectives set out in the White Paper and in the Bill, if they do not know more about the state of Scottish housing. Paragraph 1.1 of the White Paper states that their intentions are to
	<br><blockquote><p>"give people a wider choice of housing;</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>—improve the supply and quality of that housing;</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>—encourage greater individual responsibility for, and control over, the conditions in which people live;</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>—provide a means for dealing with residual problems of homelessness.'</p></blockquote>
Honourable Members will forgive the sceptcism which has been aimed at these objectives; but if I am gracious to the Government and Conservative Members, and accept that those are their true intentions. I repeat that I find it difficult to see how they can meet these objectives without a full
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0165">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>157</span>
knowledge of the state and condition of Scottish housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition know that a wider choice of housing for many people means simply improving the bad housing conditions in which they live. My honourable Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) spoke of his own experiences in Dundee, of the dripping walls, and of the arguments presented to tenants by local authorities and local authority housing managers. I make no political distinctions in that respect, because we all struggle with the problem. Excuses are presented that a paraffin heater is used and that that creates condensation. "It's condensation, not dampness. It's not our fault. You have to keep the windows open—pay more in heating costs." All these are things that people on low incomes cannot do. What they want is better housing, without the residual problems of dampness, and without the problems created by the rush to provide a volume of housing, without any consideration of quality. That policy, which is the policy of both parties, has left ordinary people at the bottom end of the housing market. They are the people who have no real choice, who can only get out of the house that they are in, or see the improvement of the house that they are in, through either the provision of a new house by the local authority or investment by a local authority in repairs and improvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is crucial that the house conditions survey is made, for a number of other reasons. I am concerned about the standard of housing in both the public and private sectors. If we know more about our housing stock, we can think far more about the standards that we want to apply to housing. It should be an obligation of the Government to encourage excellence in all respects. The Government should be the pacesetter, and apply standards which meet the Minister's boast made earlier about the standard, for example of space, which people in this country enjoy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I winced when the Minister said that. It was only a couple of years ago that the Government relaxed the building standard regulations to allow private developers substantially to reduce the space required to be provided in private housing. We have all come across the problems of people who have been encouraged by sophisticated advertising to buy these new, restricted size houses, and find when they want to move that they cannot sell them. Young house buyers particularly have been led into the trap by all sorts of inducements. I shall not mention specific companies, which would be unfair to them, but a number of companies in Britain today provide new houses at the lower end of the market, having taken advantage of the Government's relaxation in the building standard regulations, and have placed a number of young couples in a difficult position. When I was a solicitor I had experience of many families who could not sell, and found themselves up to their eyes in debt. They were encouraged to take on loans that they could not manage to buy houses which did not adequately house them, far less a rabbit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>158</span>
It is an appalling situation. The house condition survey will allow the Government to assess the overall standard of housing in this country, and look at the standards that they would like to impose on the building industry across the board to ensure that people get the standard of housing which they deserve. The Government should lead the way. The housing condition survey would allow them to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned the building regulations. There are a number of defects in these. I may be straying here, but a housing condition survey would pick up some of these defects, for example, the many questions which have arisen about fire protection over the Christmas period. We have seen a move by the Government on the types of foam which may be used in furnishings. The next stage should be for the Government to look at, for example, the idea of smoke detectors being applied as standard, by amendments in the building regulations, to ensure that the maximum safety level is applied as a standard throughout the country. Again, that sort of point could be picked up in a housing condition survey. It is a question of the provision of excellence. The Government should take the lead in this area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, we have a patchy situation where local government at this time of the year is waiting to see how much money the Government are prepared to allow it, to do what it needs to do with its housing stock. If finds it difficult to plan. My own authority, as I mentioned earlier, found that its housing allocation was to be cut by £1.25 million for next year. That means that the Aberdeen district council will have £1.25 million less to spend on the housing needs of that area, and on repairs or new houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to see the continuing improvement of houses, but it is difficult to see how local authorities can do that in the present circumstances, where they cannot plan effectively more than 12 months ahead. A housing condition survey, and a housing assessment, would allow them at least to build the basic structure so that they could speedily work out how to spend the money that the Government aim to provide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many reasons why the measure should be accepted by the Government. It imposes no great obligation on them. It involves some expenditure, but in relative terms of the overall housing budget or the value of the approximately 1 million houses in the public sector no great or substantial expenditure. In that respect I support the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Galloway 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Hillhead)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment. All the sound and fury from the Opposition Benches may be academic, of course. We do not know for sure whether the Minister will astound us all and agree to the amendment. We have not had the benefit this morning, as we had at our last sitting, of hearing what Conservative Members think about the issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see that the honourable Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) is being exiled to Ulan Bator or along the Corridor, certainly anywhere but here where he might rise to his feet and let the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0166">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>159</span>
Conservatives' slip show and let the people of Scotland know what they really think about housing conditions in their country. The honourable and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn) has been similarly dispatched by the Whip. We now know the importance of the English Whip who has been imposed upon the Committee. It is to chase those Scottish Members of Parliament who have anything to say about housing out of the room in case they embarrass the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those two honourable Gentlemen are the only Conservative Members other than the Minister himself who have listened to a single word of the debate this morning. All other Conservative Members have been busy with other matters. The Secretary of State has just come in from the Cabinet meeting and that is acceptable, but the others have been sitting stuffing envelopes, writing next year's Christmas cards and not listening to a single word that has been said. I wanted to repeat that because it is deeply offensive and, I believe, contemptuous of the House of Commons. I may be naive and perhaps that always goes on. But if it is only my naivety, it is a great surprise and, dare I say, a disappointment to me that in this place of democratic discussion and debate people do not listen to what others are saying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not yet heard whether the Government intend to concede anything, although I have my suspicions that a house condition survey is something that this Government will want like a hole in the head.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are different reasons on the Government Benches for wanting to resist a house condition survey. Some will not want to have one because they simply do not care about housing conditions for the majority of people in Scotland; they are doing rather nicely, thank you, living in comfortable homes themselves, and are never confronted by the problems with which many of us are confronted at our weekly surgeries and in other constituency work and correspondence from constituents living in truly appalling conditions. Some do not care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are a few Conservative Members who care, but they are aware that a house condition survey would expose the hollowness of the self-congratulatory tone of the White Paper, the Bill and the Second Reading speech by the Secretary of State a few weeks ago. They know that a survey would expose whole areas of quite appalling conditions in Scottish housing and would thus invite demands from the public in Scotland for improvements, for investment and for a change in Government housing policy. They also know that those demands encouraged by such a survey would be impossible to satisfy within the restraints of the Thatcherite plan for Scotland, and so I suspect that they will resist the amendments calling for a house conditions survey.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My honourable Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) has said that it is not even professional to take a step into the darkness that is the major strategic shift in Scottish housing policy
	<span class='label label-info column'>160</span>
represented by the Government's plans for Scottish Homes without knowing the true position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if the Government intended to keep it secret, it would be better to have a house condition survey. We have heard many comparisions with the allusions to the work of the Scottish Development Agency. Does anyone seriously believe that the SDA would make a major public investment without any kind of survey of the terrain into which it was about to make that investment? It is ridiculous. Scottish Homes, without a survey, will be whistling in the dark. It will not know whether the housing policies and strategies that it is pursuing are correct because it will not know the true position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been said many times that there are lies, damned lies and statistics, but it is pretty near a damned lie to say that there are only 11,000 houses in the city of Glasgow that are below tolerable standards. Why is there that discrepancy between the Government's figure of 11,000 and Glasgow district council's figure of 44,000? In my very short time as a Glasgow Member of Parliament, I have come to know that there is a vast number of houses in the city of Glasgow that are below tolerable standard. The district council says 44,000. My opinion is that that, too, is an underestimate. Much will turn on what is a tolerable standard. Certainly, what is a tolerable standard for me or, even more, for the honourable and learned Member for Perth and Kinross, will be nothing like the standard enjoyed by the vast majority of people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the course of my constituency work I find conditions that are truly intolerable. I mentioned correspondence a little earlier. I could have brought to the Committee hundreds of letters that I have received in the seven or eight months that I have been a Member of Parliament about the presence in Glasgow—and I have no doubt in the rest of Scotland—of obsolete electrical wiring and equipment, which is largely unsurveyed in most parts of Scotland. In the city of Glasgow, the estimate is that 45,000 homes have obsolete electrical equipment and wiring. I am dealing with a case at present involving an unscrupulous landlord, whom I shall not name because I am not sure of the rules about privilege.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My honourable Friend can say what he likes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galloway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I had better not because I hope to win the case in the next couple of days. The constituent is an old lady aged 75, Mrs. McGoohan, of 3 Anderson Street in Glasgow. She has lived in that flat for 50 years and she knew the woman whose tenancy she took over, who had been in that flat for 25 years. We are therefore talking about two tenants in 75 years. There has been no work done on the electrical wiring in 75 years. One might say that that is the least of her worries. She has no running hot water, either, and the accommodation is in an abominable condition. The landlord simply has not been able to be moved to do anything about it, and even the presence of local authority grants—because they are not 100 per cent.—has not yet moved that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0167">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>161</span>
landlord to do anything, although I hope that he will do so soon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my honourable Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South said, a largely untalked-about sub-tolerable condition is the obsolescence of electrical wiring, equipment and heating. Who knows, if there are 45,000 in Glasgow, how many houses there are in that condition throughout Scotland? It is a very dangerous condition. I do not know, and I shall not hazard a guess, but how many of the fires that shock us all and about which we rightly express horror in the Chamber were caused by faulty, old, obsolete electrical equipment? We shall never know unless we have the kind of survey that the amendment is attempting to tease out of the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government talk about making a massive investment of public money, about a major strategic shift, yet I suspect that they are preparing to do it pretty much in the dark. That is of a piece with the way that they have handled the whole subject up to now, with the rush towards Scottish Homes, the rush into the dark that has characterised the exercise since the off-the-cuff promise during the election campaign, which in Scotland at least, as my honourable the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) said on Second Reading, was a flagging electoral campaign. Tossed into that campaign was the Scottish Homes proposal. Then came a White Paper in November; a Bill published on 3 December, comments to be in as early as 31 December, offering no opportunity for genuine consultation—a headlong rush into the dark, whistling in the dark, not really knowing, many people not really caring about, the true position of Scottish housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I looked at the White Paper again last night. For a piece of hollow self-congratulation it takes the biscuit. I make no apology for repeating what my honourable Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) said. Paragraph 1.16 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There have been enormous improvements in housing conditions during this century."</p></blockquote>
I do not know whether the Under-Secretary of State, the honourable Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) is taking the credit for those enormous improvements, and I do not think that anyone seriously believes that we should congratulate ourselves that there have been enormous improvements in housing in this century. After all, at the beginning of the century the housing conditions in this country, certainly in the city of Glasgow and in my constituency, were literally indescribable. It would fall within the remit of an obscene publication to publish the housing conditions that existed in the early part of the century.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Immediately following that the White Paper states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"there are very few remaining slums".</p></blockquote>
That is not true. It depends how one defines slums, of course, but even by the traditional definition I certainly have more than a few slum houses in my constituency—There are tens, perhaps hundreds, of thousands of people in Scotland who still live in
	<span class='label label-info column'>162</span>
slums. My honourable Friend the Member for Dundee, East mentioned dampness. A house that is dripping with damp is a slum. Whether it was built in the 1960s or in 1910 or 1890, it is still a slum. He talked about the dampness that comes through walls, goes through the backs of wardrobes and infests the clothes inside with fungus. This may all be foreign material to Conservative Members. They may not have constituents in those conditions. Certainly very few of them have ever experienced them themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My honourable Friend is being less than fair to the Under-Secretary of State. He used to be a member of a Select Committee on Scottish Affairs, which undertook a study on dampness in housing in Scotland, and we visited a district council housing estate in what was then part of his own constituency, Pilton. I remember that he expressed horror at what he saw in some of the buildings in that part of the city—the dampness and all the rest of it. He has seen it with his own eyes. He has now the opportunity to do something about it, and we are waiting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galloway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In this, as in so many of our contributions in the Committee, we must except the Minister from our admonitions. He is one of those who care. I suspect that he would quite like to have a survey, although he would quickly be jumped on from on high were he to agree to one, because it would have the effect that I described earlier. Certainly his right honourable and learned Friend the Secretary of State knows, or should know, about these conditions, as many thousands of homes in his constituency fall into that category, although I suspect that precious few of the tenants in his constituency who live in homes which could be described as below tolerable rewarded him with their votes on 11th June last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Dampness on the scale that exists in Scottish housing is a major factor in the creation of slum housing; it makes no difference if it is modern slum housing. My honourable Friend the Member for Dundee, East talked about the dampness that he saw. I had a case in my surgery last Friday of a person living in a multi-storey block who brought in, so that I could see the evidence, not only a coat infested with fungus but children's toys—teddy bears and dolls—black with fungus created by the dampness in the house. If I had read my constituent paragraph 1.16 of the White Paper and said "Come now. There have been enormous improvements in housing conditions during this century. Almost all houses now have the basic amenities and there are very few remaining slums", I am not sure that she would have found it very edifying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not simply the White Paper which claims enormous improvements in the past century. The Secretary of State for Scotland said on Second Reading that the last decade had been

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galloway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They certainly have been substantial negative achievements, disgraceful indictments on the Government's presidency over that period. The Government have certainly presided over a doubling of homelessness. With their successive cuts in the amount of public money that they have allowed to go into housing they have done nothing to solve the problems—which existed before they came into office. The record on public housing of all Governments and many local authorities over a long period has led to this situation. This Government have not only made that worse but have shown no sign, in the strategic drift of their thinking, of being interested in turning that situation around. If they were, they would agree to a survey—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was about to call the ancient cry, "I spy strangers", but I think that I recognise the honourable Members for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart). I suppose we should be grateful that he is one of those who are prepared to stand up and debate these matters. Perhaps he will give us the benefit of his thinking on the need for a housing condition survey.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There can be no excuse for the Government, when taking a major step in housing strategy such as this, not even being prepared to concede the principle of a housing condition survey. I do not expect, especially in the light of the Secretary of State's shake of the head a minute or two ago, the Minister now to stand up and agree to such a survey. But it would be doing the Committee an injustice if he did not even concede that it is needed and would be a good idea, even if he is not prepared to put it into the Bill or to agree now to the necessary expenditure. He must agree that in the circumstances of this major step, a house condition survey would be professional and proper in the stewardship of Scottish housing. I hope that the broad range of arguments deployed to support the amendments will force a recognition from the Minister that whistling in the dark is not the best way forward for Scottish housing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is clear from the evidence presented by my honourable Friends that the Government's treatment of Scottish housing and their failure even to attempt to ascertain its true condition is scandalous. The Government challenge any figures produced to counter their smug and complacement view of the state of Scottish housing and their contention that slum conditions have been eradicated. But that is far from the truth. As my honourable Friend the Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galloway) said, slum conditions abound in Scotland today. The purpose of the amendment is to achieve a house condition survey that will allow us to plan for the future of housing in Scotland in the private and public sectors and not for its destruction by design or collusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have ignored the evidence of more than 50 district and island authorities as well as the evidence of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, the Institute of Housing, the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations, Age Concern Scotland and all those independent bodies which are worried about the state of housing in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>164</span>
The amendment seeks to establish beyond doubt the conditions which appertain in housing in Scotland today. Thousands of Scottish homes are not fit for pigs to live in; hundreds of thousands are riddled with dampness and defects. That is what the Government are frightened to admit. Why does the Secretary of State, who is responsible not simply for Scotland but for a constituency in the city of Edinburgh, not believe the evidence of his eyes? Surely he, to, has tenants who have brought to him damp clothes and have shown him houses in his constituency which are riddled with damp and where carpets, clothes, furniture and the very bedding are damp. The Secretary of State must have seen that with his own eyes, if he is a conscientious constituency Member of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary of State, the Minister responsible for housing, has a constituency which contained and still contains some of the worst housing not just in Edinburgh—a scandal for a capital city—but in Scotland. He, too, must have had people coming to him with damp clothes, showing him damp furniture and other manifestations of dampness which have such a devastating effect. If he intends to deny it, I give him the opportunity to deny it now. But he knows, as well all know in this Room and as anybody concerned with Scottish housing knows, that there is abundant evidence that housing conditions throughout Scotland are dire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to establish the state of that housing. The White Paper was nothing more than a withewash. It did not get to the root of the problems. Indeed, in the opinion of many, including myself, it was designed both to confuse the issue and to avoid any detailed examination of the real problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister, the Secretary of State and his colleagues do not believe the evidence of their own eyes, why do they not take on board the evidence presented to them by independent organisations? The Scottish Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux has written me saying that it is concerned that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the remit of Scottish Homes as outlined in the Bill will not enable the new agency to make a significant contribution to assessing and meeting housing need in Scotland".</p></blockquote>
With the experience of more than 500,000 inquiries a year, it stresses the need for a proper assessment and it wrote to me complaining of the Secretary of State's and Government's failure in the Bill to take that on board in any shape or form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

in Edinburgh, a house condition survey would put beyond doubt the figures which the Secretary of State disputes, of the 5,357 houses in the capital city which require major repairs, where roofs leak, windows let in rain, and floors are uneven and cracked. It would establish beyond doubt the 7,810 houses indentified by Edinburgh district council which require comprehensive modernisation; the 16,000 houses which require some further form of modernisation, with a total bill of £132 million to rectify them, of which 4,000 are pre-war houses; the 12,000 post-war houses that need modernisation; the 3,000 houses that need rewiring; and the council houses in Edinburgh which require some £4 million spent to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0169">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>165</span>
remove antiquated electric central heating systems which tenants find impossible to heat and millionaires would find difficult to fund. A house condition survey would establish the state of dampness in the city's housing stock and, further, the state of Scottish housing throughout the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problems of system-built housing will not be strange to the Secretary of State, for in his constituency are included a number of the 5,600 system-built defective houses which require a staggering amount spent on them. The Government deny these figures, but fail to seek the proper evidence to establish them. The Minister responsible for housing knows, because Orlit's is in his own constituency, that in Edinburgh there are more than 800 Orlit houses, some of which have had to be demolished, all of which require substantial sums spent on them. In addition there are 500 prefabricated reinforced concrete houses that require money spent on them; the 2,300 no-fines houses; and the 12,000 post-war non-traditional houses. All these figures could be established beyond doubt if the Minister had a house condition survey, but he is not willing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have shamefully underplayed the state of the problem. The White Paper refers to the 81 per cent. increase in capital investment with which local authorities have been assisted over the past three years. It is interesting that they should choose as their starting-point for comparison, a year when the capital allocations in Scotland fell to an all-time low. They know that if they look at the years from 1979 until then, and at years since then, they, too, would show a shameful neglect on the Government's part in housing investment. That is the real reason why they are against a house condition survey. They know that, if they looked over a 10-year rather than a three-year period, the capital investment trends would have given, by this financial year, an additional £817 million which the Government have effectively cut, and resulted in misery for individuals and the dilapidation of property on which honourable Members have focused.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of the below tolerable standard houses are in the private sector, and it is hardly surprising that the Government are not willing to admit to its true extent, because the Secretary of State does not even know the official definition of "below tolerable standard". Speaking in the debate on 11th January, he said that a number of house in Scotland 10 years ago:
	<br><blockquote><p>"were deemed to be below tolerable standard—that is, without some of the basic amenities". 	<i>[Official Report,</i> 11 January 1988, Vol. 125, c.41.]</p></blockquote>
That is a statement of appalling ignorance from the Secretary of State for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right honourable and learned Gentleman has only to refer to section 86 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987—which he has probably never seen—to see the list of nine categories of defects to "below tolerable standard". It is not, as he mistakenly claimed, the lack of "some basic amenities". It is the
	<span class='label label-info column'>166</span>
fact that some properties are structurally stable or unstable, are substantially free from rising or penetrating damp. No wonder the Secretary of State closes his eyes to these facts, because they are far more embarrassing, and push up the figure far higher than he would like to admit or to which he would concede resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not surprising that we now have the most ill-informed, ignorant and callous team of Scottish Ministers that we have ever seen. They do not even know the laws that they pass. They speak in the House of Commons glibly, without even a note to refer to, so that it is hardly suprising that they get it wrong, time and time again. The fact that they do not care about the state of Scottish housing, and more importantly, about the conditions in which people live, is much more serious and surprising for Members of the party that claims to care, but there are precious few of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of Tory Members have refused to associate themselves with the Secretary of State and his Front Bench team, and will not join them in the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs. One of the reasons for that is that they do not want to be allied to a sham, in terms of an inquiry by the Front Bench team into Scotland's problems, which they knew they are approaching with closed minds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The true extent of housing below tolerable standards, which would be revealed by the house condition survey which the amendment seeks to promote, would show that some 18,000 houses in Edinburgh are below tolerable standard, not the 5,300 claimed by the Government; and that an additional 32,000 houses in our capital city suffer from disrepair which is not at the below tolerable standard level as defined by the nine criteria set out in the Act, rather than the Secretary of State's arbitrary definition, but nonetheless are in serious disrepair and require attention now, which would be cheaper than letting the buildings deteriorate and having to spend more in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's statistics state that 54,000 houses in Scotland are below tolerable standard, but local studies in Edinburgh and Glasgow show that, in addition to the 18,000 houses that I have already mentioned in Edinburgh, there are some 44,500 houses, making a total of 62,500 below tolerable standard—far more than the Government's own figure—in Glasgow and Edinburgh alone. We know from honourable Members who represent rural constituencies that the problem is as bad there, if not in scale, certainly in degree, and in terms of proportions of houses affected is worse than in Glasgow with its 44,500 hourses below tolerable standard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be wise for the Government to put the figures that we have used today beyond reasonable doubt, as their colleagues in England and Wales have earnestly tried to do, so that we can programme in Scoltand to tackle the housing problems that still exist. If the Government refuse to accept the amendment, they will be confirming the statement that I and other honourable Members have made that they are the most ill-informed, ignorant and callous

Government that we have seen representing us in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to respond to this important debate. In answer to the points that have been raised, we certainly believe strongly in the value and importance of local authority surveys, which is why we wrote into section 85(3) of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Every local authority shall from time to time cause to be made such a survey or inspection of their district as may be necessary for the performance of the duty imposed on them by subsection (1) or for the purpose of ascertaining the availability of alternative housing accommodation."</p></blockquote>
In recent guidance to local authorities, electrical wiring is one of the matters that authorities are recommended to cover in their surveys.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galloway) wanted to know what had happened. Since 1979, almost 241,000 improvement and repairs grants have been approved. That is equivalent to between one in five and one in four of all the privately owned houses in Scotland. I shall come back to the discrepancy between the figures for houses below tolerable standard in a moment. As a result of improvement grants, almost £700 million has been spent since 1979, and the number of houses below the tolerable standard has, according to our figures, fallen to almost a third of what it was in 1979: 57,000 now compared with 150,000 then.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised by the figures that the Minister suggests. He said 150,000 down to 57,000 in the past 10 years, whereas on Second Reading his right honourable Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland said that they had come down from 120,000 to 55,000. They cannot both be right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My information comes from the Scottish Office. In relation to figures on below tolerable standard, the Scottish Office gets its figures from local authorities. On a subject such as "below tolerable standard" the figures do not remain wholly static. Houses are being improved all the time, and at the same time other houses that have been built relatively recently may go through a period of crisis and come on to that list.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of the 93,000 houses that have been improved or demolished, how many were in the public sector and how many in the private sector?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The improvement grants relate primarily to the private sector. I shall try to give the honourable Gentleman more information about that before I sit down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Glasgow, Hillhead also asked what else had been done. One hundred and fifty eight thousand new homes have been constructed since 1979. I agree that many of those are in the private sector, but that is a substantial number of new houses, when the population has been going down steadily. Also, the number of houses for the elderly and disabled is more than four times greater than it was in 1979. I mention these facts to show that a certain amount is happening in this area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>168</span>
	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galloway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that there were lies, damned lies and statistics. There is a serious discrepancy between the figures that the Under-Secretary quoted and those that the Secretary of State quoted on Second Reading about the number of houses that were and are below tolerable standard. If they cannot agree on such basic facts, what credibility and weight are we to give to those statistics? Surely this latest example, even as we sit here, proves the need for a proper, serious, professional survey of housing conditions in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall make urgent inquiries into that point. I assure the honourable Gentlemen that I have the figures in black and white in my briefing. However, he will accept my point that the figures are not static.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must get on because I have many points to answer. The honourable Gentleman can intervene at the end of my remarks if he thinks that I have not dealt with his points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) suggested that improvement grants had been withdrawn. They were not withdrawn, they were adjusted. The ordinary rate for a repair grant has been 50 per cent. for many years. The 90 per cent. rate was a temporary measure, and that was made clear. In housing action areas where the improvement required is substantial, the rate is still 75 per cent., rising to 90 per cent. in case of need. Of course, it is important that surveys be carried out in rural areas, by district councils, as well as in cities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) referred to Glasgow district council's figures. The figures submitted to me by the Scottish Office came from the district councils. Glasgow carried out its own survey, and its figures were different from those that had been submitted earlier. We are considering the Glasgow figures and any others that have changed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is making the case for a comprehensive approach to the survey. We are all wallowing in figures that differ one from the other, which shows that the Scottish Office is working on duff figures. Whether the figures are the Minister's or the Secretary of State's, it is interesting that they have managed to lose 50,000 houses during the past few weeks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the figures were not static.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that that was on the basis of figures given to the Scottish Office by local authorities. Without a framework and funding for a properly recognised survey, local authorities are bound to produce inaccurate figures. The only sub-tolerable standard houses that they will
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0171">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>169</span>
know about are those drawn to their attention. Unless they actually go out looking for such houses, they are unlikely to find them. Glasgow, has gone out to look for such houses on a scientific basis, and now has some accurate figures. Does that not demonstrate the case for a proper survey?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We wrote into the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 a section to deal with that problem and to enable local authorities to carry out the necessary surveys. I have no doubt that they will do so to an ever-increasing extent that obligation is laid on them by that section.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for East Lothian asked whether the majority of sub-tolerable houses were in the public or private sector. The greatest reduction in sub-tolerable houses is undoubtedly in the private sector, because it relates primarily to older property. There is a full system of housing plans that local authorities prepare, usually on a three-year cycle—although in Glasgow's case, on an annual basis. That is fair, bearing in mind that Glasgow has the largest stock of public sector housing in Western Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 85 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 requires authorities to carry out surveys. They are not yet carried out by all authorities, but we shall encourage them to do so. Professor Duncan Maclennan is on record as saying that he supports local surveys. In a recent statement in 	<i>The Scotsman</i> on 21 December, he said of Glasgow,
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the 1985 housing conditions survey which has just been published, you find that 54 per cent. of the council house tenants would prefer to organise their own repairs. That suggests a fair degree of unhappiness."</p></blockquote>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local surveys are extremely useful in identifying local needs and requirements in the areas concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No honourable Member could-v disagree with the Minister about the value of surveys to find out local problems. We are discussing a national problem—a national Scottish housing crisis that spreads across district councils and their boundaries. We want an overall picture of housing needs in Scotland so that the Government, in conjunction with Scottish Homes and the district councils, can begin to release the resources necessary for a national strategy to deal with the crisis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has missed the point entirely, but the district councils and the local planning authorities to which he keeps referring understand it. COSLA is pressing the Minister for a national Scottish house condition survey, and he should give way to that pressure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Every year local authorities put in their bids to the Scottish Office for their housing revenue account allocations, which are assessed on the basis of need. I have no doubt that many more authorities will take up the recommendation of making such very important local surveys.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 18 covers two separate but related matters. It seeks to subject Scottish Homes to a duty to consider housing needs in Scotland and to
	<span class='label label-info column'>170</span>
secure the provision of housing to meet needs. In addition, Scottish Homes is to be given a duty of carrying out a national house condition survey at least every five years. Amendment No. 57 is similar in its objectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments relates to duties that are already the responsibility of local authorities. The relevant statutory provisions, which date back to at least 1966, are consolidated in the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987. Section 1 requires local authorities to consider the housing conditions and the needs of their areas for further housing accommodation. Section 2 empowers an authority to provide housing, and section 85(3) requires authorities to carry out surveys or inspections in regard to their duty under section 85(1), which deals with houses below the tolerable standard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for drawing our attention to the terms of section 85. Am I to understand that he is saying that it will be the responsibility of, for example the Aberdeen district council, which has something like 37,000 houses in the city, to carry out an assessment for Scottish Homes, or at least for any Scottish Homes in the district of Aberdeen, under section 85? I find it difficult to understand why that should be so when Scottish Homes will be landlord to about 83,000 houses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman is anticipating my next comment, which is that it is important to avoid duplication.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must press the Minister on that. As I understand it—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman can come back if he feels that I have not dealt adequately with the point. Amendment No. 48 and, in a slightly different way, amendment No. 84 appear to be aimed at relieving local authorities of their statutory duties in assessing need and house condition. That is against our desire, strongly expressed in the White Paper, that local authorities should pay more attention to their vital strategic role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that, in some areas, Scottish Homes and the local authority will have to work closely together to develop a strategy based on a thorough assessment of the facts. However, I doubt whether local authorities would welcome the imposition of such a requirement to agree methods of assessment. Indeed, I doubt whether a "requirement to co-operate" could ever be successful, and I advise against the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that Scottish Homes will be a valuable partner for local authorities in carrying out those statutory duties. The Scottish Special Housing Association proved to be a major force in Scottish housing in exactly that role. In another area the Housing Corporation in Scotland has done useful work in assessing the part that housing associations can play in providing for Scotland's future housing needs. Scottish Homes will inherit both those components. It would be wrong to place statutory
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0172">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>171</span>
duties on two separate bodies, local authorities and Scottish Homes. Honourable Members will appreciate that such dual responsibility would be unworkable in practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the primary responsibility is to be placed on the local authority—in my own case, Aberdeen city—who pays? Is my local authority expected to pay for a survey that we believe should be paid for by Scottish Homes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the position. Our best assessment of the cost of a national survey is just over £5 million, which will have to come out of the housing budget. The issue is not just one of cost in isolation, but of cost in relation to the value of the survey's results. I ask Opposition Members to question a national survey, which cannot tell us much about specific areas, would be as useful as a full set of local surveys.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that it would be a wicked imposition for central Government to direct Scottish Homes to conduct the national survey over the heads of local authorities. That would be more convincing were it not for the fact that COSLA is pressing us to do precisely that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, the statement about the surveys carried out by local authorities would be more convincing if first, the Government were to provide the funds to enable local authorities to carry out the job and, secondly, they were to pay a blind bit of attention of the information given to them by the local authorities.
	<span class='label label-info column'>172</span>
Surely there is a need for a national survey to enable Scottish Homes to do its job properly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The cost of the local authority surveys will be supported either by rate support grant or by housing support grant, depending on whether the local authority has decided to charge the expenditure to the general rate fund or to the housing revenue account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the point about COSLA, I have made it clear that local authorities have ample powers to carry out any survey or inspection of their areas to establish housing conditions. The Government are assisting that task by the preparation, with COSLA, of a local house condition survey kit, which will be available this year to give practical help to local authorities in carrying out surveys. We are not, as yet, convinced that a larger survey would yield results at below district level unless the sample size was large, and consequently expensive. However, we are considering further the question of a national survey, and there the matter rests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
