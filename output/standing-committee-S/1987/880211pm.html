	<p>	<i>Amendments proposed [this day]:</i> No. 253, in page 11, line 10, leave out 'one month' and insert 'three months'.—[	<i>Mr. Home Robertson.</i>]</p>
	<p>4.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are taking amendment No. 254, in page 11, line 15, leave out 'month' and insert 'three months.'</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Fairbairn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Perth and Kinross)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am anxious to speak to the proposed amendments, which have merit for the following reasons. In the Bill a month is allowed for a notice given by landlord to tenant, or by tenant to landlord, after which, if unchallenged, it becomes unchallengeable. A month is a very short time. The person may be away or ill or, even worse, may not receive the letter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a dangerous precept that either the tenant or the landlord should be able to allege that notice of a change of condition was sent a month earlier and if there is no challenge the change automatically becomes a new clause in the contract. It would be a real rogues' charter. Either party could allege that he had genuinely sent it although the other party had not received it, or either party could allege that he had sent it when in fact he had not. It is a dangerous precept that within a month, in the absence of a reply, it can be assumed the contract is altered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to look favourably on the amendments, and to say that the matter may be reviewed by those before whom it comes. If one party says, totally dishonestly, that he sent a notice, and the other party says, totally honestly, that he did not receive it, it is a bad principle for that to be sufficient to alter. Alternatively, if one party sent the notice and the other received it but chose to allege that he had not received it, it would be an equally bad principle. I ask the Minister to look carefuly at this because it is an inequitable concept.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to respond to my honourable and learned Friend. It would have helped if he had said what period he thought would be most suitable. Three months is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>626</span>
proposed in the amendment, but I will consider the matter. I cannot give a hard commitment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not say that I am against periods, but any period could be unsuitable. With respect to the Minister, it would be wise if it was within the discretion of the commissioners to decide whether in all circumstance it was equitable to say that something allegedly or actually proposed was in fact so. I should infinitely prefer those who have to decide the matter in all the circumstances to have some discretion rather than leaving it to a fixed period of a particular duration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The length of time should be a balance between the interests of the tenant and those of the landlord. The person giving notice is entitled to know, within a reasonable period, if it is to be challenged. Any length of time giving notice might be too short for landlord and tenant in certain unusual circumstances, but if it were set so long as to cover every conceivable circumstance and eventuality the person serving the notice would have to wait an unreasonably long time before knowing whether the proposals were likely to be accepted. The criticism of the serving of notices at present is that it can take a very long time to achieve a conclusion to the matter, and a shorter period is in the interests of all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is unrealistic if applied to a person working in Saudi Arabia, or who is unconscious or who has not received the notice. It is not a question of time. There should be a discretion to say, in the circumstances, that it would not be fair for one party to change the contract one-sidedly on the allegation that the other party had not replied within one month, regardless of whether he was alive, dead, abroad, on holiday or anything else. It does not matter whether it is one month, six months or a thousand months. There ought to be a discretion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If a person does not receive the notice, that is a relevant and important point. In practice, recorded delivery post is the most common method used, and a recorded delivery receipt is kept as evidence of service. In the past this matter has been governed by section 114 of the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984, which provides that
	<br><blockquote><p>"A notice or other document which requires to be served on a person … may be given to him—
	<ol>
	<li>by delivering it to him;</li>
	<li>by leaving it at his proper address;</li>
	<li>by sending it by recorded delivery post to him at that address."</li></ol></p></blockquote>
A person's proper address is his last known address. The provision in the Bill is similar to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Being in Parliament and not at home in Scotland, recorded delivery post is regularly marked "Could not deliver" and I do not get it. If I happen to be in Saudi Arabia, in hospital, on holiday, in Parliament or wherever, I do not get it. Recorded delivery is not a record of the fact that I have received it. It is a record only of the fact that someone has attempted unsuccessfully to deliver it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0424">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>627</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This comes back to my original point. The length of time has to be a balance between the interests of the tenant and those of the landlord. Either might serve a notice. I accept that there is no particular magic in the one-month period, but it is right to expect that an appeal in these circumstances should be made reasonably quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us take the example of a tenant who proposes to take over responsibility for certain repairs, which were previously the responsibility of the landlord. As a result, quite fairly, he wants the rent reduced. It would be wrong to require him to wait as long as three months to see whether the landlord intended to object to that change. It would then take the rent assessment committee some time to make its determination. On balance, a shorter period is about right. It gives both landlord and tenant a reasonable opportunity to consider the proposal, and to decide whether the proposals are acceptable. It also means that a final decision on the proposed terms will be reached reasonably quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore cannot support the amendment in those terms, but I can say to my honourable and learned Friend that I will consider the matter and will write to him in due course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not a question of whether it should be one month, or six weeks, or three months. The point is that with an absolute period, however long, the alteration proposed, whether by the tenant or the landlord, automatically takes effect if it is not challenged and the tribunal can do nothing about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the landlord writes to the tenant saying, "You may not use coal fires, you are not allowed to have children and your dogs are to be shot," if the tenant does not reply within the time limit that proposal automatically takes effect. If the tenant then says that he never received the notice and the recorded delivery was not achieved because he was abroad, unconcious, on a six-month course at the university of Saskatchewan or whatever, that does not matter and the proposal automatically applies. That is mad. There ought to be a discretion for the tribunal to say that in the circumstances it believes that it would be inequitable and unfair to make the absolute, whether it be against the tenant or against the landlord, just because somebody claims that he wrote. He need only claim that he has written. I beg my honourable Friend to understand the situation. If I claim to have written to a tenant saying that from 1 June his rent will be increased from tuppence to £2,000 per week and that if he does not challenge that within a month it will be absolute, even if the tenant never received the letter he will be powerless to do anything about it. How does one decide whether a person actually sent a notice or merely alleged that he sent it, or received it or whether the other party failed to receive it or simply pretended that he had not received it? Under the clause as it stands, there is no answer. One month after notice is allegedly sent of a variation in the contract, it is absolute if not challenged. That is a very strange concept.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Arbuthnot 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wanstead and Woodford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am somewhat diffident about disagreeing with my
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>628</span>
honourable and learned Friend in view of his experience of Scottish law and my own lack of it, but the subsection begins:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where a notice has been served under subsection (2) above".</p></blockquote>
If it were merely a matter of allegation that the notice had been served when in fact it had not, the two following sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) would never arise. The tenant would be able to say that the notice had not been served in the first place, so the rights of the landlord referred to subsequently would not arise. In those circumstances, the tenant would surely be able to challenge whether the notice had been served in the first place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Law Society of Scotland has advised us that part II of the Bill is likely to provide a fruitful area for litigation. The interesting debate between the honourable and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn) and the honourable Member for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Arbuthnot) gives us an intriguing trailer of things to come. The honourable and learned Member for Perth and Kinross has touched on what is probably the most interesting aspect, namely where a tenant can say that he never received the notice at all. There are other variations on the theme. The notice might have been served on the tenant, but as the honourable and learned Member for Perth and Kinross has said, he might not be there for a multitude of reasons. Under the preamble to subsection (3) the notice would have been served according to the law, even though the tenant might not find it until after he came home, when the time had already run out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or the landlord.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All right—in the present spirit of unanimity, let us worry about the landlord as well although I am principally anxious about the tenant. The rent assessment committee is to have no discretion, no matter how reasonable or unreasonable the circumstances might be. The terms dictated by the landlord—or the tenant, as the honourable and learned Gentleman would like me to to say—will apply after the calendar has clocked up that one month, and there is no escaping it. That seems completely unreasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am surprised that the Minister is being so difficult in the face of eminently reasonable suggestions both from the Opposition and from his honourable and learned Friend. I will not necessarily insist on pressing the amendment, but we must have an undertaking from the Government that they will review the matter and give some scope for the rent assessment committee to exercise judgment and take account of the circumstances surrounding the case. If the Minister refuses to think about this, we must press the matter to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumfries)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While my honourable Friend the Minister is contemplating his reply, I wish to inquire of him whether there is not a parallel in planning. I receive many complaints about that, as my honourable Friend the Minister knows
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0425">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>629</span>
from letters that I have written to his predecessor. If a person applies for a planning alteration to his property he is in duty bound to serve a notice on the neighbours that he has applied to the planning authority for such permission. Frequently, however, although the applicant may tell the planning authority that he has written to the neighbours, that has not in fact taken place. There is no come-back. The planning authority does not check, but takes the applicant's word for it. There is an exact parallel here. The authorities take the landlord's word for it that he has sent a notice to the tenant although there is no proof that it has been done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The crux of the matter is not necessarily that the time is wrong. There must be some kind of double check that the tenant has in fact received the letter. One might say that if the landlord has received notice back within a month that the tenant has received it, that might be a different kettle offish. There must be some sort of proven response before such draconian effects can take place as the rent being increased or, as my honourable and learned Friend the Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn) put it, the dog is shot, which would cause a great furore. It is not necessarily the time that is important, but some response must be received from the tenant before anything can take place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a useful debate. Two separate issues have been raised, one in the context of the amendment—the length of the time—the other by my honourable and learned Friend the Member for Perth and Kinross concerning the discretion which might lie within the rent assessment committee's jurisdiction. On the matter raised by my honourable Friend the Member for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Arbuthnot) and my honourable Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Monro), the evidence of delivery required at present is a recorded delivery receipt, or execution of service by a sheriff's officer, or admission of recipient, or proof of ordinary posting with no evidence of non-receipt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will consider the points made, both on the length of time and on the separate matters raised by my honourable and learned Friend the Member for Perth and Kinross. I cannot give a guarantee or commitment, but I will consider them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister must understand that if I do not get a Valentine card from him this year, I shall not be able to prove it, and if I do get one, unless he signs it in his magnificent handwriting, I shall not be able to prove that I have. None of the idiotic concepts of proof of receipt seems to me to be sufficient.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister mentioned that one of the criteria for evidence of delivery would be proof of ordinary posting. Will he explain to the Committe how one proves that one has posted a letter? Secondly, he mentioned absence of proof that it had not been received. Will he explain that to the Committee also?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>630</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The obvious way is a recorded delivery receipt. If one posts a letter in the ordinary way and has a photocopy of the envelope, that is evidence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Member is asking what evidence will count.

Amendment No. 265 has again been suggested by Shelter (Scotland). Its purpose is to give the right to refer a notice proposing changes in the terms of a statutory assured tenancy other than on the amount of rent to a sheriff rather than to a rent assessment committee. The rent assessment committees have experience and training in property valuation, not in the terms and conditions of tenancies. In other cases where tenancy terms and conditions are at issue, a reference for arbitration is to the court. That is cited in section 53 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 and section 2 of the Mobile Homes Act 1983. Sheriffs have greater experience of dealing with such matters than rent assessment committees and the sheriff court would appear better placed to determine for assured tenancies where mutual agreement cannot be reached. Sheriffs have the expertise whereas rent assessment committees do not. On that basis, I commend the amendment to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I join in this small debate. This is an important point. I feel that rent assessment committees are asked to do too much in the Bill; the later clauses, their situation will get worse rather than better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can see no logic in the proposal. I should like to hear why the Government decided to move in this direction. The sheriff court, in my experience, is by far the more appropriate place. It is an open forum to which people have access and where they can have legal representation after proper application for legal aid. All sorts of avenues are open with the forum of the sheriff court. I do not think the equivalent exists in the rent assessment committee. Rent assessment committees will be extremely overworked and overloaded, certainly in the short term if not in the long term. I shall be interested to hear what estimate the Government have made of the increase in staff, resources and facilities that rent assessment committees will require in order to discharge the new functions and duties given to them by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I envisage all kinds of chaos emanating from rent assessment committees if the provision is maintained. Moreover it is more difficult for rent assessment committees to establish common standards throughout the length and breadth of Scotland than it is for a sheriff court. Sheriffs' decisions can always be reviewed in the normal process of Scots law and they are frequently reported extensively in the legal journals and law reports. There are many compelling reasons for substituting the sheriff court for the rent assessment committee. I am genuinely puzzled as to why the Government actively and deliberately opted for the rent assessment committee for this function.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) was unfair to rent assessment committees when he suggested that they were not sufficiently well qualified as they include at least one lawyer, one surveyor and one layman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall come in a moment to the two reasons for this development, in response to the honourable Member for East Lothian. I am aware that sheriffs already act as arbiters in disputes on commercial leases, with which they are ideally qualified to deal. They are also involved under existing legislation when a landlord seeks to evict a tenant. I do not deny that they have expert knowledge of the housing market. That knowledge will continue to be of immense value once the legislation is in place. However, I do not believe that the sheriff would be the right source of determinations in appeals under clause 17. The rent assessment committees have built up a formidable degree of expertise in housing matters. Their interest is specialised in that area. They are therefore in a good position to make sensible judgments about whether the terms proposed for a tenancy are reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other advantage that the rent assessment committee has over the sheriff court is that its proceedings are less formal. The formality of courts
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>632</span>
can overawe and dissuade people, especially ordinary tenants, from exercising their rights. It is important that tenants and landlords should not feel inhibited from appealing under clause 17.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about poor lawyers? Legal aid is available for cases of this kind and would give employment to poor lawyers struggling to make a living.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are not here to argue for our own interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not a poor lawyer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can accept that comment from my honourable and learned Friend with complete certainty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important for tenants and landlords not to feel inhibited from appealing under clause 17. I am sure that making the arbiter the rent assessement committee is the best way to ensure that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am fascinated that the honourable Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) takes the view that a sheriff is not capable of interpreting "suitably" but would be a better person to decide this matter than a rent assessment committee. As one who is fond of good English, the concept of the rent assessment committee is not my idea of magic. Nevertheless, it is astonishing that in a previous debate it was suggested that the sheriff court could not be charged with deciding what was "suitable" alternative accommodation, yet we are now told that it would be better than a rent assessment committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not like rent assessment committees. I do not like the concept that if there is one Ranger, one Celtic and one agnostic, it is a fair jury. One cannot imagine anything more partial than a committee on which everybody has inimical views to all the others. I do not take the view that a Lesbian, a homosexual and a heterosexual form a fair jury. I am therefore not in favour of rent assessment committees. Nevertheless I should like to know why the Opposition think that a fellow who cannot understand the word "suitable" is preferable in this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Doran 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The simple point is about protecting the interests of tenants. We seem to be moving away from that in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make a couple of short points. The first thing that concerns me, to echo a point made when we discussed the constitution of Scottish Homes, is that rent assessment committees are yet another example of the patronage which lies with the Secretary of State. All members of rent assessment committees, including the chairmen, are appointed by the Secretary of State. Patronage runs right through the system. The honourable and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn) will doubtless point out that sheriffs are also so appointed, but that they have a different function.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>633</span>
A number of issues could be raised, but what concerns me most is the protection to which tenants are entitled. I am concerned that the Minister in his response to the point made by my honourable Friend the Member for East Lothian said that tenants might be dissuaded from using the sheriff courts because they were more formal and awe-inspiring. If tenants are likely to be dissuaded, so are landlords. I see it as an encouragement to both sides to sit down and sort out the difficulties. As for the equity of using the rent assessment committees, in my experience it is difficult to find the resources to provide proper representation at a rent assessment committee. At present, if an application is required to the sheriff court, for whatever purpose, legal aid will be available. The rent assessment committee, however, is a tribunal and no legal aid is available. Legal advice and assistance may have been available at one time, but the scheme is becoming so restrictive that its flexibility is being watered down and would not allow for representation at a rent assessment committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tenants are losing considerable rights because of the Bill. I am concerned that the Minister is not taking on board the fact that if one sets up a system for arbitration there will be an unequal weighting because tenants, especially those in receipt of housing benefit, will not be able to afford proper representation at rent assessment committees. They will not have the resources available to them, whereas at the sheriff court the state provides resources because it recognises the importance of legal assistance in a legal forum. The rent assessment committee is not legal forum, although legal advice is crucial to a tenant when a lease is being rewritten.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Many of the proceedings will be relatively informal and straightforward. People appointed to rent assessment committees are highly responsible individuals. The honourable Gentleman said that they were appointed by the Secretary of State for Scotland, but I stress that they are appointed on the recommendation of professional and other bodies. There are rights of appeal on points of law to the Court of Session. Presumably, whenever there is an appeal—where there is a serious dispute that cannot readily be resolved—there will be the possibility of legal aid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member also asked about extra staff and resources. Extra staff will probably be needed for the rent assessment committees. There are only about 11 staff now. The matter will be kept under review.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the only way in which he envisages legal advice being available is when there is an appeal, but those are not regular cases in the mass of cases with which rent assessment committees will deal. They will be dealing with the virtual rewriting of the terms and conditions of the lease which the Bill will allow. It is at the drafting stage that legal advice and representation are necessary. It is no good going to a rent assessment committee, which will be heavily biased towards the landlord's interests. I do not intend to impugn the current membership of rent assessment committees
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>634</span>
in Scotland, but the representation available will mean that the tenants' interests will not be properly represented. They will have to wait for an appeal, in the Minister's view, before they will be entitled to any legal advice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A certain amount of advice is given by citizens' advice bureaux, but in this matter, those who serve on the rent assessment committee are not exactly like a jury. They have the accumulation of expertise of a lawyer, a surveyor and another member of the public specially chosen. The surveyor, in particular, has the local knowledge of property and rent values. Not every sheriff has that knowledge without a technical assessor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are obviously getting nowhere in deploying the arguments so far. One thing that concerns me in my constituency and in south-east Scotland as a whole, is the fact that rent assessment committees in my experience—it is some time since I have had anything to do with the individual proceedings of any of them, so the practice may have changed—are not in the habit of meeting locally. They meet in places like Edinburgh, 60 miles or more from where my constituents live. That is not the case with the sheriff court. If the sheriff court is not round the corner in any town, it will be no more than 10 or 15 miles' journey to go and argue one's case. That is a substantial cost as well as a substantial inhibition. The argument about the formality of the sheriff court is struck at by the difficulties of having to make long journeys and going to foreign or strange parts of the country to argue one's case before a rent assessment committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my honourable Friend agree that rent assessment committees, as well as perceived as being physically less accessible than, for instance, the sheriff courts, are also judged by many to be considerably harsher in their dealings with tenants than the rent officers? Indeed, in places like Edinburgh, tenants are actively discouraged from going to rent assessment committees, because often they impose even higher rents than the landlord is asking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that that is true. That is a helpful intervention which illustrates and underlines my point. I hope that, for all those reasons, the Minister will look carefully at this again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was asked earlier what advice could be given, Not only citizens' advice bureaux, but Shelter and other voluntary organisations give advice on this matter. I mentioned that it was a Labour Government who set up the rent assessment committees in their present form. The Bill does not change in any respect the legal representations under these provisions. I mentioned earlier that I accept that there will be requirements for extra staff. The point raised by the honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) about accessibility must be kept under review.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. HomeRobertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was an awful reply. The rent assessment committees, as we have established, have the job principally of dealing with property valuation, not of considering the terms and conditions of tenancy. Being close to the citizens' advice bureaux in my constituency, I can tell the Minister that they and other voluntary organisations, including Shelter, are a little fed up with Ministers directing people to go to voluntary organisations to deal with the problems which the Ministers themselves have created. The amendment may not be the ideal way of dealing with the problem, but we, and Shelter, and other people in Scotland, have made our feelings on this subject well known. We expect the Minister to look at this issue again, and we may well wish to return to it on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is keen to throw the onus on to voluntary organisations like Shelter and the CAB, which have a difficult enough existence. Given the nature of the Bill, and of the service that we are discussing, will the Minister consider the terms of paragraph 2(2)(e)? We discussed the provision of assistance and advisory and other services and facilities which Scottish Homes will be entitled to provide. Will the Minister consider encouraging Scottish Homes to set up a representation service to ensure that tenants are properly advised? That would be in line with the obligations of Scottish Homes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a constructive suggestion. I will give way to the Minister if he wishes to reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So far as I know, the honourable and learned Member for Perth and Kinross is not yet a Minister, although we live in hope.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The provision relates much more to the advice given to tenants in the public sector and tenants of Scottish Homes and in relation to part III of the Bill. If specific questions are asked by private tenants, they may be answered, but the advisory service specified earlier in the Bill relates to public sector tenants and those who may wish to transfer to another landlord under part III of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 2(2)(e), to which my honourable Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) referred, states that Scottish Homes may
	<br><blockquote><p>"provide or assist in the provision of advisory or other services or facilities for any person".</p></blockquote>
That relates to the general functions of Scottish Homes which cover almost every aspect of housing, including tenants' interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is my duty to give the honourable Gentleman an opportunity to read the Bill. He was trying to do so while speaking. I see that he has dropped the Bill now that he has sat down.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These amendments would redress the balance of the Bill which, as drafted supports the stronger partner in the agreement—the landlord.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 255 would ensure that no undue pressure is put on tenants while the rent assessment committee is making a decision on a fair rent level. Deletion of the phrase covering a possible separate agreement between landlord and tenant would protect the tenant from any undue influence, however mild, to reach an agreement that may in the long term be unfavourable to the tenant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 157 would provide the rent assessment committee with discretion to continue its determination if they suspect that the tenant has been subject to undue pressure from the landlord to discontinue the application to the rent assessment committee. That would reverse the balance which is currently in favour of the landlord.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 231 covers the way in which an agreement may be reached without referral to the rent assessment committee. The provision needs to be clarified to ensure that the landlord cannot unduly persuade the tenant to contract out of the provisions on referral of the matter to the rent assessment committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 257 would provide another safeguard for tenants. Shelter has advised us that the amendment would protect the groups about which it is especially concerned and that it is desirable for any notice to be witnessed and signed in the presence of a notary public. That would ensure that neither party is coerced into withdrawing any referral made to the rent assessment committee. It would also guard against the possibility of false signatures or a tenant being duped into signing something that he does not fully understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The drift of the amendments is to provide tenants with the protection that the Bill as drafted does not enforce. I hope that the Minister will accept the force of the argument for ensuring that the balance is not tipped in favour of the landlord. The amendments would redress the balance and provide safeguards for tenants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a notary public, I declare an interest, but at the same time I encourage the Committee to accept amendment No. 257.I promise that I shall not make any extra money from the amendment if it is accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my honourable Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths) said, our intention is to introduce a little formality into the system. The Government rejected the proposal that the sheriff court rather than the rent assessment committee should deal with these matters and it is important to study the procedures to ensure that proper protection is provided. Those of us who have experience of some landlords who like to exploit the system—of the type that we seem to spend a great deal of time discussing—are seriously concerned about the rights and interests of tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments do not recommend a great formality, nor a great imposition on landlords or
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>638</span>
tenants. Most reasonable landlords use an agent, who is sometimes a solicitor, and most solicitors in Scotland tend to be notaries public because of the requirements for affidavits, for example. Therefore, there would be no difficulty in complying with this measure by bringing a tenant to an office and having the process explained to him by a member of the Law Society of Scotland, all of whom are reasonable men as my honourable Friends know, to ensure that the matter is properly notarised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That would provide a small step of formality that would afford the tenant protection. We are not asking for a great deal and the amendment would add little in the way of cost. If a tenant were given a copy of the letter and had to arrange to have it notarised, I understand that the cost would be covered under the present scheme for providing legal advice and assistance, so there would be no great impositioin on either side.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths) spoke of the need to keep a balance between the rights of tenants and landlords and to ensure the necessary protection. However, the amendments go against the basic philosophy underlying the Bill—that is, to open up the private rented market by leaving the negotiation of the terms of a tenancy to the good sense of landlords and tenants themselves in the first instance, and to do so with a minimum of legal formality, we recognise that, at some points during the currency of a tenancy, it is reasonable to allow the landlord or the tenant to appeal to an arbiter—the rent assessment committee. This is appropriate when for example, the landlord has issued a notice to quit but the tenant has exercised his right to remain in the house on a statutory assured tenancy. In those circumstances, it seems right, that changes to the terms of the tenancy should be possible and that when landlord and tenant cannot agree they should be able to ask the rent assessment committee to reach an equitable determination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it is quite possible that after having referred a matter to the rent assessment committee the landlord and tenant might reach an amicable agreement before the committee has reached its determination. In those circumstances, it would clearly be a waste of time for the committee to continue with its determination. I know that Opposition Members want to make decisions of the rent assessment committee binding but I suggest that we should have respect for the intelligence and good sense of tenants and landlords to come to an agreement. Amendment No. 157 would force a rent assessment committee to continue with a determination even if neither the landlord nor the tenant wanted it. Incidentally, I would stress that a rent assessment committee can abandon a determination only if both the landlord and the tenant agree and say so in writing. To pass amendment No. 157 would, therefore, lead to a waste of time and money and set up a power to interfere with freely negotiated leases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 231 and 255 are even more extraordinary. They would prevent a landlord and a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0430">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>639</span>
tenant from reaching an amicable agreement to change the terms of the tenancy unless they went through the procedure set out in the Bill which is designed to deal with cases where some agreement is lacking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Aberdeen, South spoke to amendment No. 257 and I have considered it with some care. I understand that its purpose is to ensure that the tenant, and perhaps even the landlord, have both freely agreed not to pursue the referral to the rent assessment committee. Apart from introducing an unnecessary legal complication, I am unable to see what the amendment would achieve in practice. If, for example, as I suppose Opposition Members might be imagining, the tenant has been forced by threats or some other duress to agree to withdraw his referral, the fact that he is brought before a lawyer to sign his agreement would make virtually no difference. After all, if he has already given way to improper pressures, what difference would it make if a lawyer were present?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Do Opposition Members believe that in the presence of the notary the tenants will find the courage to reveal that he does not really want to withdraw his referral? If he is being threatened, the threat will remain wherever the signing is done. The Bill strengthens the law against harassment and illegal eviction. The amendment would introduce an undesirable aura of legal formality into what should be a simple, quick and relatively informal procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's rationale for the clause is unconvincing. It is sad that the Government have decided to strip away the legal protections that have existed hitherto. Such safeguards were established because our worst fears about private landlords held by Labour Members, erstwhile one-nation Conservatives and Liberals were being realised. The Minister is seeking to turn back the clock to the time when the balance was in favour of private landlords. We wish to move forward. The Minister should not blame the rent Acts or the tenants for the decline in housing under private landlords. That was inevitable, just as it was inevitable that councils had to take the responsibility for clearing the many slums that were created by private landlords, particularly in the 19th century.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sufficient safeguards have been written into the Bill. The rent assessment committee must continue a determination when a case has been referred to it unless both the landlord and the tenant agree that they no longer want the committee's opinion in the matter. The tenant does not have to withdraw his referral if he does not so wish. I am convinced that the best method of settling the terms of a tenancy is free negotiation between landlord and tenant.

Clause 17 is an inevitable consequence of the establishment of the assured tenancy principle. I suppose that we should be thankful for small mercies in that it establishes certain limited rights for people who have been in assured tenancies and who want to carry on within some kind of legal framework. We remain totally opposed to the principle of assured tenancies. We do not like the statutory assured tenancy, which is a limbo that follows the termination of the assured tenancy. These provisions are a slight mitigation of the evil of the assured tenancy system, so I do not intend to divide the Committee on clause stand part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 17 caters for the situation when a contractual assured tenancy is succeeded by a statutory assured tenancy, as provided by clause 16, and the landlord or tenant wishes to vary certain terms of the tenancy other than rent. "Certain terms" can include the length of the let, the responsibility for repairs, the upkeep of common ground and other matters of that nature. Once a

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>641</span>
contractual tenancy has been brought to an end by the serving of a notice to quit and a statutory tenancy arises in its place, it is only fair that the landlord and tenant should each have the right to review the new situation and to propose a change in the terms of the tenancy. It is fair because circumstances change with the passage of time and the parties to a contract should have the chance to reassess their relationship once the contract terminated. If the landlord and tenant cannot agree new terms, each party will have the right to refer the case to the rent assessment committee for adjudication.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At any time within the first year of a statutory assured tenancy, the landlord or tenant will be able to seek a change in the terms of the tenancy by giving the other party notice of the proposed change. The form of the notice will be prescribed by the Secretary of State in regulations. If the party receiving the notice does not accept the proposed change, he will be able to refer the notice to the rent assessment committee. That reference will have to be made within one month of receipt of the notice. Otherwise, the proposed new terms will take effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been listening carefully to the Minister. Is any machinery available to enable him to monitor the extent of any changes made under the provisions of the clause?

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rent assessment committee will adjudicate by considering whether the proposed new terms are reasonable. The terms decided by the committee will come into effect from the date that the committee directs that the landlord and tenant will always be free to agree different terms or different date for the change in terms if they so wish. I should emphasise that clause 17 refers to changes in terms other than rent. Changes in the rent payable for statutory assured tenancies are dealt with by later clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>ORDERS FOR POSSESSION</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 407, in clause 18, page 11, line 46, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(a) Where the interest of the landlord belongs to a registered housing association, the landlord may raise the proceedings for recovery of possession of the house only in accordance with sections 47 to 51 and on the grounds specified in Schedule 3 to the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 and references in that Act to a secure tenancy are, for the purposes of this section, references to an assured tenancy under which the interest of the landlord belongs to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>642</span>
a registered housing association, and in such cases, sections 19 and 20 of this Act shall not apply.".</p></blockquote>
This amendment has been suggested by the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations. Clause 18 deals with orders for possession, which is a polite way of describing orders for eviction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to determine a procedure by which a registered housing association may seek an order for possession of a house let on an assured tenancy. The housing association movement is not happy about the principle of assured tenancies. The procedure by which a registered housing association as landlord may seek recovery of possession of a house let on a secure tenancy is set out in sections 47 and 51 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987. The grounds on which recovery of possession may—I stress the word "may"—be granted are listed in schedule 3 to that Act. In all cases those grounds are subject to the test of reasonableness and eight of them are additionally subject to the availability of suitable alternative accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill provides 17 grounds for possession in schedule 5, 11 of which are mandatory and do not allow for the sheriffs discretion. Two of those mandatory grounds relate to rent arrears, a problem which, in the experience of housing associations, needs to be dealt with sensitively and with discretion. The amendment would enable that practice to continue. In all other cases under the existing legislation, a landlord is required to serve a notice on the tenant with a minimum period of four weeks, specifying the grounds on which possession is sought. Under the Bill, that procedure will not apply equally to all cases. The period of notice may be two weeks or two months or it may be dispensed with altogether.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is expected that investors, who have participated in the funding of housing association projects, will mainly be looking for a return in terms of capital generated revenue through rents rather than realisation of the capital assets. For that reason, the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations suggests that the retention of the existing provision for the security of tenure of housing association tenants will not be detrimental to the viability of housing association projects. It is most unlikely that housing associations will want vacant possession as part of their financial strategy and it is not desirable, from the point of view of the housing association movement, that there should be a mandatory provision for eviction in the housing association sector. The Minister has already acknowledged that there is a case for special treatment in the Bill for housing associations. This seems to be another such instance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The work of housing associations is invaluable in Scotland and their representations should be taken seriously. The amendment relates to future lettings on assured tenancies by registered housing associations. It seeks to subject such assured tenancies to different provisions as regards proceedings for possession from those which will apply to the generality of assured tenancies.

I gave undertakings during our deliberations on Tuesday that a wide range of matters relating to the rights of tenants under assured tenancies where the landlord is a registered housing association would be the subject of discussions between my officials and the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations and the Housing Corporation in Scotland. The subject matter of the amendment falls within the scope of those discussions. Since the committee has already accepted the need for the discussions to examine the rights of future housing association tenants more closely, I hope that the honourable Member will withdraw the amendment to allow the discussions to take place, consistent with the general accord within the Committee on Tuesday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is helpful. I wonder whether the Minister can suggest a time scale for those consultations. If the Bill is enacted in its present form, it will be a long time before we have another opportunity to amend it. We genuinely welcome the fact that the Government are in dialogue with the housing association movement. It is good to know that they are prepared to listen to someone. It seems likely, judging from what we have already been told by that movement, that it will ask for amendments to the legislation and this is the appropriate time to make them.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 18 must be set in the context of the Government's aim of encouraging the private sector. They made their views clear in the explanatory notes to the Bill which state that the major explanation for the decline in the private sector in Scotland over the past 30 years lies in the statutory controls under which private landlords have been obliged to operate. The statutory controls include the existing provisions for security of tenure which are set out in the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984, including the grounds on which a court must or may grant an order for possession to landlords. Clause 18 deals with those orders and relates them to schedule 5 to the Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments seek to show that the new grounds in the Bill for granting orders of possession to landlords represent a serious and significant weakening of the tenants' position. For example, the mandatory grounds for possession, when proven in court, must result in the making of a possession order. In other words, when a sheriff cannot exercise any discretion under the Bill, the first ground for such possession is that suitable alternative accommodation is available for the tenant or will be available for him when the order for possession take effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the ground is implemented through the sheriff court the tenant is faced with an almost impossible choice. The tenant must accept the alternative accommodation, whether or not it suits him—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it is suitable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I tried to explain to the honourable and learned Gentleman earlier, "suitable" is not wide enough for the sheriff to ensure that the accommodation offered will suit the needs of the tenant. The honourable and learned Gentleman earlier compared an area in the centre of Glasgow with Black hill. I pointed out that if Black hill is suitable for the tenants who live there, it must be suitable for any tenant living any where esle. It would not be up to the sheriff to find otherwise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the greatest respect, the honourable Gentleman made a very bad analogy. He made the very good analogy of his own family. It would be inequitable to suggest that it was suitable for a person to be placed in Black hill with a travel-to-work time and cost totally different from where he lived before. That would not be suitable. The amendment is extraordinary because it assumes that sheriffs do not take just and equitable decisions in all circumstances. They have to interpret the order for possession as being just and equitable before they can say that accommodation is suitable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The sheriff can operate only within the law as it exists. Our objection is that the word "suitable" would not give the sheriff wide enough discretion to ensure that possession was "just and equitable".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable and learned Member for Perth and Kinross mentioned the criterion of travelling time to work. The honourable and learned Gentleman knows
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0433">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>645</span>
that many tenants not so affected, either because they are unemployed and on supplementary benefit or because they are retired. Many tenants would have to accept alternative accommodation that might not be suitable or lose their right to accommodation altogether. Clause 18(1) provides that the sheriff must make an order for possession when one of the mandatory grounds is proven. Any ground would be sufficient for such an order to be made. Even model tenants could be faced with the impossible choice of being evicted or having to move to unsuitable accommodation in an area that was not liked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 18(1) effectively provides that the sheriff should make an order when a ground is proven in court and that he has no discretion. That is to be compared with what happens under section 11 of the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984 which says that the court should grant an order for possession only when it considers it reasonable to do so and when it is satisfied either that suitable alternative accommodation is available for the tenant or that one of the grounds under the schedule to the 1984 Act applies. The crucial and key phrase is "considers it reasonable". That is what is missing from clause 18. Under the Bill, it would not matter whether the sheriff thought it reasonable. If it was proven that suitable alternative accommodation was available, out would go the tenant. That represents a significant weakening of security of tenure. The only rationale that I can find for that is that it is one of the carrots that the Minister is dangling in front of private landlords to try to attract them back into the rented sector and to invest in providing rented accommodation. He is offering them the unchallenged right to evict tenants who have done nothing wrong. That is the only interpretation that can be put on clause 18.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 259 seeks to prohibit a sheriff making a possession order unless he considers it just and equitable. That would restore to tenants' rights that they currently enjoy and would also allow courts to be flexible and treat each case individually on its merits, including consideration of the likely hardship to tenants of having to move to other accommodation as well as taking account of the interests of the landlord.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ground 3 provides for the making of a possession order in cases where the landlord has defaulted on a mortgage or other loan, enabling the landlord to sell the property with vacant possession. If that ground is applied arbitrarily—as it would be under clause 18—it would give unscruplous landlords a simple mechanism for realising the value of their property. Housing aid workers know from experience that landlord companies are often subsidiaries of larger companies, and that landlord companies have often obtained the necessary mortgages to buy properties from larger sister companies. Should such a smaller company wish to realise the value of its property, it need only default on its loan to set in motion a process for obtaining vacant possession, thus giving the property a higher value than if it was sold with a sitting tenant. That is a charter for abuse by
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>646</span>
unscrupulous landlords. The Minister should look closely at the implications of a landlord company acting as the subsidiary of a larger sister company. The most important aspect is that tenants who have done nothing wrong, paid the rent on the dot and not broken their contractual obligations, will find themselves out of their property because of the machinations of a subsidiary company with a larger sister company in trying to achieve possession of the property. If the Minister is a fair man, he will consider that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to oblige the sheriff to grant possession only if he considers it to be just and equitable. That would enable the court to consider the relative merits of granting a landlord vacant possession or making an otherwise examplary tenant homeless. I recently wrote to the Minister about a case in Dundee. A young lady, who was a model tenant, had rented property from a landlord who had failed to keep up the mortgage payments on the property. The young lady was faced with being thrown out on the streets in Dundee. The Minister replied that if the young lady had a contract, she would be protected under existing legislation. But the existing legislation offers protection to model tenants in such circumstances only if they have a written lease. Schedule 11 provides that where a landlord is in default on a mortgage the sheriff may grant an order for possession if the landlord requires vacant possession of the property only if the court is of the opinion that it is just and equitable to do so in those circumstances. Protection exists for model tenants trapped in that sort of situation. But if the Bill is unamended, that protection will be taken away. The Minister should look closely at the wording.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ground 11 provides for the making of a possession order in cases where the tenant has persistently delayed paying rent. I tried to elicit from the Minister this morning how he would define "persistently". In theory, paying one day late for three months could be defined as persistently delaying the payment of rent. If that was proven in the sheriff court, the sheriff would have no option but to say that the tenant was guilty and that the landlord should be granted possession. To ensure that possession orders are granted only where landlords have a genuine grievance against tenants and where landlords are likely to suffer significant hardship when weighed against the hardships caused to tenants being obliged to leave their homes, the Minister should concede amendment No. 259. Then sheriffs would have discretion to refuse possession because it would be unjust and inequitable. As the clause stands, the sheriff would be obliged to find in favour of landlords in all those circumstances and model tenants would find themselves discriminated against and thrown out into the streets or into an area where they did not want to live because the Minister had tilted the balance away from tenants and back towards landlords. In the case of good respectable landlords, that may be all right but not all landlords are good and respectable. People in every city in Scotland will be ready to exploit the clause to the full and to make the tenants suffer. It is up to the Minister to respond and to concede the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to the honourable Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion). My honourable and learned Friend the Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn) made a valid point about amendment No. 259 when he said a sheriff should always act justly and equitably. The amendment is not expressed in the right terms to achieve what the Opposition want. If the sheriff acting justly and equitably means, as I think that it does, that he must always act in accordance with the law and as fairly between the parties as the law allows, I would expect him to do so automatically. I suggest that amendment No. 259 would add nothing to clause 18. However, I have taken note of what the honourable Gentleman said about the particular grounds listed in the amendment and I shall bear them in mind when we come to look at the individual grounds in schedule 5.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intention of amendments Nos. 364 to 366 is similar—a wish to ensure that the sheriff can use his discretion when dealing with applications for possession. I am prepared carefully to consider the arguments when we reach schedule 5, when I hope that the fears of Opposition Members will be somewhat allayed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister has referred to amendments Nos. 364, 365 and 366, will he also bear in mind the difficulties that are likely to be experienced by local authorities? If sheriffs grant possession at the drop of a hat under this legislation, the buck always stops with local authorities under the Government and they will have the job of housing those who lose their homes under the provisions of the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act 1977. However, it will be difficult for them to do so if they are given no notice. I hope that he will take that into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The effect of the provisions will be to operate in the other way. They will greatly expand the private rented market to bring many more—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You do not believe that!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly do. They will bring many more houses back into operation, and in areas where they are common rent levels are likely to reduce because those who let property will want to find clients for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When a landlord has a mandatory right to repossession, it should not be possible for a sheriff to reduce it by exercising his discretion to adjourn the proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, amendment No. 363 seeks to remove the discretion of the court to waive the requirement for a notice on ground 10 of the schedule, which is three months' arrears of rent, and on ground 11, which is persistent delay in paying the rent. I am well aware of the argument, which was advanced forcefully by the honourable Member for Dundee, East, that there are circumstances in which a tenant may persistently delay paying rent through no fault of his or her own.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept much of what Opposition Members have said in this connection but I do not think that, for the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>648</span>
general reasons that I outlined, the correct way forward is to restrict the discretion of the court. In that regard, I am firmly persuaded that the more discretion a court has, the more likely it is that the outcome will be fair to both parties. I have carefully noted what Opposition Members said about ground 11, but the best time to consider that matter is when we come to debate schedule 5.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am intrigued by the Minister's last remark. The honourable Gentleman did not allow me to intervene when he was talking about homeless tenants in response to an intervention by my honourable Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson), but I had wanted to ask him what sort of landlord would want to house a tenant who had just been evicted. We are discussing investment in private housing and, we hope, the improvement of the lot of tenants in Scotland. The Opposition believe that that is the last thing that will happen because housing will be run as a business by most landlords, and that is what the Government want. In the Minister's version of events, housing availability will be improved by bringing more private housing on to the market, but if that housing is run as a business, such tenants will not be picked up by the private sector. The onus will be pushed straight on to local authorities, which are under-resourced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A bank would not give a loan to someone who had just defaulted on a loan from another bank, nor would a building society in similar circumstances. Therefore, I do not see what justification the Minister has for assuming that private landlords, who are in the game to make money, will not act in the same way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was intrigued also by the Minister's remark that the way forward is not to restrict the discretion of the courts because that is exactly what the Bill will do. Under section 11(1) of the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984, the courts have discretion. Section 11(1) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"a court shall not make an order for possession of a dwelling-house which is for the time being let on a protected tenancy or subject to a statutory tenancy unless the court considers it reasonable to make such an order".</p></blockquote>
Therefore, it is clear that courts have discretion and, from my experience, I know that they exercise it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, if evidence is presented to show that a landlord has been difficult by harassing a tenant or putting obstacles in his way, the courts can exercise discretion. When we move into the new era of assured tenancies, the sheriff will not have that discretion under clause 18 in relation to the important area of part I of schedule 5. It is specious of the Minister to suggest that the way forward is not to restrict the discretion of the courts because that is exactly what he is doing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman asked what would happen to a tenant who, through misfortune, finds himself without a home and wishes to be rehoused. I envisage that the housing association movement would play a key role in that regard. It caters for a great many people in Scotland who fall into the category of special interest groups and I envisage a rapid expansion of that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0435">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>649</span>
movement. Obviously, the circumstances will depend on what has happened but if a tenant, through no fault of his or her own, has the misfortune to be without a home I should expect the housing association movement to take the circumstances into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a constituent who rented some excellent, magnificent flats in Dundee to people on comparatively circumscribed incomes. Thanks to their ability to take advantage by getting their rents reduced, he has had to sell those flats because he cannot afford to let them to the very people who were in trust with him as his tenants. That is the position at present and it is wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had hoped that we were drawing the debate to a conclusion but, again, the Minister has showed his uncertainty and lack of knowledge of the Scottish housing scene. When he responded to my honourable Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson), he said that new opportunities would be available for the private sector to house homeless tenants, but when he was pressed on the point the onus was switched to the housing association movement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a supporter of the housing association movement and of greater flexibility in housing. I also have a certain sympathy with the position of the landlord described by the honourable and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn). I shall not pretend that every landlord is out to make pots of money, but I know of some who are, and they tend to be unscrupulous. They are the people about whom we are most worried. I have sympathy with honest landlords who own a few flats and have difficulty in finding the capital to upgrade and modernise them because they cannot obtain decent rents for them. That should be investigated, but the Minister is skirting around the problem by jumping from area to area with references to the housing association movement and private tenants. We need certainty, but that is what is lacking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier, we had a great amount of debate on statistics which we found questionable, to say the least. With the greatest respect, I find it difficult to take the Minister's remarks seriously as he is not clear about what might happen. Within the space of a few minutes he jumped around in various directions but failed to home in on the points that we made. It is all very well for him to read from a brief, but we want serious answers to serious questions and we are not getting them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us be quite clear about this. Of course the housing associations will have a key role to play. The honourable Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) asked about a tenant who is evicted. Schedule 5 gives the discretionary grounds for repossession. With the exception of one, they all relate to circumstances in which the tenant is at fault. If a tenant was at fault,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>650</span>
that would not make it easy for him to be taken on by another private landlord as the honourable Gentleman suggested, but if the ground for repossession is that the landlord has returned from overseas to his only house, there is no reason why his tenant could not reapply to another private landlord and be accepted. That would apply to both private housing and the housing association movement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that the honourable Member for Aberdeen, South wishes to discuss the grounds, but we shall be able to do that thoroughly in the debate on schedule 5.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am unhappy with the answers given by the Minister and especially with his reference to the housing associations picking up tenants who are evicted from rented accommodation through no fault of their own. Mandatory grounds 1 and 3 will enable perfectly honest tenants to be turned out on to the streets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Dundee, there are 38,000 council houses, some of which are empty. There are only just over 2,000 housing association houses, and they are not empty. There are long lists of people who want to get into those houses. The associations will thus be incapable of picking up tenants who are evicted, so the tenants will be thrown back on to the district council. Every district council in every major city has "difficult to let" areas, and tenants often went to the private rented sector to escape from such property in the first place. They will now be evicted throught no fault of their own and driven back to the difficult to let estates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the Minister's argument, and it does not hold water. My honourable Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) was right. The Minister is restricting the discretion available to the sheriff under the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984, which allows him to decide whether a case is "reasonable". This Bill spells out in part III of schedule 5 what is meant by "suitable alternative accommodation", and the sheriff has to accept that definition when the district council presents a certificate offering suitable alternative accommodation. If the council does offer suitable accommodation, the sheriff will have to grant the possession order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other conditions can be imposed, such as whether the property is close to the tenant's work. Many tenants do not work, however, so that criterion does not always apply. After that the only conditions that need be established are whether the rent is similar, whether the property is of sufficient size and whether it is furnished, if the property that the tenant is leaving is furnished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is allowing landlords to exploit tenants and drive them into parts of the city that they have been trying to escape from, and doing nothing about it. The Bill may be a carrot to bring good landlords in, but it will be an even bigger carrot to bad landlords who will exploit tenants. The Minister should wake up to that fact. I shall certainly not withdraw my amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would have the effect of increasing a tenant's security by removing all the mandatory grounds for eviction where serious hardship would be caused to the tenant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government may feel that the amendment goes too far, and of course I understand that in many cases the principle could be breached—for example, where the landlord himself might become homeless. However, I suggest that in general the discretion should always work to the tenant's advantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 310 would ensure that the sheriff was made aware of the circumstances of the tenant and his household, and take those circumstances into account before giving any order for possession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>652</span>
I see amendments Nos. 240 and 241 as the most important in the group. They would make ground 1, the availability of suitable alternative accommodation, a discretionary and not a mandatory ground for the repossession of an assured tenancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand from those of my honourable Friends who are serving on the Committee examining the English Housing Bill that the Government have made an extremely important concession and have accepted that the availability of suitable alternative accommodation should be a discretionary and not a mandatory ground for eviction. It would be intolerable if tenants were to be given that degree of additional protection in England and not in Scotland. We shall insist that the Government give positive consideration to the discrepancy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman is trying to distinguish between Scottish and English legislation, but I notice in his amendments Nos. 309 and 310, that the words that the honourable Gentleman wishes to insert are
	<br><blockquote><p>"if he is satisfied that it would not cause undue hardship to the tenant or to any of his dependants"</p></blockquote>
whereas amendment No. 310 has regard to
	<br><blockquote><p>"the tenant and any of his dependants who may reside in the accommodation with him."</p></blockquote>
Am I to understand that under Amendment No. 309 if a cousin or a nephew or a visiting aunt were to be inconvenienced, the sheriff would have to take that into consideration but that under amendment No. 310 he must do so only if they happen to be resident in the property? If the honourable Gentleman seeks consistency between Scottish and English legislation he should also be consistent in his amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I dealt briefly with amendments Nos. 309 and 310. At this stage, I am concentrating my remarks on amendments No. 240 and 241 and whether ground 1 for eviction under schedule 5 should be mandatory or discretionary. I hope that the honourable and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn) will bear with me on this very important point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that representations have been made to all members of the Committee by bodies interested in housing in Scotland, and in particular by Shelter—Scotland and the Scottish Council for the Single Homeless which are extremely worried that a large number of evictions will take place under ground 1. It will be easy for landlords of the type that we are discussing to say that they are offering suitable alternative accommodation, but whether it is suitable may be highly debatable. The fact that the accommodation has been offered at all will be a mandatory ground for eviction under the Bill as drafted. We are suggesting that it should be made discretionary, allowing the sheriff to judge whether, in all the circumstances of the case, it is appropriate to grant possession on ground 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, I understand that the Department of the Environment and the Standing Committee examining the English legislation have accepted the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0437">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>653</span>
argument, so there is an overwhelming case for making a similar amendment to this Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am serious about this matter because it is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I or the honourable Gentleman were put out of my house and I had to go and stay with my sister, under amendment No. 309 I could argue that it would cause hardship to my dependant, whatever a "dependant" is, but to put another person and his children out of the same house involves quite another issue of principle. The amendments seem to contradict each other. The question of whether a tenant, and his children and mother-in-law and whoever else lives in the house are put out is one matter—the question of whether it would inconvenience other members of the family if the tenant had to go and stay with them after being put out of his own house is quite different.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the honourable and learned Gentleman's point. These are probing amendments designed to make it possible for the sheriff to take into account at least the circumstances of the family. There might, for example, be a disabled child in a family and eviction in that case would be particularly appalling. I am not standing by every jot and detail of the two amendments—they are probing amendments whereby we seek proper consideration of the interests of the individual members of households which might be faced with eviction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to ground 1 in schedule 5 about the availability of alternative accommodation and wonder whether that should be a mandatory ground for eviction. The court would have to order possession when
	<br><blockquote><p>"suitable alternative accommodation is available for the tenant"</p></blockquote>
regardless of the merits of the individual case. Under the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984, the court can order possession of a statutory or protective tenancy on the ground that suitable alternative accommodation is available to the tenant only if the court is satisfied at the same time it would be reasonable to order possession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Bill, the court find alternative accommodation that is suitable, as defined by schedule 5, part III, and which is available to the tenant for ground 1 to be satisfied. However, the tenant may feel that it is unreasonable to have to move from his current home for a range of reasons that can be imagined by the Committee. Amendments Nos. 240 and 241 would ensure that private tenants and assured tenancies continue to have the protection of the test of reasonableness that is afforded to protected and statutory tenants. That would maintain the status quo in private rented sector legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a crucially important part of the legislation. What could be more important to a family than whether they remain in their house or face the prospect of eviction because an alternative hovel is made available to them? We understand that those
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>654</span>
discussing the English Housing Bill have accepted the principle of the amendment. I appeal to the Minister and the Committee to extend that principle to Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise that honourable Members feel strongly that the sheriff should have discretion when proceedings for possession are brought on one of the mandatory grounds and amendment No. 309 seeks to provide that. However, there is another side to the story. It is essential that if we are to make better use of empty accommodation in Scotland, we must encourage as many people to let as possible. Many potential landlords are dissuaded from letting their property because they fear that they will not be able to get it back when they need it. It is to reassure such people that we decided that some of the grounds for repossession should be mandatory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be grateful if the Minister will explain the mentality of someone who prefers to keep a house empty on the pretext that he will be unable to repossess it. What is the point of having property just to keep it empty?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can explain that easily. I referred earlier to a civil engineer, for example, who may have a job for a year or so in the middle east. When he returns, he will want repossession of his only house.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have another example. If someone lets a cottage to a tenant who proves to be unsatisfactory, the effort of trying to get him to leave is enormous, even if that cottage is required for, say, an agricultural worker.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the example given by my honourable and learned Friend the Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn). We are trying to seek a balance between the rights of tenants and landlords. We are considering whether some of the currently mandatory grounds should be made discretionary. We shall discuss that when we read schedule 5.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On amendment No. 310, I recognise the anxiety of the honourable Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson). I can reassure the Committee that the sheriff will consider the tenant's views when deciding whether possession is reasonable on one of the discretionary grounds, so the first part of amendment No. 310 is unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the second part, I do not agree with what it seeks to do. I understand the desire to prevent eviction if it leads to homelessness, but all but one of the discretionary grounds for possession refer to instances when the tenant has misbehaved. If the sheriff believes that a landlord has a reasonable case for evicting a bad tenant—whatever Opposition Members may think, there are bad tenants as well as bad landlords—that landlord should not be forced to continue to house the tenant just because suitable alternative accommodation cannot be found.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 240, 241, 418 and 270are all intended to impose a test of reasonableness on the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0438">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>655</span>
making of an order for possession under ground 1 of schedule 5, either by textual amendment or by moving that ground to part II of the schedule. It may help the Committee if I say how my mind is working on the question of allowing the sheriff discretion on some of the mandatory grounds involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been struck by the strength of feeling in the Committee that the balance in schedule 5 goes too far in favour of the landlord. I am considering urgently how best to introduce an element of discretion or reasonableness where it can be justified. The grounds that seem to be the most promising candidates for modification are ground 1, to which the group of amendments refer, and ground 11, about persistent rent arrears, to which the honourable Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) referred at length. I am not convinced that there is a need for change to the other grounds referred to in schedule 5, but I shall continue to listen to the debates with an open mind. If the honourable Member for East Lothian will agree not to press amendments Nos. 240, 241 and 270, I undertake to offer proposals on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot be so encouraging about amendment No. 396. Ground 8 contains safeguards for the tenant. The demolition or mamor redevelopment that the landlord will carry out must be genuine and established as such to the satisfaction of the sheriff. That ground will not apply to a landlord who has acquired his interest after the beginning of the tenancy. A tenant's house will not be sold over his head. The ground will apply only if it is impossible for the tenant to remain in the house while the work takes place. The practical objection to the amendment tabled by the honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) is that a landlord may not have alternative accommodation to offer a tenant. It is unlikely that large landlord companies will be involved, so it would be wrong to prevent a landlord from carrying out improvements to his property that would increase the standard of accommodation available. The Bill is about improving rented accommodation, so it would be perverse to erect such barriers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We never expect the Minister to be perverse, although some of his colleagues may be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is it the Government's intention to table an amendment on Report that would alter the status of grounds 1 and 11 of the schedule from mandatory to discretionary grounds?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the essence of what I said when I undertook to consider urgently how best to introduce the element of discretion or reasonableness where it can be justified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a significant step in the right direction. I see that the Minister is indicating assent having consulted his advisers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his giving way on grounds 1 and 11. I am not being difficult, but I appeal to him to reconsider ground 3,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>656</span>
too. There are legitimate cases of landlords facing difficulties when trying to gain possession of their houses when they come back from abroad, for example. But will the Minister consider when a subsidiary landlord company takes out its mortgage from the larger company and then defaults? It is legal fiction because both organisation are, in reality, one company, although, technically, they may not be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ground 3 could be abused by such sharp operators and work against tenants' interests. We must ensure that tenants are not exploited in that way as well as protecting the repossession rights of genuine landlords. I am sure that the sheriff would use his discretion in such matters. It is important that he is able to do so under ground 3.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall debate each ground when we reach schedule 5.I am aware of the honourable Gentleman's constituency case to which he referred earlier. We must achieve a balance between the rights of the tenant and those of the landlord. I do not wish to go any further that what I have already said this evening.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Therefore, the Minister is not closing the door.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly not. We shall consider each ground on its merits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My honourable Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) can rest assured that we shall have ample opportunity to debate fully each ground. Indeed, the next amendment to which my honourable Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths) will speak refers to ground 3. Nevertheless, we have received significant concessions from the Minister on grounds 1 and 11 that deal with the availability of suitable alternative accommodation, and rent arrears.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be outrageous if a mandatory requirement were placed on a court to evict tenants in circumstances where such grounds apply. Such a provision would have been intolerable and we would have made a great issue of it. I am glad that the Government have seen the error of their ways at such an early stage in our proceedings. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 260, in page 12, line 12, leave out from 'tenancy' in line 12 to end of line 17.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a complicated matter. The amendment would require the service of a notice to quit under section 112 of the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984 to terminate all contractual assured tenancies. Subsection (6)(a) of the Bill allows the sheriff to grant a possession order, without a notice to quit having been issued on grounds 3, 10 or 11 under part 1 of schedule 5, or on any of the discretionary grounds, except where a house is let as a consequence of employment under ground 17.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0439">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>657</span>
There has long been an acceptance in Scottish law that notice to quit is necessary before court action to remove a tenant from heritable property is taken. The amendment would ensure that that fairly long-established principle remains a legal requirement. An assured tenancy can only become a statutory assured tenancy on the termination of the contractual tenancy. The contractual tenancy can be terminated only by the issue of a valid notice to quit by either party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even when the lease stipulates a fixed contractual period, the operation if tacit relocation recreates a contractual tenancy on the same terms including the fixed contractual period. I understand that that means that there is no automatic termination of a contractual tenancy after any specified period without deliberate action by the landlord or the tenant to prevent the operation of tacit relocation. To prevent the operation of tacit relocation the party wishing to bring a lease to an end before its natural term must give notice to the other party. Clause 18 (6)(a) would allow a possession order to be granted without a tenancy coming to an end and without the issue of a notice to quit. That would deprive tenants of a long-established right. Not only would it remove any requirement to give tenants four weeks' notice in all cases, but tenants would be given no details of their rights, which are currently contained in the notice to quit. The amendment would re-establish the right to be given specific details of those rights. I ask the Minister to consider the amendment in that light.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems that the honourable Gentleman does not appreciate the practical meaning and application of his own amendment. Notices to quit are not strictly relevant to the amendment. The purpose of the amendment is so nonsensical that it is hard to believe—because it indicates a conviction that tenants can do no wrong. Its effect, incredible though it may seem, is that a tenant could never be eviced from a house which he or she held on a contractual tenancy, whatever he or she did. It would not matter if the tenant did not pay the rent. In other words, if the tenant refused to keep the original side of the bargin, it would not make any difference. Those notions are bizarre and the people of Scotland should not be exposed to them. It is a wrecking amendment which should be rejected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of Order, Mr. Mabie. I am sure that you would not have selected a wrecking amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure, too, that Shelter Scotland, which suggested the amendment, would not do anything as daft as that.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a purely technical amendment which is designed to remove a possible doubt about the nature of the assured tenancy referred to in clause 18(7) as having arisen on the termination of a contractual tenancy. If a contractual tenancy has been terminated, a statutory assured tenacy arises automatically on that termination. This subsection is intended to provide that even if this happened the sheriff can still order possession of the House on grounds relating to the lease which has been terminated. This amendment simply makes it clear that that applies only if a statutory assured tenancy has arisen—not if there is a new contractual tenancy, in which case to order possession would clearly be absurd. I therefore commend the amendment to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We do not like clause 18, because we do not like the principle of eviction, although we acknowledge that there are circumstances in which such action can be justified. We shall have a further opportunity to debate the detailed aspects of schedule 5, and the Minister has given an important indication that the Government intend to make some radical amendments to schedule 5. That shows an almost unprecedented degree of open mindedness by the Scottish Office. In the hope that we can make further headway on schedule 5, I shall not seek to divide the Committee on the clause stand part, although we shall wish to debate some of its principles later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important clause and I should like to specify its provisions. The clause puts security on tenure in concrete form. An earlier clause—clause 16—provides that a landlord can repossess his house only by obtaining a court order, and clause 18 provides that a court order can be granted only on certain specified grounds. The grounds are listed in schedule 5, which we shall discuss presently. For the moment we are discussing clause 18, which explains how the grounds for possession are to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The grounds for possession are divided into two types, as they are in the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984. They are divided into mandatory grounds—the grounds on which the court must order possession—and discretionary grounds, on which the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0440">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>659</span>
court may order possession. There are 17 grounds in all: 11 mandatory and six discretionary. I should point out that the grounds are fewer than the cases or grounds in the 1984 Act. A landlord may seek possession on any one of the grounds—mandatory or discretionary—after a contractual assured tenancy is succeeded by a statutory assured tenancy: that is, after he terminates the contractual tenancy by serving a notice to quit. But during the period of the contractual tenancy, the landlord may seek possession only on one of three of the mandatory grounds and five of the discretionary grounds, and only if the terms of the tenancy explicitly allow the tenancy to be ended on the ground in question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the discretionary grounds, the sheriff is instructed not to make an order on any of these grounds unless he considers it reasonable to do so. If, therefore, the sheriff considers that an order for possession would be unfair to the tenant in some way, he will have discretion to refuse an order and allow the tenant to remain in the house. The same discretion is not available to the sheriff in considering an application for an order for possession on one of the mandatory grounds, but these grounds stand on their own and are to be invoked if certain facts are proved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It appears that the Minister was reading a brief that was prepared before he made some major and significant concessions on clause 18. I hope that the more hard-line approach in the brief will not be reflected in any amendments that he makes. We should not proceed without saying that we believe, given the spirit of the Minister's acceptance of a number of amendments, that the clause should not be enacted unamended. The Government have accepted, for the first time, the force of a significant number of arguments that we have made about the erosion of tenants' rights and the balance being tilted in favour of landlords.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 19 covers notice of proceedings for possession. Amendment No. 313 would remove from subsection (2) the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"but the grounds specified in such a notice may be altered or added to with the leave of the sheriff".</p></blockquote>
The amendment would remove the presumption in favour of the landlord. If the landlord genuinely believes that he has grounds for seeking possession, other than because he may be able to obtain a higher rent or a more advantageous lease with a new tenant, he should be able to specify those grounds in the original notice. What possible reason is there for allowing a landlord to submit new grounds for eviction at the court hearing? That will simply make it possible for a landlord to concoct any story without allowing the tenant time to prepare a case to refute it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 262 would ensure that a shereff does not give leave to alter or add to the ground specified in a notice of proceedings for possesion unless he is of the opinion that it is just and equitable to do so. The amendment would provide a right of appeal and, therefore, extend the principal of justice. Without the amendment, a sheriff could give leave to make alteration or add to the ground without the

Amendment No. 263 would require the notice of proceedings to conform to a standard form to be specified by the Secretary of State. That would be for the convenience of all concerned and would avoid unnecessary confusion.

Amendments Nos. 323 and 324 will be of interest to my honourable Friend the Member for Dundee, East. It covers ground 3 for possession when a property is to be sold vacant in order to settle a secured debt. I suggest that in no circumstances would a debtor landlord be justified in not giving notice to a protected tenant of the existence of the risk of repossession under those circumstances. If such circumstances arise, the landlord should be penalised, not the tenant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My honourable Friend the Member for Dundee, East referred to a case in his constituency. Someone had rented a property in the belief that the tenancy would be secure, and then discovered that the landlord had financial difficulties. The landlord's creditor dispossessed the tenant, who was penalised for something beyond her control. The amendment would oblige a landlord in such circumstances to notify a prospective tenant of the risk involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I sympathise with the intention behind many of the amendments. Of course, it is desirable that, whenever possible, a tenant has full notice of his landlord's intention to seek repossession of the house. Of course, it is true that having received that notice the tenant should, as a rule, be certain that no new matters will be raised. Absolutes are always difficult. Opposition Members have argued on various occasions that the court should be allowed to exercise discretion and to consider the reasonableness or otherwise of the ground of action and of the behaviour of the parties. Yet in this group of amendments, they seem to have fallen into a deep distrust of the very court to which they would look to protect the tenant in other circumstances. I therefore think that the general attitude that motivates these amendments is mistaken. Opposition Members must at least pay the sheriff the courtesy of supposing that he will endeavour to take every relevant circumstance into account before coming to a decision, and I submit that this group of amendments is unnecessary and should be resisted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 312 seeks to make it an absolute requirement that a notice should always be served. However, suppose, for example, that the tenant has disappeared. Is the landlord for ever to be denied repossession of his house because he is—obviously, in this case—unable to serve a notice?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 313 would also deny the landlord any right to change the terms of a notice once served. Again, I suspect that honourable Members have not entirely thought this through. It is conceivable that the landlord may serve a notice for repossession on the grounds, for example, of some gross
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>662</span>
misbehaviour of the tenant, and in retaliation the tenant may stop paying his rent. In those circumstances, it would be reasonable for the landlord to add this new ground to the notice, so that the court could take due notice of all the circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 262 is unnecessary. It does, however, reveal the distrust of the sheriff that lies behind this group of amendments. It adds nothing to a statutory requirement for the sheriff to consider something if the statute also enjoins the sheriff to be "just and equitable". A sheriff is bound by the duty of his office always to be just and equitable, and it is indeed faintly insulting to prescribe in statute that he must do what he always does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 263 would require the notice of proceedings for possession to be in a prescribed form. It is very hard indeed to see what any prescribed form could add to subsection (3) of clause 19, which sets out with some precision what matters the notice must cover. Furthermore, no prescribed form could possibly cover all the possible combinations and selections of grounds that a landlord might wish to invoke. A prescribed form would therefore either be of immense length, in effect repeating all of schedule 5 with invitations to score out whatever did not apply, or would be mostly blank. The only advantage of a prescribed form is where it might not be clear otherwise what was required. No such situation arises here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 323 and 324 also seek to impose an absolute requirement on the landlord to serve a notice if the house may be repossessed by a lender because of a default on the mortgage. I do not dispute that, as a general rule, a tenant should be entitled to such a notice. However, if the landlord neglects to serve such a notice, it is not the landlord who suffers; it is the creditor. It is inequitable that one person should suffer with no possibility of redress because of the neglect by another person of his statutory duty. For those reasons, I cannot accept the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I invite the Minister to stand his last argument on its head. He said that it would be outrageous if the creditor were to suffer because the landlord had neglected his statutory duties. Surely it would be even more outrageous if the tenant were to suffer in such circumstances. The point raised by my honourable Friend the Member for Dundee, East deserves further consideration by the Government. My honourable Friend described the way in which property bought for letting purposes is financed by private finance and mortgage companies. That is likely to increase under the Government's new regime. If financial difficulties arose, the property could be repossessed and sold on the open market with vacant possession. The tenant could not do anything about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To reverse the argument, it would be jolly unfair if someone, knowing that a debt had been accrued on a house, leased it to get the rent and removed the value of the property because it contained a sitting tenant. That would be a gross deception on the creditor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are arguing about the person to whom the greatest responsibility should be attached, and which person that we, as a Committee, should regard as the most important. Opposition Members believe that a person's security in his home is more important than the rights of a creditor to collect a debt. We accept that the matter is not always as simple as that, but an individual's security is so fundamental that we do not want it breached. I am fairly worried about that aspect of the legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman has raised an important point. We shall amend ground 3, so that the serving of a notice is necessary in those circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are making rapid progress. The concessions are coming thick and fast. I can hardly note them quick enough to check that they are realised in later proceedings. Clearly, we are in for a long and interesting Report stage. I welcome the Minister's assurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier, the Minister elevated the status of sheriffs to something akin to sainthood when he suggested that they always exercised perfect discretion and handed out absolute justice. Nevertheless, he confirmed that they would have discretionary powers under ground 3. On that understanding, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 264, in page 12, line 35, leave out 'begin' and insert 'raise'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 265, in page 12, line 37, leave out 'begin' and insert 'be raised'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment was proposed by Shelter. The consequences of the word "begin" are unclear. If the Bill remains unamended, a landlord would not have to issue a notice to quit, only an accurate notice of proceedings for possession to gain evictions under grounds 3 or 10 of part 1 of schedule 5. Similarly, no notice to quit would have to be issued under grounds 12 to 16 of part II of schedule 5.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In using the word "begin", it appears that the landlord can raise proceedings in the sheriff court at any time provided that the tenant receives the appropriate notice of when the proceedings will begin—for example, as long as notice is given of the date of the court hearing. The consequence would be that a tenant whose landlord was seeking eviction under a wide range of grounds would be obliged to give the tenant only two weeks' notice of the court hearing date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a requirement within the Bill about how notices of proceedings for possession should be served, unlike the requirement exists in the public rented sector in which section 84 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 sets out the requirements for the serving of a notice. That seems to add to the argument that a notice of proceedings for possession should be the minimum notice that a landlord should
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>664</span>
serve on the tenant of his intention to raise proceedings for possession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would allow the tenant time to prepare a defence and any counter claim that he may be considering. Once the notice of proceedings had expired, the landlord would be free to raise proceedings if the tenant were given due notice of when those proceedings would begin, that is, the date of the court hearing. In essence, the amendment seeks to give the tenant protection against an unscrupulous landlord who may try to move for possession on the grounds that I have mentioned without giving proper notice of his intention to do so. The amendment will tighten the slack wording in the Bill in the interests of tenants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Amendment No. 158 seeks to allow adequate time for a tenant to prepare his defence and would bring it

into line with the period of one month is provided for local authority tenants in section 47.3 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987, which provides for four weeks' notice. It relates to our debate on clause 16, during which the honourable and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn) had a few things to say about the serving of notice and the time within which such notice should be served.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary said that this would be appropriate time to consider the implications of that debate. He already made three important concessions; let us hope that there will be another.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may first explain Government amendments Nos. 177 and 178. Amendment No. 177 clarifies the point in time from which the period of notice of proceedings for possession runs. Amendment No. 178 adds an extra ground to those require at least two months' notice—that under which the tenancy has passed to another by the will or intestacy of the original tenant. I hope that both those amendments commend themselves to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
7 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On amendments Nos. 158 and 159, I was interested to hear the arguments about why two weeks would be too short a period of notice. That takes us back to the belief of Oppositions Members that landlords are not all good. We propose two weeks' notice when the tenant is at fault because it seems only fair to allow landlords to regain possession rapidly in those circumstances. If a landlord seeks possession either during or at the termination of a contractual assured tenancy, the tenant will be entitled to a notice to quit must be issued four weeks before termination. It is likely that, even after the period of notice of proceedings for possession has expired, there will be a further gap before proceedings begin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to the honourable Member for East Lothian, who said that two weeks was too short a period of notice when the landlord sought to regain possession, I remain convinced that we must provide for the possibility of recovery rapid when the tenant is at fault. In view of the strong views expressed, I am prepared to reconsider whether the limit of two weeks is right, especially for a statutory assured tenancy when there is no entitlement to a notice to quit. On that basis, I hope that the honourable Member for East Lothian will withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that he intends to bring the procedures affecting tenants under the new system into line with those apply to local authority tenants? In the atmosphere of reasonableness in the Committee, we are all trying to achieve a workable and fair framework. We had an interesting debate on clause 16 when the honourable and learned Member for Perth and Kinross suggested that the framework of serving notice, as set out in clause 16, was not realistic. He felt so strongly about it that he voted against the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing a similar principle now. The Minister said that he will reconsider the matter. Will

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall reconsider the matter.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We return to the fundamental principle of the amendment, which seeks to give a tenant adequate time to prepare his defence. Let us consider the time scale. A tenant will receive his brown envelope and, if he is like me, he will put it at the bottom of the heap and leve it for a day or two. By the time he gets round to opening it and recovers from the blind panic that will ensue, he must seek professional advice either from Citizens Advice Bureaux or, even, the honourable and learned Member for Perth and Kinross if he can afford it. There is a serious risk that any defence that he seeks to lodge will be time-barred. Two week is not long enough. I am glad that the Minister has accepted that principle and, with hs assurance, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>'(c) a notice under this section shall cease to be in force six months after the date specified in it or when it is withdrawn by the landlord, whichever is earlier.'.</p></blockquote>
This is another amendment suggested by Shelter. I say that in a sense of expectation, as the Minister has been accepting such amendments all evening. The Bill would make it possible for a landlord to apply for an order for possession months or years after first providing the notice to the tenant of his intention to apply to the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without an amendment placing a fixed time limit on the landlord's application, the court could be asked to grant possession on grounds that are no longer relevant. The tenant would be in the vulnerable position of having a possible court case hanging over him for the duration of his tenancy, despite the original matter of, say, rent arrears having been resolved and the landlord no longer having a genuine grievance against the tenant. The Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 provides that notice for proceedings is valid for a period of six months only. Therefore, it is reasonable to amend the Bill so that protection is afforded to tenants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman's argument is persuasive and I agree that it would be unacceptable for a landlord to use a notice of his intention to raise proceedings as a threat against his tenant. I do not believe that that danger will arise under the provisions of clause 19. A landlord might issue a notice of intention to raise proceedings but not act on it within a reasonable period of time. However, if he tried to use it as a justification for raising proceedings a long time later sheriffs, who are well known for their commonsense approach, would dismiss that attempt. A notice must list the grounds on which possession will be sought and it is unlikely that the same ground will apply a long time later. I hope that the honourable Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: An unscrupulous landlord could seek a notice through the courts and use it as a threat against his tenant without the matter being brough to the sheriff, who would throw it out. Tenants are often vulnerable and they would have that threat hanging over them, without being aware of the position. Will the Minister accept my amendment to protect tenants from such landlords?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would deplore threats against tenants, and that is why we want to strengthen the provisions against harassment. I am happy to reconsider the matter, but I cannot give a guarantee that I shall table an amendment. I do not believe that there is any danger of his fears being realised as I am sure that a sheriff court would rapidly rule out of order any evidence brought by a landlord that related to circumstances that occurred a long time before the more recent events outlined in the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>668</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely accept that, but I am trying to explain that a landlord may have no intention of bringing the matter to court. He may start proceedings as a threat against a tentant, who may be unaware that the landlord has no intention of going to court. The fact that proceedings have been started may be sufficient to alarm the tenant, who may then to concede adjustments to the tenancy agreement to which he or she would not otherwise have agreed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously, I am referring to a small minority of people only, but it would be possible for a landlord to begin proceedings without the intention of going to a sheriff court. The institution of proceedings may be used to browbeat a tenant, so I am asking the Minister to agree to the amendment so that it may be possible to stop such developments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand what the honourable Gentleman means, but I cannot add to what I have already said on the subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My honourable Friend is referring to a form of harassment. The Minister says that we shall debate provisions that are intended to stamp out that practise. For as long as there have been landlords and tenants there has been scope for harassment, and I fear that it will take place more frequently in future as a consequence of the insecurity built into the Bill. I recently came across examples of that sort of behaviour. Landlords go through the motions of starting proceedings to evict tenants in the knowledge that a sufficient number of them will be so alarmed by the hassle that is likely to be involved that they will leave and move in with relatives or neighbours. That has happened and will happen in future.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall consider the matter and write to the honourable Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) in due course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With that assurance, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment made:</i> No. 178, in page 12, line 42, after '8', insert '9.—[MR. JAMES DOUGLAS-HAMILTON.]</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 319, in page 13, line 4, leave out subsection (6).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take the following amendments: No. 267, in page 13, line 6, leave out from beginning of line to 'is' in line 7.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No. 268, in page 13, line 9, leave out 'becomes or'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am somewhat disturbed by the nature of the statutory assured tenancy provided for in the legislation. It may aptly be described as a sudden death tenancy because a tenant will have no way of knowing when a landlord might seek to initiate proceedings to put him out and against which he would have virtually no protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It must be unreasonable for a landlord to agree a statutory assured tenancy with his tenant or to allow him to remain resident for such a long time that he automatically becomes a statutory assured tenant and then to turn nasty and try to evict that tenant. There must be a better framework for such circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that the only grounds on which a landlord should have eviction rights should be when he genuinely requires the house for himself of his family for urgent reasons, when a tenant had persistently refused to pay rent or when the person was such a bad tenant that he was wrecking the property or engaging in similar extreme behaviour. However, the Government are providing for eviction proceedings to be possible when they are not necessarily justified and we do not like that principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 267 and 268 have been proposed by Shelter, and I hope that the Minister will be well disposed towards them. Their purpose is to disallow service of a notice of proceedings for possession on a contractual assured tenancy without a notice to quit being issued to terminate the tenancy and thus creating a statutory assured tenancy. In the view of Shelter, only a notice to quit should terminate a contractual tenancy and create a statutory tenancy. Therefore, it should not be possible to serve a notice of proceedings for possession during a contractual tenancy. The amendments do not affect the provision contained elsewhere in the same subsection that a notice can relate, in whole or part, to events occurring during a contractual tenancy, even though the tenant has become a statutory assured tenant. This argument follows from amendments relating to clause 18(6) and clause 19(3).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I invite the Minister to comment on those representations from Shelter and others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 19(6) provides that a sheriff cannot exercise his discretion under subsection (1) to dispense with a notice requirement if a landlord seeks possession on ground 10 when a tenant is more than three months in arrears with rent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With this group of amendments, I suspect that we return to the belief that landlords should have no rights at all. Amendment No. 319 would have the quite indefensible and arbitrary effect that a landlord who wanted to recover possession would have to send, after the initial notice to quit, two identical notices of proceedings for possession. I do not know if that was the intention, but I can see no justification for it.

Amendments Nos. 267 and 268 are a further reflection of the ludicrous proposition, now
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>670</span>
embodied in amendment No. 260, that during a contractual tenancy there should be no grounds on which a landlord may regain possession. I have already made it clear that that would be a totally impossible position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to hear that the Minister thinks that Shelter and similar bodies, which are concerned about the prospects for tenants under the Bill's provisions, are proposing ludicrous amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remain profoundly unhappy about the way in which statutory assured tenancies are likely to function. They will be an ugly and indefensible feature of housing tenure in Scotland, and I do not feel inclined to seek leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have already spend a considerable time in dealing with amendments to clause 19. The clause provides important safeguards for tenants. It sets out the procedure that must be followed before a sheriff can entertain proceedings for possession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although some honourable Members seem to want no tenant ever to face eviction, the fact remains that occasions will arise when the landlord must, in all reasonableness, be allowed to regain possession of his own house. We are trying to provide an appropriate balance between the rights of tenants and landlords. However, when the question of repossession arises, the tenant will have the right to adequate warning, and that is what clause 19 provides. I commend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not feel enthusiastic about the clause. The only relevant comment on it was made by the Law Society of Scotland, which stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We find this part of the Bill to be particularly complex. It will, we are sure, provide a fruitful source of litigation for both landlord and tenant."</p></blockquote>
No doubt that is how it will appear to lawyers, solicitors and everyone else who is concerned. However, my lack of enthusiasm for the clause will not surprise the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Clause 19, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
	<p>Further consideration adjourned.—[	<i>Mr. Maclean.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<i>Adjourned accordingly at eighteen minutes past Seven o'clock till Tuesday, 16 February at half-past Ten o'clock.</i></p>
