<div class='page-header'><h1>Housing (Scotland) Bill</h1></div>
<p>[Continued from col. 956]</p>
<p>9 pm</p>
<p><i>On resuming</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I was saying, I hope that such cases will hardly happen. Marriage is very much to be recommended. In the circumstances where more than one person claims to be the surviving spouse of the dead tenant and therefore eligible to succeed to the tenancy, we think that the sheriff should be entitled to decide the matter. The main example will be two cohabitees. It may not be clear that the original marriage was dissolved. It may not be clear who was at the relevant time living in the house. The hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) asked how we could resolve such matters. It will depend on the facts and circumstances and the sheriff could be trusted to act with the wisdom of Solomon.<br><br>
The provision is an obvious piece of natural justice for cohabitees. It was not suggested by any pressure group, but they all supported it when they commented on it. The Church of Scotland did not comment on it. Paragraph 2 (2) is phrased in respectful, sober terms. It says:
<br><blockquote><p>"For the purposes of this paragraph, a person who was living with the original tenant as his or her wife or husband shall be treated as the spouse of the original tenant."</p></blockquote>
I think that we can trust the sheriff court to come to a wise decision as to who was the spouse in those circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to hear that the Minister and other Committee Members are still sober. I accept the point that the sheriff should have discretion in such matters. My hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) was referring to the sort of considerations that might have to be taken into account and that might have competing priority in determining which cohabitee would have right of succession under the clause. There is the question of children. The tenant may have a spouse who has been living away from him for some time. He may have a cohabitee with their children staying in the house.<br><br>
I dare say that the wife of the tenant who is living away from him might try to stake a claim to the tenancy of the house. I hope that it could be established that when it is the family home for the children, regardless of what may have happened to the tenant's earlier marriage, the sheriff should take
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 958</span>
account of the special needs of the children. Is it the Government's intention that the sheriff should exercise discretion to ensure that the remaining parent and his or her children living in a household in such circumstances could retain the tenancy and to succeed to the tenancy and that such issues would not be confused by the fact that there may be a spouse who might have had an earlier claim but a less strong family claim.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must state my own view. The courts should have regard to the best interests of the children in such cases. The subparagraph makes it clear that:—
<br><blockquote><p>"a person who was living with the original tenant as his or her wife or husband shall be treated as the spouse".</p></blockquote>
That must turn on the facts and circumstances. The sheriff is the best person to judge those circumstances by hearing all the details of the case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The provision is not clear. It does not suggest how the matter will be resolved between the competing tenants. It does not suggest a summary application, for example, which is obviously cheaper. It does not make allowance for the circumstances when there is no agreement. Under the Bill, there must be an agreement between the competing spouses, or there must be an application to the sheriff. What will happen when one of the tenants, just does not care?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have on earlier clauses readily clutched at the prospect of giving sheriffs discretion. It would not lie easily in my mouth to say that the sheriff should not have discretion. However, there is a difference between the cases that we have been discussing, where sheriffs have been operating the law in a way that has built up over a period of years. The provision, which I welcome, leaves them with a completely blank sheet. The Law Society has put its finger on an important omission. The Government would improve the legislation by inserting a provision to take into account the comparative length of residence with the tenant and responsibility for any offspring of the tenant. The sheriff should take those matters into account together with all other facts.<br><br>
While we are giving the sheriff discretion, we are providing no scales by which the sheriff can weigh the merits and balance the arguments on either side. Inevitably there will be circumstances when the sheriffs will be left with as much guidance and ability to judge the question as the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker), who said that he did not feel competent to judge such matters. Left to the devices of the clause as it stands, I am much inhibited in taking a view. We are asking sheriffs to resort to their personal opinions. Sheriffs are not supposed to resort to their personal opinions. They are supposed to interpret Acts of Parliament. We are creating a problem for sheriffs and we should recognise that. It is not good enough for the Government to say that the facts and circumstances shall judge because I can see rich veins of potential litigation going right through to the European Court of Justice if we do not provide the sheriff with a peg on which to hang the exercise of his discretion.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 959</span>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is not much that I can add. I believe that it will turn on the facts and circumstances of each case. Scotland is not like the middle east and certain countries where a man may have several wives. Polygamy does not exist in Scotland. It turns on the facts and circumstances in relation to Paragraph 2. The Sheriff is well able to make an appropriate decision arising from the circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has the Minister considered the two points that I made?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry. The answer is the summary procedure under section 103 of the 1984 Act.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister say in what way the link is made? The other more serious point is that the Bill seems to provide two possibilities. There is the third possibility that a spouse or a cohabitee who may have a claim may not be interested in a claim as opposed to the other individual who is living in the house. At present, the landlord might be able to deny that person the opportunity because there is no competition with the spouse or cohabitee. No one will be able to be determined as the succeeding tenant by agreement or by the court. Does that not put extra power in the hands of the landlord?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The schedule makes the position clear. It says
<br><blockquote><p>"such one of them as may be decided by agreement". If, as the hon. Gentleman suggested, someone did not pursue a claim the matter would be agreed, perhaps by default. The sheriff is involved where there is a potential dispute and I am sure that he will be able to decide on the appropriate action.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 485, in page 60, leave out lines 34 and 35.<br><br>
We now come to a series of related amendments, all dealing with succession. It may be best to deal with them as quickly as possible and wrap up that discussion in the debate on the schedule as a whole, but that is a matter for you, Mr. Lambie.<br><br>
The amendment seeks to allow for succession by a family member other than a spouse where the family has been living in the accommodation for fewer than five years before the death of the protected or statutory tenant. The present Rent Acts allow a member of the tenant's family to succeed to the tenancy where there is no spouse provided, first, that the family member has lived with the tenant for the six months immediately before the tenant's death. The Bill proposes that the tenant should have lived with the tenant for five years rather than six months.<br><br>
Moreover, by inserting the phrase "in the dwelling-house" into the five-year provision, the Bill says that unless both the original protected or statutory tenant and the prospective successor have lived in the dwelling-house for five years before the tenant's death there is no right to succeed. If a single parent, for example, dies without having lived in his
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 960</span>
or her home for at least five years, any children old enough to take on the tenancy will be prohibited from doing so and may lose their home as well as their parent. The additional phrase "in the dwelling-house" will have a severely restricting effect, disallowing the succession to a protected or statutory tenancy for family members other than spouses unless the family has lived for five years in that house. A family member other than a spouse can succeed only to an assured tenancy rather than to the greater rights of a protected tenancy, so there can be no justification for further restricting the right of succession.<br><br>
Far from making a minor change in the rules of succession, the insertion of the words "in the dwelling-house" would result in many people losing their right to succeed. The rule is already being changed to allow succession only when a family member has lived with the protected or statutory tenant for five years, so it is unreasonable to restrict mobility by disallowing succession where the family member may have lived with the original tenant all his or her life, but where the original tenant took up occupation of the dwelling-house less than five years before dying. The changes in the Bill would have serious consequences.<br><br>
The Minister has already agreed to consider the issue in the context of housing associations, so I live in hope that he may extend the precedent established then into the wider remit covered by the schedule.</span></p>
<p>9.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment and what has been said about it by the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood). A number of important principles are at stake, the first of which is the weight being given to landlords' interests as against those of tenants. It is a myth that the provision acts against landlords' interests. People looking for housing in Scotland are usually loking for secure long-term housing for their families at a reasonable price. They want accommodation in a decent area where they can bring up their families in peace, stability and certainty.<br><br>
The question of what happens to accommodation when the original tenant dies is a sensitive one. How should we treat those left behind? The Minister has already confirmed that the new assured tenancy, designed to replace all statutory and protected tenancies, will provide no protection. Schedule 5, paragraph 9, gives the landlord the option of terminating the tenancy on the death of the original tenant. So we are talking about tenancies that will gradually by phased out and replaced by the new type of tenancy. Here the Government are trying to restrict tenants' rights even further, in a way that I find unsavoury.<br><br>
The time of the tenant's death will be traumatic for any spouse or cohabitee, and the Government are throwing wide open any certainty that such a person would have had about future accommodation. People who would ordinarily be entitled to succeed when their parents died will be thrown into confusion, too. The Government are showing great insensitivity at
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0607">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 961</span>
the expense of tenants' interests—and for what? We are told that the Scottish housing market will open up, but if that means trampling over those people's rights it would not be worth doing.<br><br>
The amendment attempts to remove what may seem a meaningless phrase—the requirement to have lived in the dwelling-house—but it would provide a significant protection. The obvious examples are battered wives and children who have left home. Because of violence or other bad behaviour by the tenant the relatives may have had to leave home. The change from six months to five years will make it impossible for such people to succeed to a home into which they may have put a tremendous amount—far more than the original tenant. They will suffer because of the new insensitive requirements. As the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire said, the Committee must examine the matter seriously.<br><br>
Unless the Minister can do what he has not done yet and give the Committee satisfactory positive evidence of a problem that needs the solution in the schedule, I urge the Committee to accept both this amendment and the others that would restore to the spouses and children of tenants some of the rights that the Government seek to remove.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) and the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) put a general case in support of the amendment. Will the Minister consider two specific cases which were referred to me by the Scottish Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux? The first concerns a client whose mother was terminally ill. The client had brought her mother to stay with her family but, because the mother could not settle after the move, the client was considering whether to move into her mother's home to care for her. The client sought advice from SACAB about her rights to succeed to her mother's tenancy. At the time, her mother had less than 12 months to live.<br><br>
The second case concerned a young man who sought the bureau's advice about his right to succeed to his mother's tenancy. The tenancy had already been passed from his father to his mother on his father's death. He had lived in the property for three years and his mother's illness had also been diagnosed as terminal. Under existing legislation, the citizens advice bureau were able to reassure those clients that they probably could succeed to their parents' tenancies. They would be allowed to care for their parents, secure in the knowledge that they were unlikely to be made homeless after their parents' death.<br><br>
However, the Bill will increase the length of time for which close relatives must reside in the home to ensure their succession to the tenancy. Under the provisions, neither of the people to whom I referred could have succeeded to the tenancies of their homes on the death of their mothers.<br><br>
The right to succeed is a valuable right. It presents many single people with the only opportunity to obtain decent accommodation as well as allowing families to care for each other in the community in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 962</span>
line with the Goverment's policy. The changes that the provision would bring to that right of succession are a retrograde step. Will the Minister consider seriously the cases that SACAB drew to our attention, and the way in which the clause will operate against people who are caring for their parents during the terminal stages of illness? The provision will necessitate such people risking homelessness to look after their parents in the community. I am sure that the Minister does not want that to happen. I hope that he will reconsider the matter and make allowances for such cases.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, those are cases when we must balance accurately and fairly the rights of landlords and the rights of tenants and get the balance as near right as possible. The amendment would remove the phrase "in the dwelling-house". The positive evidence for the need for the phrase is because of the large decline in the private rented sector.<br><br>
One thing that is wrong with the existing succession rules for regulated tenancies is that someone who has no links with the house, and has never lived in it, can succeed to its tenancy. The words that amendment No. 485 seek to remove are designed to correct that anomaly. I do not accept the case for allowing someone who has been living elsewhere to succeed to the tenancy of that house, even if he had been residing with its tenant for six months.<br><br>
The main case when that could arise is when the tenant had retained the tenancy but went to live with a member of his family. In those circumstances, the family member already has accommodation, so there is no need for him to take over the tenancy. The amendment is not justified.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minster's answer was appalling, especially in the context of the cases which the citizens advice bureau brought to our attention. The Minister said that we are dealing with people who have no links with the house concerned. In the two cases that I highlighted, the people have links with the houses concerned. Their mothers lived in them. Those individuals were faced with the dilemma of either caring for their mothers and risking homelessness or leaving their parents not properly looked after in their homes. What is the Minister's response to such cases? Is he saying that those people must surrender the tenancy rights of their homes, so that they can look after their mothers and become homeless when they die? The Minister must clarify the position.<br><br>
I know that the Minister is speaking from a prepared text that was drafted before the cases were drawn to his attention. However, I can give him the correspondence from the Scottish Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux for him to consider to see whether he can introduce an amendment that would allow such people to care for their parents in such circumstances without risking homelessness.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to ask the Minister a further question. If he leaves the other parts of the Bill in place, but removes the words "in the dwelling-house", would that not leave in the Bill the provision
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0608">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 963</span>
of a five-year residency period, although it would not necessarily cover a specific dwelling-house? That would substantially redress the balance in the landlord's favour in any case.<br><br>
The Minister rightly said that the question is one of balancing interests. But the combination of the phrase together with the substitution of six months for a five-year period throws the balance in completely the opposite direction, even if we accept that the balance is currently in favour of the tenants. Has the Minister considered that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That issue is covered by the next group of amendments which we shall discuss fully when we reach them. In any case to which the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr McAllion) referred, the young man is not living in the dwelling-house concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He has been living there for three years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Well, all that I can say is that he will not be covered by the five-year rule.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the interpretation of the legislation, as it stands, is that the young man will not be covered. If his mother died within 12 months, he would have resided for only four years in the house, so he would be out on his ear. I am asking the Minister to put himself in the position of the young man who will have to make an agonising choice. He could either look after his mother for 12 months until she died, or look for alternative accommodation to prevent himself from becoming homeless when his mother eventually does die. The Minister must have some heart.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, the circumstances which the hon. Gentlemen mentions are difficult. One reason why the private rented sector has shrunk so much is that the landlord cannot reclaim the house in due course because of the current succession rights. The line must be drawn somewhere. We believe that we have done that as fairly as is possible in the circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was the most hair-raising speech that any Minister has ever made. He suggested that the revival of the private rented sector is more important than encouraging families to care for dying parents. I suspect that those words may come back to haunt the Minister and his Administration for a long time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend consider that that is ironic in the light of the previous debate? The hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) said that it is most important to keep the family together. Now the Minister is deliberately putting the interests of private profit before the family, and before people who are looking after members of their families who are terminally ill.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 964</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am astonished by the Minister's words, and would like to give him time to reconsider them. They will reflect badly on him and his Government for a long time to come. I do not like playing politics on matters such as housing and hope that the Minister will get up now and say something rather different and suggest that looking after elderly and dying people in Scottish households is more important than the Government's objective of encouraging the private rented sector. There are some depths to which it is not worth descending in encouraging the private sector.<br><br>
The Minister has now had a minute or two to reflect on what he said, and I hope that he will retract some of his comments.</span></p>
<p>9.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the case that the hon. Member for Dundee, East mentioned, it is obviously desirable that the landlord should let the house to the tenant, and I hope that in the majority of such cases that will happen. There may be special requirements that the private sector will not now provide to the extent that we would wish, but if we strengthen that sector and more tenancies become available on the open market, such a tenant could easily get another tenancy quite quickly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We shall have to pursue this matter. The Minister seemed to suggest that in the two cases that SACAB described the people involved would have to rely on having the luck to have landlords who will not apply the laws implemented by the Government and who will excuse their tenants from the full consequences of the laws for which the Minister is responsible. It is nonsense for the Minister to say that the Government cannot legislate for such contingencies because these are exceptional cases. Even if we amended the Bill to cover people in those circumstances, it would in no way militate against any putative revival of the private rented sector.<br><br>
The Minister suggested that hundreds of thousands of cases might arise across Scotland and prevent the private rented sector from reviving. That is nonsense. The Minister should accept that it is and give way on the humane point that SACAB has brought to our attention. I shall give the Minister the SACAB brief which he can take away to study, so that he can come back with an amendment to cover these continguencies.<br><br>
If there is any humanity on the Conservative side of the Committee, the Bill will be amended.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have perhaps exhausted the debate, if not the arguments. I support Opposition Members' statements about their disappointment at the way in which the Government are handling the issue. There is scope for manouevre without adhering rigidly to the provisions in the Bill; the Minister should try to draft a more humane formula.<br><br>
The Committee will wish to deliberate on this issue and return to it on Report, and on that basis I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may take the following amendments:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 284, in page 60, line 37, leave out 'five' and insert 'one'.</p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are back on the same territory; the Minister was right to point out that I was ahead of myself, and I used some arguments on the last amendment that I should have saved for this.<br><br>
The purpose of amendment No. 486 is clear. We want to ensure that the members of a deceased tenant's family can continue to succeed to the tenancy, provided that they have been resident with the original tenant for the six months before his death.<br><br>
Paragraph 3(b) of schedule 6 says:
<br><blockquote><p>"For the words 'period of six months' there shall be substituted the words 'period of five years'; and,"</p></blockquote>
thus extending the qualifying period for succession to a tenancy to five years. The debate on the previous amendment showed that a member of the family of a deceased protected or statutory tenant can succeed to the tenancy provided that he or she has been resident with the original tenant for at least six months before the death of that tenant.<br><br>
There is no justification for changing the qualifying period so arbitrarily, and it represents a major erosion of rights. The proposal contradicts the Government's stated commitment not to disturb existing private rented sectors. Hardship will be experienced in just the sort of case to which the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) alluded on the previous amendment. Those cases deserve the Minster's further attention.<br><br>
This is an important amendment, and I accept that the argument will overlap those on the previous amendment so I shall make no further introduction but wait and see if we can get some movement from the Minister on this rather more finely focused amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can see no justification for altering the time limit in this way. It will make it much more difficult for tenants to qualify for succession in those circumstances. It looks to me like another device to make it easier for landlords to break tenancies and ensure that succession cannot take place, allowing them to let again for a higher rent or to sell with vacant possession at a premium. The thrust of the Government's legislation is to encourage the private rented sector, apparently literally, regardless of human or any other cost.<br><br>
Why did the Government change the criterion from six months to five years? Also, what proportion of successor tenants who would qualify now under the criterion will be cut out by the extension to five years? The Government must have done some research into the impact of the legislation.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 966</span>
Presumably some proportion of the people who hope to succeed as tenants will be debarred under the legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Throughout our proceedings today my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) has asked for evidence and little has come forward. Even the statistics that we have been given have been muddled and confusing. But these are important questions. As my hon. Friend said, the Bill is introducing a fundamantal breach of the rights of tenants, and we are asking what evidence the Minister has to back up this change which will seriously affect a particularly vulnerable section of the community.<br><br>
I saved a constituency case to mention in this debate which is similar to the cases highlighted by SACAB. One of my constituents approached me two or three months ago. She was a lady in her late 50s, divorced and suffering from a heart complaint. Her mother was in her 80s, lived in a seperate house, and was no longer able to look after herself. My constituent wanted to know if she could move in with her mother, but have some security. She wanted me to approach the district council about the possibility of a joint tenancy. The district council was fairly amenable to that, and it was a perfect solution. The district council could not guarantee that the lady would succeed to the tenancy, because of the present six month requirement and its policy. However, it considered the question of joint tenancy.<br><br>
That was a public authority with public obligations. My constituent had to give up her house. She also needed medical attention, but she was prepared to become a carer. Many people, particularly women, become carers for elderly relatives rather than allow them to go into care. That often saves great public expense. Those relatives would go into either local authority care, a nursing home or hospital. Carers often sacrifice their careers, comforts and pleasures to care for elderly relatives, because they feel an obligation. They do not want their relatives stuffed away in a local authority home or hospital.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister is not aware that such care would cost the state about £200 a week in DHSS and other allowances. Relatives give it almost for free. That is why there is both an economic and moral force behind the arguments of my hon. Friend and Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an important point. There are huge savings for the state. I should have thought that the Government would encourage rather than discourage that, but such carers will be the most seriously affected.<br><br>
The Minister is right that a young, healthy, employed adult, living in his parent's home when the parent dies, can go off into the new market place—the new Mecca—where homes will fall off trees and be readily available for everyone. I speak cynically because I do not believe that that will happen. Such people may find suitable accommodation quickly, but they may have contributed to the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0610">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 967</span>
accommodation that will be taken away from them. The Mecca predicted by the Minister may not arise, and the Bill may create further homelessness problems—another twist to the spiral.<br><br>
If my constituent had had her problem a year from now, she may have been unable to get a joint tenancy, because the local authority or private landlord could not make that decision. She may have had to go into local authority care, rather than living in her mother's home, which she shared for many years.<br><br>
The Government suggest that a person must have lived in the house for five years before he can succeed to the tenancy. Compelling arguments suggest that that figure is arbitrary and has no basis whatsoever in any evidence or fact that could satisfy the Committee. Most Conservative Members will feel obliged to avoid embarassing the Government, but there must be some sense of wrong-doing.<br><br>
I urge the Minister to consider his actions carefully. The five year period is lengthy. Off the top of my head, and from recollection, statistics suggest that the average family moves every seven years. Five years are a huge chunk of that seven years. The Minster must justify such a serious change. If his attitude becomes public knowledge, I am confident that he will be under pressure to consider change seriously. He has shown heartlessness, although he has been tenacious in sticking to his brief. He should apply his mind to the problems that he will create, not only for those affected by the measure, but to his image. We have previously called him sensitive and caring, but are seeing another side to him.<br><br>
9.45 pm<br><br>
The matter must be considered seriously. There is no justification or evidence for such a serious change. How much pressure is placed on landlords? How many representations has the Minister had from landlords who are upset that they cannot recover possession of property? How many successions are there in a year? Does the Minister even have statistics? How many people die and hand over their tenancy to someone more remote than a spouse?<br><br>
I do not believe that the Minister has any figures. They have been pulled out of the air to justify the wholesale transfer of tenants' rights, so that a mythical free market is created, with houses becoming available. That will not happen<br><br>
The Minister failed to provide us with figures for the number of houses likely to come onto the market. The answer that we got was, "Lots". If the Minister knew how many private sector houses were not being rented, and considered the quality of such houses not the figures and statistics, he would know that we are talking about uninhabitable tenaments that require modernisation and are below the tolerable standard that many people would rent. There are "lots" of those houses. Masses of houses will not come onto the market. Restricting the rights of succession will create homelessness for people who provide the state with a service. The Minister must consider that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The answer is very much the opposite. The more the private rented
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 968</span>
sector is revived, the more assistance will be given to homeless people, either directly or indirectly. The hon. Gentleman asked about a joint tenancy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not ask.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Well, he presented us with an example. In such circumstances, there is no problem if a landlord agrees to a joint tenancy. I accept that, from the tenant's point of view, any qualifying period might be too short. Under the present rules there is no succession if the carer, or person caring for a relative or friend, has lived with the tenant for only five months. In a sense any period is too short. We must get the balance right. We think that five years is right.<br><br>
The hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr Home Robertson) asked what proportion of successor tenants would be debarred. I cannot answer that with certainty but I can say with certainty that most successions are by spouses, and those will not be affected by the proposed changes.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked why the period should be five years. That period be long enough to prove genuine connections with the house involved. The present succession rules are weighted too heavily against landlords. A member of a tenant's family, other than his spouse, can succeed to the tenancy even if he was living with the tenant for only six months before his death. That, together with the other succession provisions in the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984, means that a landlord can lose control over the letting of his property for three generations and be faced with a series of tenants who may have had little connection with each other, and little real link with the house itself when they initially take over the tenancy. It was because of those considerations that we decided that the succession rules should be changed.<br><br>
First, we decided that anyone other than the dead tenant's spouse succeeding to the tenancy should succeed to a statutory assured tenancy rather than a statutory regulated tenancy. Our second proposal to which the amendments are addressed, is that the residence qualification should be increased from six months to five years. Five years seems to be a long enough period to ensure that the successor to the tenancy will have developed real links with the house and will therefore have a justifiable entitlement to succeed.<br><br>
I shall of course listen to what Opposition Members have to say, but I have to make it clear that it is important to ensure that anyone given a statutory right to succession has incontrovertibly strong links with the house.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister might listen to what hon. Members say, but I suspect that we shall listen to him with significantly less respect in future as a consequence of what he has said. Fortunately, he has confirmed that most tenancies that are passed on by succession go to spouses. However, he could not say how many other types of succession there are. He does not have a clue. The Minister is legislating in the dark, not only figuratively but literally at this
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0611">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 969</span>
time of night. The Government have no notion of the impact of this legislation.<br><br>
Until now it has been understood and written into the legislation that anyone who had been resident in a house for six months before the tenant died would have the right to succeed. Out of a hat, the Minister produces the five year criterion. He says that someone would have developed a closer interest in the house if he had been there for five years. Why five years? A person's commitment to a member of his family who is in need is the most, significant factor in the circumstances that my hon. Friends have described. We are talking about careers, who will be the group most affected by the legislation. The Minister is proposing a substantial change. He says that a qualifying period of five years is satisfactory, but six months is not. It will debar many people who would otherwise have been able to succeed to the tenancy.<br><br>
The Minister said that the present legislation is weighted too heavily against the landlord, who should have the right to debar or refuse to take on a tenant. Let us consider what type of people we are talking about. We are talking about a responsible grown up child who is prepared to move in with an elderly parent to care for him in his last months or years. Is that the type of person whom a reasonable landlord would not want to accept as a tenant? Is that the type of person whom the Government think should be allowed to be discarded by a landlord? Does not the Minister agree that a responsible society and a responsible Government should encourage people to care for elderly relatives? Much lip service is paid to the need to look after the carers, but the Government seek to legislate against them. A landlord can refuse to pass on a tenancy to someone who might have sacrificed his career or even his own house to live with a relative for four years or more, just because that relative did not survive for the requisite five years. That is an appalling scenario.<br><br>
The current qualifying period of six months makes sense. I accept that there is a need for a qualifying period, and after six months a person is unlikely to have cut himself totally adrift from his previous connections. It would be silly to allow someone to succeed after being in a property for a matter of a few weeks. The Minister should be ashamed that the Government are legislating to exclude a career after six months merely to encourage private landlords. What types of private landlord would not be prepared to accept a tenant of the type that we have been discussing? Why cannot the Government leave in place legislation that protects the interests of such people? The Minister is losing a few friends tonight. I had thought better of him. I am surprised that he has the gall to defend such a change in the law, because it is totally indefensible. I hope that the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire will stick to his guns.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to what the hon. Gentleman said. It is easy to say that the Government do not care. In another context, Opposition Members said that if council houses were sold they would not become available again for people to let because they would be taken off the market. We live in a world in which there are different
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 970</span>
pressures and demands. One of the demands that is not being met at the moment is that for private lets, which are not available on the market. If they are to exist and work, they should not be operated in a way that is too restrictive.<br><br>
I understand the problem of someone who assist an elderly relative. Perhaps my experiene is different from that of the hon. Member for Dundee East (Mr. McAllion), but I belive that it usually works the other way round—elderly people go to live with younger relatives. That is the normal practice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The case that SACAB brought to our attention was one in which an elderly person had gone to live with a younger relative but could not settle and insisted on moving back to her own house. The daughter could not allow her to do that, nor did she wish to surrender the rights to her own house and move in with her.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again, I draw attentioin to the fact that there would have to be a marvellous scenario with the choice of moving back and so on. They are trying to raise emotive hairs—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: SACAB.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I have read it. The hon. Gentlemen should bear in mind that the legislation aims to open up opportunities for as many people as possible. If someone needs to look after elderly relatives, as I hope will happen—</span></p>
<p>10 pm</p>
<p><i>Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.</i></p>
<p>10.20 pm</p>
<p><i>On resuming</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When we were interrupted, I was about to say that the Government are attempting to give more people the opportunity to have lets in the private housing sector and to encourage landlords to offer more properties for let. The six-months period may be far too short. However, some people would say that five years was far too long. We have listended to Opposition Members heartfelt pleas and the cases that they have put forward—which, I am sure, exist. However, they must remember that the Government have to strike a balance so that the legislation will achieve the intended results.<br><br>
I was serious when I said that people should not have to put their own home at risk when it becomes necessary to move in with an elderly relative. The Government must bear that in mind. However, more often than not the elderly relative goes to live with younger members of the family so problems will not arise. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will bear in mind that we look to the Government to create a proper balance. They should give consideration to the cases that have been put forward but, equally, they must bear in mind that legislation has to cater for the bulk of the market and the overall aim of increasing the number of private lets available.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0612">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 971</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When I hear the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) trying to be reasonable, I am spurred on to greater efforts.<br><br>
A number of points have been made but one thing still niggles at me—it is the distinction that the Government are creating between tenants in the public sector and those in the private sector. Tenants in the private sector will eventually have no right to succession. The legislation is inexorably leading to that state of affairs. The right to succession will be lost, along with many other rights. When the legislation has worked its way through the system and all the protected and secured tenancies have gone, landlords will simply fall back on ground 9—the simple ground of the death of a spouse or patent. That is what we are heading for.<br><br>
That contrasts with the rights of tenants in the public sector under section 52 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 where the qualifying period is 12 months. I find it difficult to understand why the distinction should be made.<br><br>
The amendments suggest 12 months. They recognise the balance of which the hon. Member for Tayside, North spoke, and the fact that the Government want to shift the emphasis. Surely a period of 12 months is not too much too ask for. The Government have already conceded that such a period is appropriate for public sector tenants. Five years would exclude many people, including carers. It will not exclude those who have always lived with their parents, but it will discourage people who have to make the crucial and sensitive decision to go and live with their parents. The 12-month period suggested by the amendments strikes me as entirely reasonable. It shifts the balance away from the tenants and to the landlord and, in any case, the measure will apply to a fairly small number of people.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman will bear in mind that before the legislation that destroyed the private rented sector was brought in—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It did not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Oh yes it did. Private landlords then, in cities such as Dundee, were happy to pass on properties to the relatives of the tenant who had died. After all, the property had to be let to someone and landlords were only too happy to continue with the family that was already in tenancy. They knew what sort of tenants they were and it was easier to keep the existing tenants than to make changes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to what my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) said about the substantial demand for more private lets and the need to have a proper balance. I also listened carefully to hon. Members who said that a residence requirement of five years would be too long. I am impressed by their strength of feeling and concern, especially about carers, and I am also aware of the fears expressed by other organisations on that point. The current qualification of six months is too short but I am far from convinced that 12 months is the right period. I undertake to give more thought to the matter but I cannot give any commitment.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 972</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to give the Minister a concrete example. I wrote to the Secretary of State for Scotland on Sunday—although I gather that the Minister of State, Scottish Office, will be dealing with it—about a disabled lady who lives in Marchmont in a rented flat. Her daughter now lives with her and looks after her. Their case is tangential to the matter because her daughter also has her own flat in Argyll, on which she pays rates of about £90. I wrote to the Secretary of State because, under the poll tax legislation, the daughter will have to pay £440 in Argyll and mother and daughter will pay a combined poll tax in Edinburgh of £720 as against £550 rates now. They are big losers. My predecessor took up the case—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is not relevant to the narrow amendment. I was allowing the hon. Gentleman to develop his point, but it is not the main part of his case. He should bring himself back into order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope to do so immediately. The woman is clearly a carer living in her mother's rented flat. With the six-month regulation there is no problem; she could give up her house in Argyll and stay with her mother.<br><br>
If a similar person asked me whether she should move in with her parent under a tenancy that will be regulated by the clause, I would tell her not to move in to look after her mother unless she knew that her mother was not likely to die within five years.<br><br>
10.30 pm<br><br>
At the moment I am helping my constituent with her poll tax problem. I will be duty bound to point out to her that she might, if her tenancy were regulated by the Bill, have to calculate whether her mother would live for five years. People do not lightly move in with their parents. In my 10 years' experience of local authority housing, I have known very few cases when relatives have moved in with parents for the bogus purposes of maintaining the tenancy. The six months' qualification period has served us well. The five years' qualification period will deter people from taking on a caring role at great personal sacrifice. I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that the sort of person to whom my hon. Friend refers will probably take on the obligation anyway, regardless of risk to herself. I applaud people who are prepared to make the enormous sacrifices involved in taking on the responsibility of looking after an elderly parent or relative. It is despicable that the Government seem to be taking advantage of such people. Already the nation takes advantage of those people's good will, because they are shouldering an enormous burden of looking after elderly people. To add injury to insult, there is the increased risk of people not being able to remain secure in the house after going through the trauma of looking after an elderly relative.<br><br>
The Minister made some conciliatory noises, but I was not impressed. I am inclined to leave the debate at this stage and to give the Minister a little more time to consider the problem. I am sure that all hon.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0613">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 973</span>
Members will want to return to the matter on Report in the hope of achieving a more positive result.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am perhaps more easily impressed than the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson). I listened carefully to the Minister and I think that there may be some room for manoeuvre. I listened to the remarks of the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) with interest. I bet a monkey to a mouse trap that in the earlier stages of his colourful progress through life the hon. Gentleman moved house far more frequently and perhaps more than once every five years. Five years is not a long time. I remember when I was a provincial solicitor advising young people who were buying and selling houses, that I told them that they were making an important decision, but statistics showed that they would move every seven years in the earlier part of their lives when they were establishing their family.<br><br>
The five-year qualifying period is very onerous. I clutch at the straw that the Minister offered. None of us will be overjoyed if he extends it. We may agree or disagree with the political ethos behind the Bill, but the Minister does not need to specify five years to achieve what he wants. We should prefer one or two years. That strikes a balance between what he wants and what we want. On that basis, I am willing to return to these important arguments on Report. I beg to aks leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 487, in page 60, leave out lines 38 to 40.<br><br>
This is a variation on the same theme. I appreciate that the Committee may be puzzled about the ethos behind the amendment. The point was picked up by Shelter. The purpose of deleting lines 38 to 40 is to preserve the rights of all successors to a statutory tenancy under the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984.<br><br>
When a statutory or a protected tenant dies, the spouse or qualifying member of the family succeeds and has a statutory Rent Act tenancy. However, the Bill proposes to make a distinction between a succeeding spouse and a succeeding family member. A spouse will continue to succeed to a statutory Rent Act tenancy, but a family member will be given a statutory assured tenancy. Shelter says that that restriction is unnecessary as well as arbitrary and is an unjust erosion of tenants' rights. There is no justification for making such a distinction between the rights of a succeeding spouse and those of another family member. There seems to be no logic in treating the spouse as deserving more rights than anyone else in the family regarding the tenancy.<br><br>
Most importantly, there is no evidence of the need to make any changes to the current rent Act protection. The proposal contravenes the Government's stated commitment not to undermine existing private tenants' rights. Perhaps Shelter's interpretation of lines 38 to 40 is not on all fours with the Government's interpretation. But the amendment is important on the question of succession and I thing that the Committee can spend a few minutes discussing its ramifications.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 974</span>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would make a first successor other than the spouse of the deceased tenant a statutory tenant instead of a statutory assured tenant. Under existing succession arrangements, someone who succeeds to a regulated tenancy is entitled to a statutory tenancy subject to the regulation provided by the provisions of the Rent (Scotland) Act. That means that the landlord is entitled to receive only the rent registered by the rent officer or rent assessment committee. That is fair enough as long as the rents for all tenancies are subject to such control. But under the assured tenancy arrangements that we are introducing, rents for new lettings will be agreed at market level between landlord and tenant. I do not think that it would be at all fair if a landlord were prevented from receiving the market rent because the new tenancy arose by succession rather than by agreement. That is why we propose that a successor to a regulated tenancy should have a statutory assured tenancy, not a regulated one.<br><br>
The exception in our proposals is, of course, for the spouse of the deceased tenant. She or he will continue to be entitled to a statutory regulated tenancy on the original tenant's death. Only another member of the tenant's family who succeeds to the tenancy will have a statutory assured tenancy. I therefore do not accept the arguments behind amendment No. 487.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that the Minister has dealt with my point. I understand the logic behind the clause and the Minister's statement reinforces that, which is not surprising. However, we are dealing with the right of all first successors to statutory tenancies under the 1984 Act. The amendment seeks to tease from the Government their views on these provisions of the Bill. I shall study what the Minister said, but I am not sure that he has dealt with my point.<br><br>
As we cannot take the argument much further forward, I shall consider what the Minster said and the proposal in the amendment and come back to the matter later, if necessary. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 488, in page 61, leave out lines 6 and 7.<br><br>
The Committee will be relieved to hear that this is the last of this suite of amendments standing in my name. It seeks to preserve the existing right of spouses and family members to qualify as second successors to a statutory or protected tenancy.<br><br>
The Rent (Scotland) Act 1984 permits the passing on of a tenancy to a successor on two occasions. On the death of the original tenant, the tenancy passes in the first instance to the surviving spouse or to a qualifying family member who becomes the first successor. On the death of the first successor, the tenancy at present passes similarly to a second successor. Again, the second successor must be the first successor's spouse or qualifying family member. Thereafter, no more successions can take place.<br><br>
The Bill introduces a significant difference, of which the Committee should be aware, in that the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0614">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 975</span>
qualifying conditions for second successors are changed. The second successor must be not only a member of the first successor's family, but a member of the original tenant's family. Many people will be unfairly excluded from a second succession. For example, a tenant dies and his widow succeeds the tenancy as the first successor. She may remarry but on her death her new husband will have no right to succeed as the second successor as he was not a member of the original tenant's family.<br><br>
I would be obliged if the Minister will confirm whether that analysis of the provisions of the Bill is accurate. If so, that is a serious and fundamental change. There is no reason or justification for altering the current provisions of the 1984 Act in that way. The amendment would ensure that the existing provisions continue to operate for existing private tenants.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman's interpretation is correct. Amendment No. 488 would remove the proposed new requirement that the second successor must have been a member not just of the first successor's family but of the original tenant's family.<br><br>
Amendment No. 488 would allow someone to succeed to a tenancy as second successor, who had no family links with the original tenant. That seems wrong because the successor's right to the tenancy—whether as first or second successor—stems from the tenancy first entered into by the original tenant. That surely means that for someone to have a right to succeed to a regulated tenancy, he must have some direct family link with the original tenant. That is what schedule 6 would achieve, and what amendment No. 488 seeks to prevent.<br><br>
I do not accept the hon. Gentleman's arguments for amendment No. 488, and hope that the Committee will not do so either.</span></p>
<p>10.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Evidently the criteria were all right in 1984 when this Government were in power. All of a sudden they want to make these spiteful little changes to the succession criteria. We have dealt with the timescale and other aspects of this clause and now there is this little twist designed apparently to catch the individual about whom the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood).<br><br>
Will the Minister confirm that if the first successor is the widow of the original tenant and she remarries, brings up a family in that house and dies, her husband cannot succeed to the tenancy and continue to live in that house with their family? Is the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire right? Would such a case be excluded under this provision? That is an entirely pertinent example; it is almost a typical example. Will the Minister confirm whether such a household would face a termination of tenancy?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is correct. Under existing succession rules, a second successor only needs to have been a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 976</span>
member of the first successor's family immediately before the first successor's death in order to succeed to the tenancy. The change proposed under schedule 6 is that the second successor must also have been a member of the original tenant's family immediately before the tenant's death.<br><br>
The reasoning behind the proposal is that as any successor's right to the tenancy stems from the original tenant, it is right to expect any successor, either first or second, to have some family link with that original tenant. The 1984 Act was a consolidation measure; the provision dates back to 1920.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Roberston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: So this provision has been on the statute book since 1920. Was there a Liberal Government then? It has been through the gamut of Administrations—coalitions, Labour and Tory Governments, the whole works. We can safely say that that legislation has passed the test of time.<br><br>
I have never heard anyone complaining about this provision. I am not aware than chartered surveyors or any representative of landlords have complained about the onerous impact of taking on such tenants. Yet this vicious, spiteful, little change is proposed apparently for the hell of it, as a wee sweetie for the landlords. The Tory party can say to landlords, "Look what we have given you, you can sling out tenants, you can refuse to accept successor tenants, you can do more or less what you like, so we hope you will provide new houses to let".<br><br>
Is this change necessary? Has anyone asked for it? Have direct representations been made specifically requesting this change in the law or identifying a problem caused by this law?<br><br>
If the Minister wishes to intervene, I should be delighted to give him the opportunity to put on record any specific representations that have been made to the Government identifying a problem with this provision that has been on the statute book since 1920. As he does not appear to wish to intervene, I can only presume that the idea does not come from a landlord, surveyor or solicitor but from the Government. But what purpose will it serve?<br><br>
The Government proposals that we are probing are extremely harrowing and distasteful. A bereavement is a grim enough experience for any family; to add to that the insecurity of whether a tenant can succeed is intolerable, wrong and totally unnecessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) gave an example of a widow who remarries, but the Minister keeps emphasising—his brief tells him to do so—that there must be a link with the original tenant. He says that the legislation stems from the 1920s, but in 1920 many widows who had lost their husbands in the war will have remarried. If the measure had been in force then, on the death of the first successor—the widow—the landlord could have simply removed the second husband, even though he may have lived in the house for decades as a married individual.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian called the measure mean and spiteful. He is obviously
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0615">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 977</span>
right, as there can be no possible justification for it. It is not good enough for the Minister simply to state blandly that it will improve the housing stock and will give sufficient incentives to landlords. It is a disgraceful measure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Although I agree with the Government's other arguments about the merits of the case, the thing that sticks in my craw and irks me most is that the Government are proposing to change the provisions that have existed since 1920 for all private sector tenants. The Government are perfectly entitled to propose changes to the private sector, and the panoply of provision for assured tenancy. Although I do not necessarily agree with them, it is politically fair game. But the Government assured us that they did not intend to rock the boat in terms of existing rights within the private sector.<br><br>
The provision is a good example of a real change in rights that have existed since 1920. In the depths of schedule 6 the Government are willy-nilly depriving private tenants in Scotland of a fundamental and important right. I object to that. The Government may do as they wish as regards introducing a new scheme, and were right to state at the outset that they would endeavour not to disturb existing rights in the private sector under the 1984 Act and the 1920 Act. But they are certainly not doing so under the schedule.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I believe that someone with direct family links with the original tenant should have succession rights to a regulated tenancy. Therefore, I cannot accept amendment No. 488.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 223, in page 61, line 10, after 'residing', insert 'with the first successor'.<br><br>
The amendment seeks to put beyond doubt the fact that, to be entitled to accede to a tenancy, the successor must have been living with the previous tenant in the house before the required period.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That this schedule, as amended, be the Sixth schedule to the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is one of the most squalid schedules that I have ever seen. Interestingly, few of the details of the schedule were included in the consultation documents, White Papers or press releases connected with the Bill. It has simply been tacked on at the back of the Bill and I suspect that the Government hoped that nobody would notice it.<br><br>
We have debated several detailed aspects of the schedule and have seen the way in which the Government seek to interfere with long-established and perfectly justifiable and reasonable rates of succession of tenants in their family homes. We are not talking about succession to an asset such as a motor car, a piece of land or some chattel, but about
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 978</span>
people's right to stay in the home in which they have grown up or cared for elderly relatives. They may associate directly with the home—if not directly in the legal sense—through the family of the original tenant.<br><br>
As part of the Government's strategy of jettisoning practically everything to encourage private landlords to make more housing available to let, they are nibbling away at protections that have been available to tenants to succeed to their spouses' or families' homes for at least two stages.<br><br>
We have discussed the qualifying period of residence, and the interesting little amendment which would debar a second-stage succession if the successor tenant was not a direct member of the original tenant's family, regardless of the circumstances that we have discussed.<br><br>
The Minister has resolutely refused to say who has specifically asked for such concessions. He has not even said what good he thinks that they will do, but simply sticks to his brief and says that the Government think that the law is far too liberal now so they should make things tougher for the tenants. We do not know whether they simply seek to invigorate the tenants by giving them a tough time, or whether that will be part of the ghastly package of incentives for private landlords in Scotland which will make life much more lucrative for them.<br><br>
We are encountering what resembles a weird fundamentalist religion, in which the Minister is chanting his mantra and saying, "There is going to be more private sector housing available to let as a result of the Government's policies." He hopes that if he says it often enough, we shall believe it, and others might even believe it.<br><br>
The private rented sector has been in decline for a long time. It was in decline in 1920 and even in 1910. It has gone out of fashion. Although we should like to see more houses made available, is it really worth making such sacrifices on the off chance that they might encourage a few more people to let a few more flats?<br><br>
Moreover, have the Government done any research on the matter? What grounds does the Minister have for suggesting that those reductions in tenants' rights to succession will result in there being one additional house to let in Scotland? He is suggesting that a landlord who owns a house will think, "If it wasn't for the fact that that guy's daughter's husband might be able to succeed to the tenancy of the house in 20 or 30 years' time, I would be prepared to let it to him. As it is, it would be safer to leave the house standing empty." That is rubbish. No one will go through such a bizarre thought process.<br><br>
11 p.m.<br><br>
The Minister has not convinced anyone that the schedule will attract one additional house on to the private sector rented market in Scotland. He can have a shot at it now, but I have my doubts. That side of his argument is wrong.<br><br>
The other side of his argument—that there is some way of justifying the additional hardship to tenants—is even more glaringly wrong. As I said a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0616">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 979</span>
few minutes ago, the experience of bereavement in a family or household is bad enough, goodness knows, and we all go through it. The nature of human life is that it comes to an end. People who lost parents, spouses, or other members of their family, have enough problems to contend with—emotional or otherwise—without worrying that they will be put out of their house. Yet that is what the Government are seeking to facilitate.<br><br>
What is the justification for the schedule from the viewpoint of the tenant or the landlord? Who on earth asked for such amendments to the law? What good can they possibly do, even in the Government's rather warped analysis? Given that I see no justification for the schedule—it is a wicked imposition on families—it would be completely wrong to allow it to stand part of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The schedule goes to the heart of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It has no heart.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No one is suggesting that the balance of the schedule is exactly right. It would be a brave politician who claimed that he had everything exactly right. The hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) must understand that there are not nearly enough private sector properties available for let in Scotland. That is one of the ghastly problems that we have had since the end of the war in 1945 and the subsequent changes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Since 1745.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was the continual decline of the private sector that brought about so many of those problems. Many people would be glad to have the opportunity to move and escape the ghastly problems that exist in many Scottish housing estates. The Government want to give people the opportunity to put their capital into properties which can be offered for rent, on a basis that makes such investment attractive. Taking that into account I think that, on balance, we have just about got the provisions right.<br><br>
There are one or two aspects of the schedule about which I have reservations. However, I accept that it is necessary, if we are ever to see real growth in private sector letting.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a clear difference of opinion between the Government and the Opposition on the content of schedule 6. In trying to find a balance, I suggest that the Minister considers implementing schedule 6 later than the other sections of the Bill. Irrespective of what side of the argument we take, schedule 6 will mean fundamental changes. My principal objection is that those changes will affect the long-standing traditional rights of people who have been subject to the rules and regulations governing private sector renting for many a long year.<br><br>
If there is to be a fundamental across-the-board change, people should be given time to adjust to it. If a person dies, the succession provisions will hit the successors in the neck from day one out of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 980</span>
blue. That is unfair on the family members, as well as on those seeking to advise them.<br><br>
I have no time for the schedule, but I accept that the Government have their own ideas about what needs to be done. They argue that the provisions will liberate extra rented accommodation. Whether that is true will be a question of fact and circumstance. The Government used a fair argument in our debate on the schedules to the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Act 1980. If the Government succeed, that is fine. Nevertheless it would cost them not a jot or tittle to implement schedule 6 later. We can argue whether that period should be one, two or five years. The changes suggested are so fundamental that there is a case for implementing schedule 6 by order. Once the dust has settled on the other aspects of the Bill, the Secretary of State should have the power to say when it is time to implement schedule 6.<br><br>
The Minister has already undertaken to consider a five-year period. If he were also prepared to consider delaying the implementation of schedule 6, I would be readier to accept the Government's position. Otherwise, the schedule is not supportable from any point of view. Even the hon. Member for Tayside, (North) (Mr. Walker) says that aspects of the schedule's balance are wrong. That is a signal that something is wrong, if ever there was one. At the very least, the Government should consider implementing the schedule at a later stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not agree with the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) that implementation of the schedule should be delayed. The schedule would be just as bad in the year 2000 as in the year 1988. I am worried about its impact.<br><br>
We must give the Government credit for signalling their intention. Paragraph 4.11 of the White Paper says:
<br><blockquote><p>"It would not be right to disturb these existing tenancies, though minor amendments will be made to the succession rules."</p></blockquote>
I do not regard those amendments as minor. They are significant amendments, which will have a real and lasting effect on the individuals to whom they apply.<br><br>
We have heard the word "incentives" used throughout our proceedings. I am a wee bit depressed at the way that it is rashly assumed that simply removing the rights of tenants will release many houses on to the market. The Minister cannot even tell us how many there will be.<br><br>
There has been no basic research into the demand for private sector rented accommodation. No inquiry has been made into the pressures which may exist in the market and may require changes. There has been no inquiry into the number of houses that may come on to the market as a result of this measure. There is only a gut feeling—a dogma—in the Conservative party that sweeping away tenants' rights will encourage landlords. The Government believe that the only barrier to the development of private housing in Scotland is the rights which tenants enjoy. The Minister has made it clear that some of those rights go back to 1920. If I have got my history right, that was the time of the last Liberal Government, who introduced some restricted protections for tenants.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0617">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 981</span>
There are also incentives on the other side. We must consider the position of the tenant and ask—as we have asked previously in this Committee—what incentive there will be for a tenant to rent the new private houses that will come on to the market I see no incentive. The basic flaw at the heart of this measure is the flaw that results when dogma rules, and legislation is carried out for ideological reasons.<br><br>
There is no incentive for tenants to move into the private rented sector. They will have no protection. We have often contrasted the rights of the public and private sector tenants and there is no comparison. The public sector tenant has written leases, security of tenure and succession on a scale that is quite different from the tenant in the private sector. The Government have made clear their dislike of the public sector. They are anxious to shift as many tenants out of it as possible and to diminish the number of those who remain there. But the incentives are not there for public sector tenants to move into the private sector and this measure will fail.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Tayside, North and the Minister said that the private rented sector needs to be revived and that the restrictions placed on landlords have resulted in the diminution of the private sector over this century. That is nonsense. Two factors are responsible for its decline. The first is the growth of the public sector, which has been the policy of all Governments this century. Since 1920 the building of public housing has been on a grand scale. In the 1951 general election both major parties were almost in an auction promising as many houses as the market could cope with. The Tories finally won with 300,000 a year.<br><br>
Secondly, the number of owner-occupiers has increased. During the past two or three decades there has been much more private house building than previously. Those houses were not built to rent, as they were at the end of the last century, but for sale. There is a demand for them. Most members of the Committee live in a house that they own, although one or two do not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will not be surprised to hear that his arguments sound very similar to those put forward when we discussed the Bill dealing with tenants' rights. I leave the hon. Gentleman with this thought, on which he may wish to comment: if nothing is to happen and nothing is to be created, why is the hon. Gentleman so concerned?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Because people will lose their homes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is a philosopher, among his other talents.<br><br>
I am concerned because those who will be most affected by this legislation are those who will be forced into the private sector. They are the most vulnerable in the community.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: So something will happen?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 982</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It will indeed. The vulnerable sections of the community will suffer. The Government's stated aim is to improve the private rented sector and, if the Government are right, that is supposed to be of immense benefit to private landlords. But there are no real incentives for people to move into the private sector and away from the public sector. There is no good reason for anyone who is not desperate to do that. The other day I used the word "daft" and the hon. Member for Tayside, North said that that would go down like a tombstone.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I said that the hon. Gentleman would live to regret it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I expect to be proved correct. There are no incentives for anyone who is daft enough to take on a short assured tenancy, for example.<br><br>
I said earlier that it would be logical for the Government to try to equalise the private and rented sector and create flexibility by making housing interchangeable so that tenants would see attractions in moving into the private sector. But the fact that houses may be available and come on to the market does not necessarily mean that they will be taken up. People want long-term security. They can get it if they buy their own house or if they move into the public sector, but they will not get it if they move into the private sector.<br><br>
The schedule is a mean and petty example of the flaws in the Bill. The fact that the provision is hidden away in an obscure schedule means that little attention has been focused on it until this evening. Once its contents become general known, people will question the motivation behind the Bill and its likely success. Opposition Members have strong feelings about the schedule.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The logic of the hon. Gentleman's comments is for low-cost home ownership. There are plans along those lines in the area in which the hon. Gentleman lives.<br><br>
There is a misunderstanding among Labour Members who say that the changes will alter tenants' rights. They change the rights of possible successors only.<br><br>
The details of the policy are clearly stated in paragraph 25 of the consultation paper on the private rented sector. I recognise that unfairness could arise if our proposals go through without any change. For example, if a person has been living with a tenant for five months at the Bill's commencement date, 1 April 1989, and the tenant dies a month later, under the existing rules the person has a right to succeed to the tenancy, but under the changed rules he will not. I shall ensure that the new succession rules will not apply to people in such circumstances, but I am not yet sure of the best way to achieve that.<br><br>
11.15 pm.<br><br>
As I have said, schedule 6 contains detailed amendments to schedule 1 of the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984, which changed the succession rules relating to regulated tenancies. We have already discussed the details of the schedule and I believe them to be a reasonable compromise.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One would think that a Government who had just lost 11 of their 21 seats in Scotland would have learnt something. Our debates on the schedule show that they have learnt absolutely nothing. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, West did not have the grace to show any shame about what he is doing. He is content to stick to his guns. Clearly, we shall have to go the whole hog and win the other 10 seats at the next election. The Government are going the right way about it, if this is what they propose to do—<i>[Interruption.]</i> They cannot lose Woodstock, but the rest of them must be in danger.<br><br>
This is not a laughing matter. It is a totally unjustifiable and unwarranted assault on prospective successor tenants in appalling circumstances. I invite the Committee to reject the schedule.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 464, in page 29, leave out line 1.<br><br>
This is quite a simple amendment. Its effect would be to ensure that the decisions of rent assessment committees on rents for assured tenancies would be available to the public on request. That should not be at the discretion of the Secretary of State but as of right. Clause 31(3)(a) details the need to establish whether there is sufficient number of similar tenancies and houses in the locality. Tenants seeking to establish that will be hamstrung if they cannot, as of right, inspect the records of the decisions being made by the rent assessment committees.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sympathetic to the point made by the hon. Member for Edinburgh,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 984</span>
South (Mr. Griffiths). It has always been the Government's firm intention that an order of the type referred to in the clause shall be made. I entirely agree that the information set out in subsection (1) must be made publicly available and that the practical effectiveness of the provisions on referrals to the rent assessment committees will depend on that. In that situation I agree that there is no real reason for making the duty dependent on an order made by my right honourable and learned Friend the Secretary of State. I am happy to tell the hon. Member that the intention behind the amendment.<br><br>
As drafted, however, the amendment is unacceptable because it leaves unchanged later references in the clause to the order and to the information to be specified in it. We will therefore need to preserve a reference to an order-making power without making it a precondition of the performance of the duty. If the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment, I will undertake to come back with an amendment designed for the same purpose at a later stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Could the Minister specify which further references he is making and the effects of them that he feels will be detrimental?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will go into that, and when I came back with the amendment I hope to answer the point thoroughly. It is a drafting matter which needs to be tidied up. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If that is an assurance from the Minister that it is simply a drafting matter and that the impact of the amendment has been accepted, I will happily withdraw it. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I just wanted to welcome the clause. Much has been said about taking powers away from local authorities, but here an important function is being given to them. I hope that local authorities will use this power to the full and that they will monitor and publicise the effects of the Bill without fear of prosecution or intimidation by the Government. It is important to recognise the underlying rights and duties of local authorities in providing housing in their areas. They should have the power to monitor the situation and to advise tenants and landlords, separately if necessary, about their rights and duties under the legislation. I hope that they will be able to do so without let or hindrance from the Government and that sufficient finances will be available for them to carry out this important duty.</span></p>

SAVING FOR COMMON LAW AS TO EFFECT OF NOTICE OF TERMINATION UPON TACIT RELOCATION</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This clause intends to save the common law on tacit relocations. I simply remind the Minister of the commitment that he gave in respect of the notice provisions in clause 29 (4) which attempt to prejudice the common law on tacit relocation. I remind him that we are still awaiting his words on that point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for his comments. We take very seriously the points that were raised in that debate, which was on one of the more complex aspects of the Bill. Clause
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 986</span>
48 is the shortest clause in the Bill. It is designed to ensure that there will be no effect on the common law rule that a notice to quit will bring the operation of tacit relocation to an end at the ish.</span></p>

INTERPRETATION OF PART II</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 483, in page 30, line 17, after '"tenancy"', insert
<br><blockquote><p>'means any agreement under which a house is made available for occupation for human habitation, and'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 484, in Schedule 9, page 64, line 16, at end insert:
<br><blockquote><p>'1A. In section 115(1), in the definition of "tenancy" before "includes" insert "means any agreement under which a house is make available for occupation for human habitation, and".'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am conscious of the fact that I am standing between the Committee and its collective bed. It is an uncomfortable position to be in. So I shall confine my remarks to the minimum. I was casting about in the text of the Bill to find a legitimate way of resolving the problem of licences that provide loopholes from statutory regulations. I pinched a word for the amendment from section 82 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 which seeks to have a similar effect in other legal circumstances, but the Rent Acts and the new private sector tenancies' provisions are confined to leases.<br><br>
11.30 pm<br><br>
Exploitation by landlords is common in the central industrial belt and in places such as Dundee. They have tried to designate agreements with their tenants as licences and, thereby, escape the statutory regulations. That unpleasant device is sued with varying degrees of success, but always with the motive of evading the statutory protection afforded to tenants by legislation. I tabled the amendment in this form to seek a short discussion on the subject, but perhaps it is neither the right time of day nor the appropriate clause to have such a discussion. It is an important amendment and we should spend some time considering the Government's reply.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment of the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood). The words suggested are fairly simple. I do not think that landlords will have to get up to such tricks and devices, because the Bill gives them all the latitude that they need. However, we should still note that licences have become almost institutionalised in some parts of the country, especially Dundee. They have also led to much litigation, which we wish to stop.<br><br>
Landlords have made some foolish mistakes when applying for licences to avoid their responsibilities
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0620">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 987</span>
under the Rent Acts. Many landlords have found it dificult to find another word, other than rent for the payment of money. The courts have studied licence applications carefully. I have seen counsel's opinion on different types of licence. They are insidious and an attempt to avoid the provisions of the Rent Acts. This simple amendment would stamp out one glaring opportunity for landlords to abuse even this concessionary measure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A licence is a term used to mean permission to occupy, which falls short of being a lease. When tenancies purporting to be licences have been brought to our attention, the rent officer has taken a robust view and treated the case as a tenancy. The rent officer's view in all such cases has never been challenged.<br><br>
I cannot accept the principle of the amendments. I have already explained my reasons during our debate on clause 14, and I shall not repeat them.<br><br>
Briefly, however, the amendments would overturn the important principle of common law that a lease requires exclusive occupation of some premises. As I have already explained, we cannot simply abandon that restriction, because it is very important and gives important protection to many people. If the amendments were accepted, any agreement for occupation of a house which includes, in effect, any fixed structure, in which people may live would become a lease. As a result of amendment No. 483, any such agreement would become an assured tenancy, and as a result of amendment No. 484, any such agreement would become a protected tenancy.<br><br>
Although I sympathise with the intention behind the amendments, the practical result would be nonsense. Anyone occupying a hostel, a hotel or boarding-house—perhaps even a friend who stays overnight—would become a protected tenant or an assured tenant, to whom the full apparatus of the 1984 Act or the Bill would apply.</span></p>
