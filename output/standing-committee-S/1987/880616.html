	<time>Thursday 16 June 1988</time>
	<p>[MR. MICHAEL J. MARTIN 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Civil Evidence (Scotland) Bill [Lords]</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That during the proceedings on the Civil Evidence (Scotland) Bill [	<i>Lords</i>] the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock.—[	<i>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Garscadden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no intention of debating the sittings motion, which is in standard form and reasonable. This is an interesting little Bill. The hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro) said on Second Reading that clause 9 would be contentious and require hard scrutiny, especially the definition of "civil proceedings". That shows that we have many unexpected happenings ahead of us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is not contentious, but it raises important points. The Minister's proposal is reasonable, and I am happy to support it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Under Standing Order No. 87 Law Officers can attend a Committee even if they are not members, but it says that they must be Members of the House—presumably the House of Commons. That is important, as this is a technical Bill. My claims to being knowledgeable on the law have long died with desuetude. One or two of my hon. Friends have no particular specialist knowledge, although we are glad that my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Darling) is here, as he is, perhaps, less rusty in these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Solicitor-General for Scotland, Mr. Peter Fraser could have made a useful contribution to our proceedings, but he fell in the field in the last general election. As the Bill contains references to commencement orders that the Lord Advocate—a Law Officer—will lay is it possible for the Law Officers to be present? The Lord Advocate is a Member of Parliament, in the broader sense as he is a member in another place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no possibility of that because to attend a Committee the Law Officer must be a Member of the House of Commons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw the Committee's attention to the fact that adequate notice should be given of amendments. As a general rule, I do not intend to call starred amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 1</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>RULE REQUIRING CORROBORATION ABOLISHED</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 1 is very important and of considerable general interest. As I am suffering from
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
seasonable hay fever, I apologise if my remarks are dramatically punctuated by what look like seizures. In case anyone has unreasonable hopes, I must say that recovery is almost certain after a decent interval.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome to our midst the hon. Member for Bosworth (Mr. Tredinnick). It is becoming a tradition to welcome in personal terms unexpected, but not necessarily unwelcome, faces. We do not like the reason that the hon. Gentleman had to be pressed into service. No doubt his education at Eton, the Mons Officer Cadet school and the business school at Capetown university qualify him admirably and will give him the necessary discipline to last through a Scottish law reform Bill Committee. I advise the hon. Gentleman, in the most friendly way, that he should not show too much distinction and style in this Committee because otherwise he may well be called upon to serve on many future Committees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Tredinnick 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bosworth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) for welcoming me to the Committee, especially as, being a Cornishman and a Celt, I have so much in common with the Scots. Perhaps my seat of Bosworth is representative of things to come in Scotland, because my predecessor turned what was once a safe Labour seat into a safe Conservative seat.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Woodrow Wyatt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not be tempted to pursue that point, Mr. Martin, because although you are a tolerant Chairman, you might take exception to a debate about the merits of Mr. Woodrow Wyatt and his ideological position. I am not sure about where Bosworth is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was a battlefield.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but I am not sure whether it is within the Celtic hegemony, either historically or actually, so I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on having carpetbagged so successfully in getting that particular seat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1 deals with the abolition of corroboration. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) made an extremely long speech when he opened the Second Reading debate. It was one of his more memorable efforts, although not one that we shall remember with affection. There is a certain amount of affection for the Minister—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He is a constituent of mine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. The Minister spoke on the clause for 47 minutes, yet managed to answer very few of the questions arising from it. It would be useful if he took the opportunity to do so now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are approaching the clause in a fairly constructive spirit and have not attempted to amend it. To do so would have required some determined malice and would have meant the Committee being unnaturally prolonged. We accept that there is a case for change, which was made succinctly in the Scottish Law Commission's report on corroboration, hearsay and related matters. We shall no doubt deal with hearsay and related matters at future Committee sittings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that there is a case for abandoning corroboration in civil actions, especially in the light of the important exception created in section 9 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1968,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0009">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
which featured in the Second Reading debate. My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Darling) may have some thoughts, but I think that corroboration has undoubtedly become a case of intellectual ingenuity in civil proofs. We have almost reached the stage where anything will do, and that is not necessarily satisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My little clutch of legal knowledge has been much depleted by time, but I am sorry that O'Hara 	<i>v.</i> Central SMT Co. Ltd. has, in effect, disappeared from the law books. Along with the snail in the bottle and Donoghue 	<i>v.</i> Stevenson, I classed it as a case that every apprentice, first year or otherwise, would know about. It seems rather a shame that something so familiar will disappear. For all that, times change, and the case has been well made by the Scottish Law Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one point on which I should like the Minister's comments. On Second Reading there was some debate about the exchanges in the Scottish Grand Committee on 19 March 1968 when Lord Wylie was speaking on behalf of the then Conservative Opposition. A much respected and liked Member of the House, Norman Wylie—as he then was—made it clear that he opposed root and branch the section 9 proposals that exempted certain categories, particularly actions for personal injury, from normal corroboration rules. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"These are provisions to which as a Scottish lawyer I take the strongest possible exception."</p></blockquote>
Those who know Norman Wylie know that he does not take the strongest possible exception to most matters. He is characteristically a man of balance who sees not in black or white, but in shades of grey. That is a virtue in a court of session judge, if not in a Conservative politician, it was unusual for him to use such strong language. He followed that by voting against the clause in the clause stand part debate of the Committee proceedings on the 1968 Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Norman Wylie did not base his argument just on principle, although he did that at length and with much learning. It might worry the 	<i>Hansard</i> reporters if his remarks were repeated. He also argued in the Scottish Grand Committee in 1968 that
	<br><blockquote><p>"In my career of fifteen or sixteen years at the Bar I can only think of one case in which I had to advise that there was insufficient evidence to enable an action to be raised, and having regard to the later decisions of Cleisham 	<i>v</i> the British Transport Commission I would certainly not have given that advice today."—[	<i>Official Report, Scottish Grand Committee,</i> 19 March 1968; c. 25.]</p></blockquote>
Paragraph 2.8 of the Scottish Law Commission report, which forms the basis of the debate, deals with that argument. It reaches a different conclusion from that of Norman Wylie:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It might, of course, be said"—</p></blockquote>
it was, and that is the point—
	<br><blockquote><p>"that as corroboration can, where necessary, be found so readily, the retention of the requirement does little harm. Cases are not difficult to find, nonetheless, in which the Court has regretfully been compelled to find for a party by reason of the failure of the other party to find corroboration. However, we think that a better conclusion is that while on the one hand the requirement may be an impediment to justice, on the other it scarcely serves any useful purpose."</p></blockquote>
Unlike Norman Wylie, Lord Maxwell and his colleagues concluded that people have been denied justice in a significant number of cases. I presume, although the Minister may want to say something about it, that he would repudiate Lord Wylie's views that there is no
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
difficulty in establishing the case, even within the present rules of corroboration. Perhaps the Minister will comment on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The experience of section 9 procedures clinches the argument for the Opposition. In paragraph 2.10 of its report, the Law Commission made it clear that no one who gave evidence then wanted to go back to where corroboration applied in actions of personal injury. Recent experience suggests that that innovation worked well and so there is a persuasive case for extending it. We support the clause on that broad principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred with erudition to Thomson 	<i>v.</i> Tough Ropes Ltd., which is mentioned in a footnote in the Law Commission report. It sounds intriguing—
	<br><blockquote><p>"the pursuer was … successful on the basis of uncorroborated evidence, even though her evidence was contradicted by that of the only eye-witness."</p></blockquote>
That seems a pretty brave piece of credibility rating by the judge. This morning I tried to consult the notes on Thomson 	<i>v.</i> Tough Ropes Ltd., in a 1978 edition of the 	<i>Scots Law Times,</i> but the Library does not have a set of the 	<i>Scots Law Times.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alistair Darling 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is very difficult to obtain any Scottish legal textbook or session cases. Most of them are kept in the House of Lords Library. Those responsible for the Library should consider that fact, as most of the corresponding English books are readily available. It places some of us at a disadvantage because we have to go to the Advocate's Library or somewhere similar in Scotland or to the House of Lords.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that it is a problem. I thought that my hon. Friend was about to say that he had appeared in Thomson 	<i>v.</i> Tough Ropes Ltd. and could help us with our difficulty. I shall not labour the point, but this morning I tried to find a copy of "Renton and Brown" but, remarkably, the Library did not have one. However, we can take up that point with the Library Sub-Committee and strike a modest blow for the provision of information on legal matters to uninstructed Scottish Members, of whom, I fear, there are many.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tribute was paid to my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, South (Mr. Buchan) who piloted section 9 through the Committee and Repot stages in 1968. He should be congratulated for its great success. I cannot resist saying, as I did on Second Reading, that in 1968 the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro) voted against section 9, and he was good enough to say so during the Second Reading debate. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As a dutiful Whip, it was my duty to ensure that everyone supported the then Opposition. Twenty years later, after much consultation and further experience, if my hon. Friend the Minister now takes a different view I am sure that it is the result of experience in the courts and I am thus quite happy that there should be a change of attitude."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 16 May 1988; Vol. 133, c. 755.]</p></blockquote>
That is unsatisfactory. I do not know whether this legislation is the result of experience in the courts of the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, who is modestly shaking his head. I should be interested to hear whether the hon. Member for Dumfries is still acting as a dutiful Back Bencher, if not a dutiful Whip, or whether he believes that he was right in his attitude to section 9 so long ago. In my experience, old men do not forget; they remember
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0010">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
with appalling clarity what happened a long time ago. The hon. Gentleman may want to say something about his earlier attitude.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to question the Minister a little further about paragraph 2.9 of the Scottish Law Commission's report, which fairly states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A further criticism of the present law which has been made to us by some commentators and which we think of considerable practical importance is that the requirement can lead to unnecessary expense, delays and inconvenience."</p></blockquote>
That is a reference to the need to provide corroborated evidence at every point in the evidential chain, which is built to try to establish the case of one of the parties to an action. I referred to that paragraph earlier as I was not entirely satisfied with the Minister's reply. I am very interested in the impact on the likely availability and cost of the legal aid scheme. It may be comparatively marginal, but presumably some cases in which probabalis causa has not been established and which come before the legal aid authorities—now the Scottish Legal Aid Board—will now get through the net and qualify for legal aid. That will have an impact, albeit a minor one, on the cost of the legal aid scheme.

Civil expenditure in 1986–87 was running at about £14·5 million for solicitors and counsels' fees and outlays. The Minister should say a little more about that because the changes in the legal aid system have caused concern and sensitivity. Concern has been expressed not only by those with vested interests in the legal world, but by a wide spread of legal opinion about the fact that work done before legal aid is granted cannot be covered by the legal aid fund, and that substantial delays are bound to result. It is not as if the Government save money; if the action goes ahead, the work must be done and paid for. If legal advisers are confident that they will receive legal aid however, they often carry out necessary preliminary work as soon as the application has been launched, to get matters moving. To do so is in the interests of the system because delays bring it into disrepute. Unfortunately, legal advisers may find that they are left without the remedy of a legal aid grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the issue was under consideration and that he was in touch with the Law Society about it. He may not have anything further to say after such a short interval, but I thought that I should raise the matter with him and invite him to make any comments that he feels are appropriate and proper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not expect the Minister to make a major statement, but will he comment on the Government's plans to try to reduce, as stated in paragraph 2·9 of the report of the Scottish Law Commission,
	<br><blockquote><p>"unnecessary expense, delays and inconvenience."?</p></blockquote>
There is now great anxiety about the cost of litigation. For instance, a report appeared in the Scottish press on Friday, 3 June 1988—it was in the 	<i>Glasgow Herald,</i> but it may have appeared in any of the major Scottish papers—about a case in which an out-of-court settlement was made in an action for damages against the Strathclyde police. The police committee had wished to contest the action, which was for £250,000, but the insurers settled out of court, as they were entitled to do under the policy. A contested proof in the Court of Session was so horrifically expensive that they were prepared to say, "It does not matter about the merits of the action, we intend to settle it because it will be cheap at the price."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
That example illustrates the position that we have reached. It involved a disturbance at a public house; the pursuers in the civil action claimed that they were severely assaulted by the police and the police strongly denied it. Surely there would have been public interest in such a case going to proof. If the case had succeeded on its merits, there would have been an important matter to take up by the police authorities. If it had not succeeded, the police would have been exonerated and the case would have been publicised. Instead, the insurance company considered the massive cost of civil litigation and decided to throw in the towel and settle for an extrajudicial payment, the amount of which has not been revealed. The Strathclyde police committee and my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Rutherglen (Mr. McAvoy) who, I suspect, has had direct experience of that committee, were left in disarray and dismay. That case is a measure of the proper concern about the cost of civil litigation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that clause 1 will greatly affect the costs, delay or expense, although the commission argued that it would make a contribution. Will the Minister comment on that? On 7 June the Lord Chancellor's Department made an important announcement on the civil justice review, which was an attempt to do exactly what is proposed here in civil cases in England. It would press the Committee's tolerance to go through that at length, but the report recommends reforms to reduce the cost of litigation. Not all are attractive. For example, one means would be:
	<br><blockquote><p>"advertisement of fees or hourly rates by counsel and solicitors, as a means of cutting the cost of legal action for individual litigants."</p></blockquote>
I wonder whether my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Darling) would like a small notice attached to counsel's box in Parliament House saying, "I'll do it for 10 per cent. less than Bloggs, QC. My hourly rate is £x. Trust honest whoever it might be." I shall not pick a name in case it is interpreted as pejorative and as pointing a finger at others. That would be controversial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a major report for England. The Bill deals with similar problems and it represents a major argument in favour of the proposed reforms set out in the report. That report touches the edge of our deliberations and I hope that the Minister will say something about the need for it. There is a case for looking at court procedures and the endless days, weeks and months on the adjustment role while pleadings are tinkered with. There is also a case for simplification and for cutting the expense and delay that inevitably arises from the process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be ironic if the noble and learned Lord Mackay of Clashfern—a free Presbyterian—introduced major and widespread reforms in England when he did not achieve a similar impact while he was Lord Advocate in Scotland. The Minister should outline the Government's plans in this respect and comment on the need to make further progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill applies to civil actions only, but once one starts eating into safeguards there is a danger of moving on to other matters. I shall not use the phrase "slippery slope", because that has connotations from other areas of political debate that are not relevant, but we may be in danger of exerting more pressure and challenging, in a minor way, the safeguards that appear in other parts of the court system, especially in criminal matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps it is unnecessary to ask for an assurance, but my attention was drawn by my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Central to a memorandum from the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0011">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
Scottish Law Agents Society, which is worried about the steady erosion of Scots law and corroboration. It is prepared to accept the clause but says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We believe that the Lord Advocate"—</p></blockquote>
unfortunately he is not with us so we shall have to make do with his alternate, the Under-Secretary—
	<br><blockquote><p>"should be asked for a firm assurance that there is no intention to extend this and to erode further the necessity of corroboration in criminal cases."</p></blockquote>
That is a reasonable request to put on the record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many years ago, when I took an interest in such matters, the great curiosity was section 22 of the Road Traffic Act 1972 which, for those who do not know and have not been charged under it, is failing to stop at a red light. Section 22(4) of that Act makes the special exception that it is possible to get a conviction on the evidence of a single witness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
That has stood out as a curiosity in the law of Scotland and we want it to remain a curiosity. I promised that I would not rehearse Norman Wylie's legal arguments, but in the dim days of 1968 he pointed out that the law of corroboration had, in practice, been slightly eroded. Someone may enter a speed trap at one end and come out at the other end, the readings at each end having been taken by only one policeman. I have never been accused of being a purist, but a purist might say that there should be corroborated evidence for both parts of the speed trap to establish the chain. The courts have never taken that view. My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Central is making a terrible face at me, but that argument was adduced by a distinguished member of the Court of Session bench.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to clarify my facial expression. I was surprised at my hon. Friend's unduly narrow definition of how one corroborates evidence in criminal cases. I was certainly not criticising Lord Wylie, especially as one day I may appear before him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is typical of my hon. Friend's meticulous preparation that he considers that possibility. I am totally confident about his electoral prospects and I am sure that he will escape the necessity of appearing before Lord Anyone in his professional capacity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a climate—which I have supported so I plead guilty to being part of the trend—in which we have tended, in the interests of expediency, to weaken the safeguards. For example, I alone expressed reservations on the procurator fiscal fining system when it recently appeared in statute, although I supported it generally as a means of diverting from court and relieving the pressure. A number of justices of the peace have written to me fiercely arguing that it is asking the procurator fiscal to act in a semi-judicial capacity. If a person can pay the set penalty—I cannot remember whether it is £25 or £50—he may escape a conviction because if he has the wherewithall he can ensure that no more formal proceedings are taken by the procurator fiscal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such matters are open to argument but there is a public convenience. Let us consider parking wardens. Recently we took away the need for corroboration for that familiar part of the street life in Scotland where two stout-hearted and stout-bodied buddies may be seen walking around recording the names of those in default—that is a nice
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
neutral term. That is a loosening of the traditional severe standards of corroboration in criminal matters. Such a trend could take hold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been debates about the right to silence and whether that should be removed. That is one of the great, classic safeguards in our criminal courts. Many of us argued that it should be removed under the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1987 when it came to judicial examination. I remember delaying that Committee for many hours arguing that point. I lost to the big battalions, as so often happens to me. Against that background it is fair to ask the Minister to give an assurance and get it on the record before we pass on from clause 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to go on interminably so I shall just say a word or two in conclusion about subsection (2), which removes corroboration by false denial. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Any rule of law whereby any evidence may be taken to be corroborated by a false denial shall cease to have effect."</p></blockquote>
There was little discussion about that on Second Reading for reasons that I can understand. Few tears will be shed over the removal of corroboration by false denial. The Scottish Law Commission dispatched it from the living law to the limbo of academic law, devoting only one paragraph, paragraph 2.16, to the subject. Few of us will worry over what was described, in connection with a 1934 case, as:
	<br><blockquote><p>"'at best a doubtful doctrine'"</p></blockquote>
The only justification for corroboration by false denial was that, by definition, the act that was subject to inquiry was likely to have been conducted in private—it would be remarkable if it had not been—so the likelihood of having corroborating witnesses was remote. It may be that fact and circumstance would make good the lack, but there could be difficulties with corroborating evidence. Thus, the unusual practice arose by which, if the defender in the witness box denied a material fact which was proved to be true, that was then accepted as corroboration of the pursuer's evidence as to a child's paternity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right that that practice should go and that corroboration is no longer necessary. It would be unusual if a judgment were made on credibility, and it would be a brave man who would make it without corroboration of any kind. It is right to simplify and get rid of an archaic and unpleasant doctrine that has hung around from a previous age.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have come across a quotation that reminds me of what happened in the old days and which deals with the problem of bastardy—I use the word as a technical term.
	<br><blockquote><p>"Bastardy hath no effect till declarator, which proceeds upon a general citation against all and sundry, at the market-cross of the shire where the bastard dwelt".</p></blockquote>
That is a primitive way of dealing with such issues, but there are echoes of it in the concept of corroboration by false denial. Therefore, I welcome the fact that it should go.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should perhaps conclude this set of remarks—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumfries)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I detect a sign of life from the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a significant clause. Sometimes, because matters are technical, we think that we can nod them through, and that they are not important. The Scottish Law Agents Society memorandum states that if the rule on hearsay and the need for corroboration should be relaxed, it would be with:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0012">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"the necessary implication that a case could be proven by a single piece of hearsay evidence."</p></blockquote>
That is alarmist, but it underlines the importance of the issue. After all, the court does not need to accept hearsay or uncorroborated evidence. It must still be satisfied that the case has been proved in a civil action on the balance of probabilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reading between the lines, some of the Scottish Law Agents Society's concern lies in the fact that it is not sure that a civil jury can make such judgments and apportion the appropriate weight to the evidence that may be before it. However, civil juries are rare—no doubt the Minister has the figure at his fingertips—and their demise is under consideration. It is unfair to think that the Minister will have anything more to say on that, but Lord Cameron of Lochbroom made it clear in the House of Lords that the fate of civil juries was being considered. I was surprised that the hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East (Mr. Campbell) seemed to think that they were an important part of the Scottish legal scene. The hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh), who represents the minority parties in the Committee, may want to take up that point later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Doubts about civil juries are not a good reason for taking a reactionary view on the need for change. I am prepared to go along with the notes on clauses, which I inadvertently quoted:
	<br><blockquote><p>"However, the Court will still retain its power to accord appropriate weight to the evidence put before it."</p></blockquote>
It is very much a matter of trusting the system of justice and the common sense of the courts not to go to the extreme and decide a case on the single piece of hearsay evidence to which the Scottish Law Agents Society refer, no doubt simply to make a point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lord Ross of Marnock made it clear during a debate on the 1968 Bill that the courts should try to get at the truth in an untrammelled and sensible way and should establish the facts. Willie Ross always put it extremely eloquently and what he said in 1968 still holds good. It should be at the back of all our minds when considering such Bills, but on balance, I am satisfied that the proposal in clause 1 will assist and not hinder that process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should comment on the general principles behind the clause and assure the Committee that it will not be seen as a way to open floodgates that may sweep away essential safeguards in other parts of the legal system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alistair Darling 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to take up a point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) towards the conclusion of his wide-ranging and comprehensive critique of the Bill—the effect of clause 1(2), which would abolish the rule of corroboration by false denial. Many law students have been confident that it has been necessary to know only one case of the corroboration by false denial—that of Davies 	<i>v.</i> Hunter because, as far as I am aware, that is the only case. The examination question was:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Explain the circumstances in which it is competent to lead to corroboration by false denial."</p></blockquote>
It was easy to rehearse the facts in Davies 	<i>v.</i> Hunter and get some marks before tackling the more difficult and prosaic questions on which one might be examined. Future law students will be sorry that corroboration by false denial is to be abolished, although I agree that there is no
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
justification for maintaining it. At best, it was a doubtful document and it is no great sorrow that it is passing from Scottish law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The more substantial part and effect of clause 1 concerns the abolition of the rule requiring corroboration. Lord Morton of Shuna amended the Bill when it was in another place, so our role as Opposition is not as onerous as it might otherwise have been. As my hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden said, we broadly welcome the Bill, but we have one or two reservations and questions. I do not think that we should be jumping for joy and suggesting that the legislation will make life a great deal easier for litigants—people who wish to raise actions—especially where reparation is involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my experience, and that of anyone who knows about reparation, corroboration is but one small difficulty in succeeding in a reparation action. As well as having to corroborate under the present law, one must also prove the causal connection to establish fault. That is just part of the difficulty that people face.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the example of a man who wishes to raise an action for reparation on the grounds that, through the fault of his former employer, he contracted asbestosis or some other lung disease. There has of late been a great deal of controversy regarding people who suffer from asbestosis. Indeed, the Edinburgh 	<i>Evening News</i> ran a very good campaign highlighting the difficulties faced by people who simply cannot succeed in getting their damages, not just because of the difficulties presented by corroboration, but because they have to prove fault. The merits of having to prove fault are, perhaps, beyond the remit of the Committee, but none the less it is important to canvass the issue. I do not want to anticipate the Minister, but he may say that this is a breakthrough and that those seeking damages may find their path easier. I do not necessarily share such optimism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first difficulty faced by someone raising an action based on an employer's fault is finding that employer. Obviously, abolishing corroboration will help, because it may not be necessary to find two people to prove that the employee was at a particular place at a particular time and that there was an emission of asbestos dust. But the person raising the action must still prove that there was fault. That is difficult when 20 years or 30 years may have elapsed since the time of the alleged contact with the asbestos. It must be proved that the employer was at fault regarding something that he did not do some 20 or 30 years earlier. The Bill does not tackle that problem. It must also be proved that the employer should have foreseen that an act of omission would lead to the injury subsequently sustained by the person pursuing the claim. That can be very difficult to prove with such a lapse of time, and the Bill does not deal with that problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This may be slightly outwith the scope of the Committee, as we are dealing with civil evidence, but I should like the Minister to consider the possibility of instituting a scheme that would allow no-fault liability. Other countries—Australia and New Zealand spring to mind, but I forget exactly which—have a no-fault liability scheme. It is not without its difficulties, but I believe that such a scheme, more than this Bill, would do a great deal to help cases where people have obviously suffered a wrong or been injured but it is not easy to determine whose fault it was.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0013">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
The scheme that I have in mind would allow someone who had contracted asbestosis or been injured to be compensated. I think that we all accept that someone who has been injured and is often suffering substantial pain should be compensated and looked after by a state fund. The scheme would still leave the way open for the state fund to proceed against the former employer who caused the injury by an act or omission. My scheme would allow someone who had been injured,—especially someone who had a particularly unpleasant disease like asbestosis—to get compensation and live out the rest of his life with dignity, and at the same time allow the state, which is in a better position financially, to proceed against the employer. If the Minister dealt with that problem, he could indeed stand up and say, "Here is a charter for injured people".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill deals only with evidence, but much more work needs to be done. We should pride ourselves on getting agreement on no-fault liability to establish a charter for injured people to enable them to get compensation and live out the rest of their lives with the care and comfort they need and without the worry, expense and strain of pursuing an action of damages against a former employer or whomever.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unless no-fault liability is seriously considered, we shall always have the problem of a litigant who goes to court and corroborates the facts and circumstances that he sought to prove, but falls down on the final and vital hurdle of proving causal connection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I acted in a case for someone who was injured on a building site. We had considerable difficulty corroborating what had happened, but we managed to do it on a wing and a prayer. The sheriff was satisfied that we had proved the facts of the case but we fell down on the causal connection. That is a problem. That man pursued the case for four or five years. He had to fund it himself because he fell on just the wrong side of the legal aid hurdle. He lost a considerable amount of money, went through a great deal of stress and the tragedy was that there was no dispute. The sheriff made that clear. That injured man will be in pain for the rest of his life and nothing was done to help him. He will have to rely on miserable state benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill will help people like him and cut down some of the expense of seeking corroboration and carrying out the solicitor's work. However, it does not cover that extra bit. The Minister should agree to examine carefully the question of no-fault liability because anything short of that will be a severe blow, especially to the special category of people who suffer from lung-associated diseases because they are at a severe disadvantage. Everything goes against them, even if they can prove what disease they have, which is a major hurdle. The Bill may help in that it will not be necessary to corroborate what the person suffers from, but in asbestos cases, for example it is difficult to get two doctors to agree. Often the doctor acting for the pursuer says one thing and the doctor acting for the defender says something else. That is heart rending and I hope that the Government will pay attention to that problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden said, corroboration in civil actions was substantially eroded in 1968 and he mentioned section 9. The Bill vindicates section 9 and we are now going the whole hog and removing the need for corroboration. That is a valuable
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
step, but I assume that the case law that followed the passing of section 9—the Minister is aware of many cases that were decided in the Court of Session in the early 1970s—made it clear that while the necessity for corroboration was abolished, that did not mean that the court has to accept the word of a single witness to establish a fact. The question of credibility remains and there is still an onus on any counsel presenting a case before any forum in Scotland to lead evidence, even if it tends to go against the proposition or his client's point of view. If the pursuer says one thing and 25 witnesses all say another, no one should think that the word of those 25 witnesses counts for nothing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The notes on clauses referring to subsection (1) state:
	<br><blockquote><p>"'Civil proceedings' is denned in clause 9 to include, essentially, any civil proceedings before the ordinary courts of law and proceedings before tribunals, inquiries and arbitrations."</p></blockquote>
That brings to mind relatively minor cases such as tribunals about social security claims. It is worrying that the sweeping away of the law of corroboration will make it too easy for a DHSS inspector or snoop to say that so and so was picking tatties in a tattie field and for that uncorroborated evidence to be upheld in such a tribunal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has raised a problem. I wish the Minister to assure us that the Bill is not designed to achieve the effect that my hon. Friend described. When one witness says one thing and another says something different, it is always difficult to discover who is telling the truth. I hope that whoever presents the case will leave all the competently put evidence before the court so that the court can decide on matters of credibility. It would be very worrying if we were to say that the word of one person was sufficient and that other witnesses who would not corroborate it should be shuffled off into the background, which has happened. During criminal proceedings, it is not uncommon for witnesses for the defence to shuffle off as the evidence becomes more and more damning. I remember one case in which, during a legal debate, reference was made to a defence witness who was appearing as a character witness. The police attempted to talk to him but discovered that he had taken a short break overseas. However, that is an aside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although corroboration is to be abolished, the courts will still be entitled to evaluate all the evidence put before them. People have a duty to adduce all the available evidence so that the court can reach a sensible solution. Justice must not be undermined, but must always be seen to be done. In 99·9 per cent. of damages cases, I err on the side of the pursuer as the odds are stacked against him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to have a fair system. The mountain that the pursuer has to climb is formidable and although the abolition of corroboration is a welcome step, it is only a small one. Many people in Scotland and elsewhere in the United Kingdom suffer great injustices because they were unable to prove whose fault it was, that the fault caused the injury complained of and that the person responsible for the act of omission should have foreseen it. That is a formidable hurdle. The abolition of corroboration will help, but it will not solve the problem. It is not right that some citizens suffer—sometimes in horrible pain—because they are up against defenders who can afford to shuffle this way and that and blame someone else. I return to the asbestos cases. Often, the company originally said
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0014">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
to be responsible for causing the harm has gone out of business or denies responsibility. It is very difficult to prove liability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue of corroboration in civil cases is largely uncontentious. However, I wish to support my hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden, who said that we are seeking nothing less than a categorical assurance that the law that requires corroboration in criminal cases will not be affected. Some of the Ministers' utterances worry us, particularly in the light of the unfortunate events in Germany this week. The "Hang 'em and flog 'em" brigade, which makes up the majority of Conservative Members—those who shout first and think much later—might not baulk at removing the law that requires corroboration in criminal cases. They would be happy to see it go, except if somebody they knew was affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Government assure us that they will not contemplate abolishing corroboration in criminal cases, because that would remove from our society the status of being civilised and just, and turn it into a totalitarian and barbaric one? None of us would tolerate that. I should like the Minister to understand that we shall be very angry if he again fails to give a complete and categorical denial that the Government intend to contemplate such a measure. I am not sure with how much authority the Minister can speak, as his boss is not here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has more civil servants than Back Benchers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend says, not many Conservative Members are present, which is disappointing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Corroboration is also important when one considers the expense that a litigant must undertake, and it is especially important when it comes to legal aid. As the Minister is aware—we canvassed this point when we discussed the legal aid regulations a short time ago—before legal aid can be obtained, one must establish that one has probable cause for litigation. To do that, precognitions from potential witnesses must be obtained, to satisfy the legal aid committee that one has corroboration of the facts that are necessary to prove the case. To abolish corroboration is a welcome step because it will reduce some of the expense and delay that often surrounds an action of damages. Indeed, solicitors are often up against the expiry of the triennium. When consulted by their clients, they must then obtain precognitions from two, three or four witnesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I just hope that members of the public are aware that, although solicitors' work will be easier, they will have the hurdle of obtaining legal aid. To discuss legal aid would stretch your patience, Mr. Martin, but when we last discussed it, the Minister kindly invited us to canvass all the problems involved. However, he did not expect a barrage from both sides of the Committee. May I tell him that the Scottish Legal Aid Board's position is not getting better, but is getting worse, and I am now receiving many complaints?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I hope that, as well as helping would-be litigants on corroboration, the Minister will also realise that the Scottish Legal Aid Board is a Government responsibility. The Government cannot pretend that it is an independent organisation and does not concern them. Manifest injustices are occurring because of gross delays.
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
I feel sorry for the Scottish Legal Aid Board staff, as it is not their fault. It is high time that the Government accepted that a problem exists and acted on that. It is difficult to get litigation under way and many hurdles must be crossed before someone can get an action under way. That adds strength to my argument that we should examine no-fault liability. Many people are put to unnecessary expense. Moreover, those who will not receive legal aid, or who will fall on the boundary between having to pay a substantial contribution and having to pay everything themselves, will be pleased.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not mind the odd remark about legal aid, but the Bill is not about legal aid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that, Mr. Martin. Just before you stood up, I was about to leave legal aid and go on to the cost of litigation, which is affected by the issues under discussion today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the fact that the Bill will reduce prelitigation as well as litigation costs for those having to fund actions themselves. For those who are publicly funded, it will also save the state money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition generally welcome the Bill, provided that we get the safeguards that we have sought on criminal matters and on the courts' ability to examine all evidence before reaching a decision about whether the necessary facts are proved. But I want the Minister to go further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Law Commission has done sterling work in revising and simplifying Scottish law. It has considered, but not examined, the issue of no-fault liability. If it were to do so, that would be a worthy addition and a godsend to many who have suffered a wrong that should be put right—which is what Parliament is all about. If the Minister does not examine that issue, it will be a slap in the face to many who look to the Government to provide relief. That should be a priority and not, as happens often, a clearing-up operation arising from a report of the Scottish Law Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will respond positively, although I fear that he may have to listen to the Scottish National party's view before he has an opportunity to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Angus, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the arguments about the Scottish Legal Aid Board and the problems throughout Scotland for litigants. I hope that the Minister will deal with that. I agree also that the proposed corroboration changes in the Bill should not be extended into criminal cases. Opposition Members are unanimous on that. While the proposed changes are acceptable and may be justified in the different circumstances of civil cases, they would be inappropriate in criminal cases. Will the Minister respond today to those two important issues?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far we have had the professionals; now it is the turn of the amateurs, who, I assure the Minister, will be briefer at least.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far in our debate, the doctrine of false denial has been dismissed as outdated, trivial and good only as an easy examination question. The Bill ensures its demise, but before it goes I should like to draw to the Minister's attention the anxiety of one of my local solicitors about clause 1(2), which he relates to clause 8(2).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 8(2) refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"legitimacy, legitimation, illegitimacy, parentage or non-parentage."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0015">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
Those actions involve the legal status of individuals. If, for example, one were trying to prove the father of an illegitimate child in the sheriff courts, one would raise an action of affiliation and aliment. The solicitor states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If therefore clause 8(2) is a reference to such actions then I would also refer you to clause 1(2) of the Bill which deals with corroboration by false denial. In such affiliation and aliment cases as you would expect there are generally only two parties that is the Pursuer and Defender and if the Defender is denying that sexual intercourse took place then it is going to be somewhat difficult in the absence of acceptance of DNA Coding or Blood Tests to prove the paternity. The existing rule of corroboration by false denial was in my view quite a useful evidential rule. The reason for that was that if the Defender denied a material fact and that denial could be shown to be false then that false denial is at the moment corroboration of the Pursuer's evidence and is what is known as corroboration by contradiction or corroboration by false denial."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am loth to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I bet that the hon. Gentleman is loth to do so. It would be wrong to say who that local solicitor is, but I am surprised that he bemoans the demise of that doctrine, which was frowned on in 1934 and has not been used recently. Its demise would hardly be a blow, even for the actions contemplated in clause 8.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The legal profession has its differences. However, the solicitor in question went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The difficulty for myself as a Legal Practitioner involved in such matters would be that if I have to fall back on Clause 8 which appears to take these family relationships out of the general relaxation of evidence then the Pursuer in an affiliation and aliment action is in fact—from an evidential point of view—worse off than before."</p></blockquote>
That is the crux of the matter. Can the Minister tell me why the pursuer in such cases would not be disadvantaged by the changes? Would a pursuer in an affiliation and aliment action be worse off under the changes in terms of the ability to present evidence? Would that be an improvement? This may be an argument among the professionals, but I should like to hear his view on the point raised by one of my local solicitors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) hit the nail on the head when he said that what is required is to establish truth, and the interests of justice which lie at the root of the Bill. Like him, I welcome my hon. Friend the Member for Bosworth (Mr. Tredinnick) to the Committee. I take a pragmatic approach on the 1968 debate relating to Lord Wylie. What counts is the evidence in the intervening period of 20 years, and the Scottish Law Commission report, which has been rightly praised by the hon. Members for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Darling) and for Garscadden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The speech of the hon. Member for Paisley, South (Mr. Buchan) came across strongly and clearly on Second Reading. He quoted the case—there are obviously many that can be quoted—of:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A man who was removing the scaffolding from a ship in the shipyard was found dead, with the scaffolding broken. There was no corroboration of the incident. I fought as hard as I could and went to various lawyers and various places, but I could not win the case because it required corroboration so that everyone knew what had happened."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
He went on to cite another case, and came out strongly in favour of the Bill, saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is with great pleasure, as well as the rustle of dead leaves, that I welcome the Bill."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 16 May 1988; Vol. 133, c. 757–8.]</p></blockquote>
The hon. Gentleman was right. There are many cases where the interests of justice are denied by too many technical requirements. The Bill is a modest step towards ensuring that justice is more readily obtained by more people. It has been generally welcomed. I acknowledge the part that Lord Morton played in another place, and the amendments that the Lord Advocate accepted from that source.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In answer to the point made by the hon. Member for Garscadden about the 	<i>Scottish Law Times</i> not being in the House of Commons Library, I must say that while I do not have ministerial responsibility for that matter, as a Scottish Member of Parliament I have previously made representations for the new digest on Scottish law to be taken by the Library, and I understand that it is now being taken. As individuals we are entitled to take up such points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central, spoke about delays and inconvenience, which we shall debate more fully on new clause 1 on legal aid. Recently we put up the limits for legal aid, and extensive consultations have been taking place with the Law Society of Scotland and the Scottish Legal Aid Board. We hope to come forward with new regulations in approximately two or three weeks' time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Garscadden mentioned Lord Wylie in 1968. That was one man's view. The Bill is based on the considered views of the Scottish Law Commission, and should be seen in that light.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Legal aid is obviously of great concern to hon. Members. On Second Reading, I mentioned a letter of 12 February from the Law Society of Scotland. It is in the Library, but I can circulate copies to the Committee. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Committee asked me to thank you for explaining the position and to let you know that as far as the Committee was concerned the matter would not be taken any further."</p></blockquote>
I understand that it raised a number of points and, of course, legal aid is numbered among them. We have consulted with the Scottish Legal Aid Board, and we hope to come forward with the necessary regulations soon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the subject of costs, the hon. Member for Garscadden asked me about delays and inconvenience in relation to paragraph 2.9. In a sense, he answered his own question. The relaxation in the Bill will contribute in some way to minimising the costs and delays in courts, and the Lord Advocate has responsibility for civil court procedures and considers whether they can be improved to make them more efficient and less costly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of probabalis causa was raised by the hon. Members for Edinburgh, Central and for Garscadden. Probabalis causa would still be a relevant factor in assessing legal aid applications and, as I said on Second Reading, I do not believe that the Bill would lead to a flood of weak claims. We are simply trying to remove the technical barriers referred to in paragraph 2.9.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister make his position clear? When this Bill has been enacted, I assume that it will be sufficient for recognition to be submitted from a would-be pursuer stating the facts as he sees them, corroboration no

longer being necessary. I should be very worried if the Scottish Legal Aid Board were to insist on anything more than that—in other words, to ask for more than the court might ask for.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall discuss that more thoroughly under new clause 1, which is specifically about legal aid. I accept the hon. Gentleman's argument that it is necessary to minimise delays as far as possible, and I recognise his anxiety about the interests of justice. However, he was wrong in one respect. The Scottish Legal Aid Board is independent. When the original legislation went through the House, there were specific representations to the effect that it should be independent, and that is why it has that status.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will pursue his point in detail under new clause 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members have raised the question of criminal cases and whether there was any risk of corroboration being extended. We have noted the strength of representations on that made on Second Reading and in Committee. As I stated previously, the Scottish Law Commission is undertaking an entirely separate consideration of criminal evidence. That will be dealt with on its own merits, and I should not like to speculate now on its ultimate recommendations. However, it is fair to say that corroboration is regarded as a cornerstone of the law of criminal evidence—which is what hon. Members have been saying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise that the Scottish Law Commission is examining criminal evidence, but the Government are independent of the Scottish Law Commission and we are entitled to know their view. The Government might change their view later if there were persuasive arguments from the Scottish Law Commission. We are seeking a statement from the Government that they regard corroboration as a cornerstone and will stand by that. Governments are entitled to have views and I invite the Minister to give the Government's current view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said very clearly that we regard corroboration in criminal cases as a cornerstone of criminal law and criminal evidence. Obviously, we shall want to consider whatever evidence the Scottish Law Commission puts forward, together with representations here, in due course. I have been given no hint of what recommendations it will make, but I imagine that they will be well thought out, like its other representations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Darling) asked whether the Bill would provide an easy path. It seeks to remove technical barriers, but will not necessarily solve all the problems inherent in bringing a case to a conclusion. The hon. Gentleman should accept that no-fault liability is outside the scope of the Bill. Whether that is a good way forward needs consideration and I shall draw his remarks to the attention of the Lord Advocate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Usually, before any fundamental change in the law, a thorough study of the evidence is made by the Scottish Law Commission. The hon. Gentleman referred to asbestos cases and the difficulty of proving the facts 30 years later. I shall certainly mention that to the Lord Advocate. The Bill's relaxations would apply to tribunals
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
and arbitrations except where specific provision is made as to evidence. I refer the hon. Gentleman to clause 9. A tribunal could retain rules providing for corroboration. That is a matter for those who lay down and establish those rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh) raised the question of corroboration by false denial. Page 8 of the Scottish Law Commission report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The majority of those who commented on Memorandum No. 46 were against retention of the doctrine of corroboration by false denial … if our proposal to abolish the legal requirement of corroboration generally in civil cases is accepted, the need for the doctrine will disappear."</p></blockquote>
I noted what the hon. Gentleman said, but the weight of the representation in favour of abolition is strong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This clause represents a major step in achieving the Bill's objective of ensuring that justice is not denied to parties by the operation of technical rules of evidence. It implements the first main recommendation of the Scottish Law Commission—that is, to abolish the requirement for corroboration in civil proceedings. If the clause is enacted, a party can pursue or defend a claim simply, and I use the word advisedly, by allowing the court to consider whatever evidence is available. No longer will he be bound to fail, or even not get as far as a court hearing, because he could not surmount the barrier of corroboration—which, in some cases, may relate to technical matters rather than to the substance of the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, I do not believe that parties will seize upon the opportunities presented by the clause to bring cases that would cause judges, well used to the current requirements, to throw up their hands in horror. It is an important facet of the clause—and, indeed, the Bill as a whole—that it does not affect in any way the court's need to be satisfied by the evidence before it can find a fact to be proved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister mentioned false denial and dismissed my point because the majority view in the commission's report was against. However, if he reads on, page 8 of the report also states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"though the number of cases in which the doctrine has been relied on may suggest that without it a pursuer with an honest claim in an affiliation case might have had great difficulty in otherwise securing justice."</p></blockquote>
Will a pursuer in an affiliation and aliment case be worse off under this change in terms of ability to present evidence? That was raised by my local solicitor. Will a person be worse off after these changes because this doctrine will have gone?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman refers to an aliment case. For affiliation cases, evidence was given that in certain cases these changes might have an adverse effect. The weight of the representations was strongly against it on the ground that it was a doubtful and unsatisfactory doctrine. For example, a lady may have had a number of relationships and then makes an allegation that one of them is responsible for her child. Obviously, if one person has made inconsistent statements that are used against him, that is not necessarily proof that he is the father of the child.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause deals with corroboration in any civil proceedings. That expression is defined in clause 9, and no doubt hon. Members will wish to examine that in detail later. Essentially, the clause applies to any civil proceedings before the ordinary courts or before tribunals, inquiries and arbitrations. These latter proceedings,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0017">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
however, do not include instances where specific provision has been made as to what rules of evidence will apply. That could be done, for example, by way of specific tribunal rules or by the agreement of parties in a non-statutory arbitration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As was mentioned earlier, the clause removes the rule in affiliation actions that corroboration can be achieved by false denial. It is highly unlikely that this evidential rule will be mourned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will not have escaped the notice of hon. Members that this entire clause takes up only six lines in the Bill. In those few lines, however, the Bill achieves a major reform of our law of evidence. It is not a case of the baby being thrown out with the bathwater. Corroboration will continue to play an important role in the deciding of cases. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central is quite right to believe that courts will rely on the best evidence available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that parties will continue to try to lead as much relevant evidence as is possible. However, this clause will take us away from the position where, as a matter of law, a party should always be denied success if he or she is unable to provide corroboration on every point necessary for the establishment of the case. In the past, that has been dealt with by the courts adopting in certain cases what might best be described as a flexible attitude to the requirement for corroboration. The legislature has also played its part by abolishing the requirement, but in a piecemeal fashion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause seeks to apply the abolition of the requirement for corroboration to all civil proceedings. It will be of great value in allowing cases to come to court that were otherwise bound to fail. I do not think that that will add to the burden of the courts as, on balance, those cases that come to court should be capable of being dealt with more speedily as parties will not feel compelled to lead corroborative evidence on each and every aspect. The clause will remove technical barriers while leaving cornerstones of the law of evidence intact. The clause is an important step forward and I commend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I enjoyed the Minister's peroration; it was well prepared. I was a little surprised that he should dismiss the comments of Lord Wylie as being just one man's view. He was, after all, the official Conservative Front Bench spokesman at the time. He fortunately was not a judge, so I cannot accuse the Minister of murmuring a judge, but he was murmuring a potential judge. I should love to be able to refer to the Minister's comments as just one man's view, but I have to live with the fact that the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth) is one man and a man with very odd views, but as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, he speaks for the Government and there is a certain, sinister significance in what he says. However, I am a little surprised at the way an official Conservative spokesman is shrugged off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was delighted to hear the Minister wrestling with probabilis causa. It was interesting to hear his pronunciation. I understand that there is a great argument about that between the ancient universities of Oxford and Cambridge. If I remember rightly, the hon. Gentleman went to Oxford where he had a distinguished boxing
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
career. I went to neither place so I do not know which camp I am in, but perhaps I should not follow that line of thought too far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was not entirely satisfied by some of the Minister's remarks. He said very fairly that we would pursue the legal aid point at greater length later on new clause 1. I shall leave it until then, except to give him advance notice that I hope he will deal with the matter in a rather more satisfactory manner. On 16 May he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We had a debate on a statutory instrument in Committee and further improvements are being prepared."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 16 May 1988; Vol. 133, c. 767–768.]</p></blockquote>
If further improvements are being prepared, it would not be unreasonable to expect the Minister to give us some idea of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If improvements were being prepared on 16 May, they must have been decided on in principle. It is now considerably later than 16 May—we are well into June. I expect the Minister to say a few words about the improvements. I do not expect him to read us the statutory instrument, but to tell us about the improvements and how they will deal with the vexed questions that worry petitioners and litigants. It is only solicitors who have vested interests in the operation of the Scottish legal aid board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A further statutory instrument will be introduced and it will be thoroughly debated in due course."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 16 May 1988; Vol. 133, c. 768.]</p></blockquote>
No doubt the statutory instrument will be thoroughly debated in due course, but the problem is that statutory instruments are debated thoroughly for only one and a half hours and cannot be amended. It is particularly important that we have the opportunity to influence the Minister's thoughts before that. It is too late once the statutory instrument is before the House. Therefore it is important that the Minister takes the opportunity provided by new clause 1 to make the Government's stance clear. We could usefully and constructively make our comments at a stage when they can perhaps influence thinking, before the statutory instrument is engraved in tablets of stone and laid before the House. I live in eternal optimism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister commented on tribunals. The main debate will occur on clause 9, so this is merely a foretaste. It may be useful if the Minister gives us an explanation. As I understand it—and I hope that I am right—unless special arrangements are made by the parties, tribunals held in Scotland will automatically adopt the laws on corroboration and hearsay set out in the Bill. I trust that I have that in reasonable order in my mind. It will be worth exploring that further on clause 9, and the Minister should be aware of that intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) referred to tribunals dealing with important matters affecting the everyday life of applicants for benefit. Many tribunals work on a United Kingdom basis. I am not clear whether there are different rules of evidence for a Department of Health and Social Security tribunal in England and in Scotland. It is inconceivable that special arrangements will be made. Let us suppose that Mr. X from the Drumchapel housing scheme is having a barney about his income support and goes to tribunal. It is unlikely that he will telephone the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0018">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
Department of Health and Social Security office and say, "By the way, I want to make a special bargain about the rules of evidence in my case. Perhaps we can agree that the Civil Evidence (Scotland) Bill will not apply and that we shall put something else in its place." Presumably, in almost all cases, the rules of evidence that apply will reflect the legislation that we are considering, and in particular the clause, which abolishes the need for corroboration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall reach the matter of hearsay on the next clause. I understand that there may be considerable differences between the evidence laws of England and of Scotland. Indeed, the English solution to the hearsay problem—if I remember rightly—is included in part I of the Civil Evidence Act 1968, and was specifically rejected by the Scottish Law Commission as a way forward for law reform north of the border. Will tribunals adopt the Scots laws of evidence automatically? That would leave different laws of evidence north and south of the border. I am confused as I have never had any such tribunal work, but no doubt the Minister will be able to clear up that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister dealt with the issues of delay, muddle and expense, which are sadly sometimes the mark of the legal process. I drew his attention to the Lord Chancellor's review, but I did not commend its suggestions even though some are interesting. He said that the Scottish Law Commission was considering criminal evidence, which is outwith the Bill. Perhaps the Minister will say whether there is currently a similar inquiry into civil procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said briefly that in both the Court of Session and the sheriff court there are massive opportunities for simplification of the very complicated processes. In adjusting pleadings, we are attempting sometimes to dance cumbrously on the head of a pin. It adds enormously to the length and cost of litigation. The Bill attempts to strike at that expense, so can the Minister say whether talks are already in progress? Is the Law Commission or his Department currently involved in such a valuable exercise? I understand informally that it would be supported by the legal profession and its representatives. If that process is not already under way, the Minister should consider it as soon as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for south Angus—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is Angus, East.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, south Angus has been partly translated into Angus, East. It is very confusing, but we know whom we are talking about. We are not talking about the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker), for which we are grateful. I appreciate that there is an important distinction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh) is again displaying the appetite that he has honourably displayed in many other political arenas. He represented a minority position when he put forward his argument about corroboration by false denial. I should have thought that there was no case for its retention, although I am doubtful about trying to construct as an academic exercise circumstances in which such a matter would be decided on credibility. There will always be circumstances—social, access, actions of the parties and so on—which will help the court to decide between a male protesting his innocence and a lady protesting his involvement. It is unlikely that anyone will ever say "Surrounding circumstances cannot help, but I believe A and not B," or "B and not A."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Central said that corroboration by false denial has in effect fallen into desuetude. We are attempting nothing more than a small tidying-up operation in removing it from the statute book. I recognise that the hon. Member for Angus, East is quite properly reflecting a constituency point that has been put to him by a man with expertise. I do not believe that it is a valid point, but that does not deny his right to suggest it or his initiative in drawing it to the Minister's attention. The balance of the argument is against him, but I do not believe—although I may be wrong—that he intended to divide the Committee on the basis of the letter that he shared with us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not entirely clear about the Minister's position. We pressed him hard about corroboration in relation to criminal evidence and he showed a tendency to take refuge in masonic parallels. I mean masonic in terms not of the organisation, but of the art of the mason. We heard much about cornerstones, which may have been keystones or something similar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the Scottish Law Commission is a useful and valuable organisation. I think that the post of chairman is currently vacant, as Lord Maxwell has retired, or is about to retire. Can the Minister help me on that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister cannot help.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister can clear up whether Lord Maxwell is still in office, or has bowed out after a distinguished career, and if so, whether a successor has been appointed. As we are dealing with criminal evidence, it would be interesting to know who is in charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Law Commission has a valuable role to play, but its words are not sacrosanct. We shall shortly discuss clause 2, where the Government have scrapped the Law Commission's important recommendations about safeguards on hearsay evidence. It is right that the Government should have that discretion; I do not suggest that they should simply wait for recommendations from the Law Commission and then put them on the statute book. Ministers are allowed to exercise independent judgment, and I mean that as a hint.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman will press the Government for something more reassuring than talk of cornerstones. We have seen from the Government's horrendous policies on major aspects of Scottish life that they tend to tear down keystones and cornerstones and destroy the fabric of Scotland's national institutions. We hope for a more substantial response than talk of cornerstones. Given the Government's record, I tremble for the future of the Scottish legal system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have much sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's remarks. I should not want to cast the Minister as Samson Agonistes pulling down the temple around him. But he should go further. I was ragging him that he should not just tell the Committee that the matter is being considered by the Law Commission, but inform us of the Government's view. That was a fair point to put to him, but a cornerstone appeared too readily again. If he is in a position to do so—I hope he is—he should say that the Government have no intention of removing corroboration for criminal evidence and regard it as non-negotiable as a general principle, even though there may be a case for minor changes in the criminal evidence system. I was disappointed by the Minister's approach,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0019">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
particularly as he tends to take a vigorous oratorical line on such matters. I hoped that we would have a more satisfactory reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We still have some probing to do—the matter may come up again on clause 2. In the Second Reading debate, the Minister said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Corroboration as a safeguard will remain and it is for the courts to reply on the best evidence."</p></blockquote>
I am unsure whether the best evidence rule is what the law of evidence says is the best evidence and not necessarily the best evidence itself. That comes up in the Law Commission's report and is a good debating point, which we may be able to discuss later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Corroboration remains a safeguard because any conscientious solicitor wants to buttress the client's case by ensuring that he does not risk just the credibility test on the client, if corroboration exists. Knowing some clients, that may be risky. If corroboration exists, it will presumably need to be read. But it is not right to say simplistically that corroboration as a safeguard will remain. The whole point of the Bill is that corroboration will not remain as a necessity. If it exists, it will be used as court tactics and to represent fully the client's case. But as a safeguard, it applies. The Minister is a little disingenuous when he talks in those terms. He said on Second Reading:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We want to ensure that in all cases the best evidence available is brought forward. In most cases, corroboration will be relied on so that the courts have the best evidence. So far as possible, the courts will seek to call the witnesses who have made statements."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 16 May 1988; Vol. 133, c. 768, 770.]</p></blockquote>
Again, many arguments are begged as to what amounts to best evidence and the rules of the court. We shall deal with those in an amendment to clause 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister represents the Bill—rather ambitiously—as being of great value. At the same time, he hurries to say that all the corroboration safeguards will remain, and that it makes no difference. The truth is somewhere in between, but I suspect that the changes will be comparatively modest. After all, the big breakthrough was section 9 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1968. The arguments that my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, South (Mr. Buchan) fairly deployed on Second Reading were all examples of why section 9 should be on the statute book, and did not go beyond that. Indeed, the average member of the public thinks of civil actions as divorce cases or personal damages actions, such as the bus that jilted, the pavement that was cracked, the rivet that fell off the scaffolding, or the fingers that were caught in the machine. Most of the obvious situations that arise have already been covered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the provision is a modest advance, it is nevertheless an advance and that is why we are anxious to support it—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Pardon?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only other aspect of clause 1 that we have not discussed is consistorial actions, for which the Law Commission suggests that a distinction could be made.
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
However, the right slot for such a subject is clause 8. I mention the matter simply because I do not want the Committee to think that we have forgotten it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must apologise to my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) for the incident on his left. I realise that incidents take place to his left occasionally, but am sure that he would never critisise me on such grounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also genuinely grateful for the free legal advice, not only from the Minister but from my hon. Friends the Members for Garscadden and for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh) who, although not a qualified lawyer, represents the interests of the Solicitor-General, who is one of his constituents. I am a simple layman, as will soon become evident. I cannot even contribute to the debate about the pronunciation of "causa", as I got only as far as a failed A-level in Latin, followed by several editions of the Tradentine Mass.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall dwell briefly on the argument about tribunals, which is relevant to a significant number of our constituents. Civil proceedings in their more rarefied form are probably of interest to a minority. I recently discovered to my cost that, if one wants to bring an action for defamation in Scotland, one can run up against a defence of uncorroborated hearsay evidence. My hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden looks alarmed, but a certain daily newspaper, or what purports to be a newspaper—	<i>The Sun</i>—stated as fact that I had carried out a criminal assault on no less a person than the Secretary of State for Scotland on the Floor of the House of Commons. It said that I had been reprimanded by Mr. Speaker—quite rightly, I suppose—for having done so. I sought legal advice about that, thinking that the report had to be defamation by any standards. I was advised—at some expense—that the newspaper could put up a successful defence against any action by saying that it was quoting uncorroborated hearsay evidence from another hon. Member. However, that is not important. What is more important is the question of tribunals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am speaking under parliamentary protection and therefore feel emboldened to repeat a wounding libel. I understood that what was particularly damaging to my hon. Friend's reputation was the suggestion that he was on the Left wing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I was not seeking legal advice on that. I was more concerned at the suggestions that not only had I assaulted the Secretary of State for Scotland, but, that I had failed to do so with sufficient effectiveness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me deal now with the worrying question of tribunals. As the clause covers civil proceedings inasmuch as that term can be taken to include tribunals, it is potentially relevant to many cases involving a large number of citizens of Scotland who may be claiming social security or unemployment benefit. We have all come across classic cases in our constituencies where it is alleged by someone that an unemployment benefit claimant or income support claimant is in fact working, or has another income, while claiming such benefits. Such cases are taken to tribunals, proofs must be made and then the tribunal reaches a conclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Bill, I understand that it will be possible for an official of the Department of Health and Social Security to attend such a tribunal and lead as hearsay,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0020">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
uncorroborated evidence that Mr. X from Haddington was working in a tattie field in Dunbar on such and such a day when he was claiming unemployment benefit or income support. It might be perfectly straightforward for Mr. X to demonstrate that he was not in a tattie field in Dunbar at the time, but at Musselburgh races. He might easily be able to provide any number of witnesses to say that he was at the races. If he does not take the precaution of bringing along people to provide such evidence however, the tribunal could, on the uncorroborated evidence of a DHSS official, find that Mr. X is not eligible to carry on claiming his benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From what the Minister has said this morning, I take it that in those circumstances where the case led by the DHSS is not accurate, he would advise people always to ensure—if evidence is available—that they bring witnesses to the tribunal to disprove the allegations of the DHSS. I imagine that, in the future, it will be far too easy for the DHSS successfully to challenge claims in such cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about people who would not normally seek legal advice and who might not be well versed in the terms of the law. They may find it surprising that an official can lead evidence which everyone—apart from the official, presumably—knows is not true and which results in them being deprived of their meagre income. That is perhaps the most worrying aspect of the Government's proposals: it could affect a great many people in Scotland. I recognise the much more complicated aspects of the legislation to which my hon. Friends have already referred, but I should be grateful if the Minister would say more about tribunals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One or two points arising from the Minister's response are less than satisfactory, but before commenting on them I want to add to what my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) said about corroboration by false denial. There is no need to mourn its passing. It is used only by tabloid newspapers, which employ it to substantiate something that otherwise would not stand up in journalistic terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am far from satisfied and rather worried about the Minister's remarks on criminal proceedings. He gave a less than forthright assurance that corroboration would not be abandoned in criminal proceedings. He referred to the Scottish Law Commission as if it were an esoteric body that might, or might not, have proposals to make. He said that it would report in due course and that the Government would probably take its recommendations on board, but that they might not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the current climate where utterances are made daily by senior members of the Government, we have every right to be worried that the Government may, for reasons of political expediency, adopt a limitation of the law of corroboration. I refer again to the unfortunate events of the past few days. It could be a knee-jerk reaction—by calling for blood and baying for revenge—and the Government might be minded to abandon corroboration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be a sad day if that happened. I ask the Minister for a complete and categorical assurance that there is no question of abandoning corroboration from criminal cases. If that is not forthcoming, we shall be entitled to alert people in Scotland to the fact that the Government might consider that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the Minister for his tepid welcome to my asbestos, no-fault liability limitations. If he refers the
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
matter to the Lord Advocate, I hope that he will suggest, in the nicest possible way and with the greatest respect, that the Lord Advocate give it serious consideration in the near future rather than leave it in the pending tray with other representations. However, I am grateful for the fact that the Minister did not say that he would not consider it. I hope that he will take it from me that there is a growing campaign and a belief that the matter now deserves urgent attention rather than attention on the never-never.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1 encapsulates the spirit of the Bill. I said that we welcomed it, and we still do, but the Minister has sounded two alarm bells. The first is that although we are abolishing corroboration, the law may not change much. That reminds me of what happened with the section 9 provision in the 1968 Act: within three or four years there was judicial expression to the effect that Parliament might have changed the law but had not changed it that much. It took a further case to clarify the position on Scottish case law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the courts get a clear message that it is Parliament's intention that corroboration is to be abolished. That should not lead people to believe that where there is evidence to the contrary or evidence that does not entirely support the proposition advanced, it should not be led or considered. However, I hope that no one will think that an uncorroborated statement cannot be accepted simply because there might be a different story. The Minister should make it clear that it is Parliament's intention to abolish the rule requiring corroboration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second alarm bell concerns tribunals. We shall discuss that matter at greater length when we reach clause 8, but there is no point in saying in one breath that we are abolishing corroboration and with the next that tribunal may have rules that will undermine that. That would drive a coach and horses through the Bill's intention. It would be intolerable if the law were different for tribunals—it must be the same, as is intended, no matter the forum. Moreover, English law should not be allowed to taint procedure in Scottish tribunals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I argue that point strongly because many cases now come before tribunals and have serious repercussions for those who go before them. The Government bend over backwards to make sure that it is difficult for a claimant to succeed in a DHSS tribunal—such is the vendetta that they pursue towards those driven to resort to them A claimant should not be told that although corroboration is not required in civil actions in Scotland, it is required in social security tribunals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can foresee that happening because the Government are not above twisting the rules to ensure that it is difficult for people to claim their rights. In fact, in many parts of the Conservative party that is considered a virtue. Can the Minister assure us that that will not happen? It would be iniquitous to say that one person pursuing a claim in the Court of Session does not have to worry about corroboration while another, who is toiling in a tribunal, does. We shall want to explore that at greater length when we reach clause 8.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite the terms of the Minister's peroration, which was clearly prepared in advance of today's proceedings and possibly in the hope that no one would say much, his remarks—rightly and understandably made in reply to points raised by Opposition Members—sounded alarm
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0021">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
bells. Unless the Minister gives us an assurance, he cannot assume that we shall let the Bill go through with only a few remarks from us on each clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be wrong for the Minister to herald this as a great advance for the public and then leave the door open for twisting and turning and evading the intention. I appreciate that the Minister is at a disadvantage in that he may not be entirely master in his own house: those sitting next to him with direct lines to the Almighty may decide matters differently. If we do not get an assurance, we may not go along with his remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lord Morton of Shuna did an excellent job in revising the Bill in the more tranquil surroundings of the other place. As a result of our efforts this morning we have flushed out the Minister's thoughts and he has made one or two unfortunate remarks and may tarnish what is otherwise a good provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to respond to the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Darling) and deal with the question of tribunals, which the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) also raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unless contrary provision is made, the provisions in the Bill will apply to tribunals. Tribunals can require a particular type of evidential regime in certain circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I presume that in a national system of tribunals, such as the DHSS, the rules of evidence that apply will be those of that part of the country in which the tribunals sits. That means that if the tribunal sits in Scotland, the Scottish rules of evidence will apply, and in England, the English rules of evidence will apply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall have to check because I cannot speak for what happens in England, but I assume that there will be some consistency throughout the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be open to parties—for example, to arbitrations—to agree which rules should apply. That is a different case, but generally the rules relating to civil cases apply also to tribunals, unless exceptions have been laid down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must press the Minister. The point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Central is important. If a different approach is adopted by a DHSS tribunal, depending on whether it is north or south of the border, a case may succeed in Scotland which would fail in England, and vice versa. Alternatively, a civil action based upon similar grounds might succeed in the civil courts, but fail in the tribunal. That is unsatisfactory and needs to be cleared up. Perhaps it is my fault. I had never thought about this matter before—presumably the differences in the rules of evidence presently arise in tribunals organised by a Ministry. Clearly there is no question of the individual negotiating his terms; he must take what the rules say. I should like the Minister to explain how that works.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is putting forward a hypothesis in the absence of evidence. Domestic rules will apply unless there is specific provision for evidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the circumstances suggested by the hon. Member for East Lothian it would be prudent to bring along all the
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
witnesses to the tribunal and inquiry. At present, tribunals normally have more relaxed evidential rules. I do not know of many problem cases in Scotland, and I think that the measure will be welcomed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned corroboration as a safeguard. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central made a plea for the best evidence, with which I agree. I have said that the court will require to be satisfied by the evidence. As the hon. Gentleman said, the courts and their legal representatives will continue to need as much evidence as possible, including corroboration if that is available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this debate hon. Members seem to feel most strongly about criminal cases. The Government have no intention of considering the removal of corroboration in criminal cases. We have not brought forward such proposals so it follows that we find the present arrangements satisfactory. In due course we shall have to consider carefully the report of the Scottish Law Commission when it studies the matter. It is undertaking a separate consideration of criminal evidence, and I would not wish to speculate on its ultimate recommendations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already dealt with that in relation to paragraph 2:9 of the report.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Minister misunderstood me. I drew attention to the fact that the English, under Lord Mackay of Clashfern, are busy looking at the whole question of court procedures and the way in which civil litigation is ordered and processed. I think that almost every lawyer to whom I have spoken accepts that there are enormous possibilities for reform and I want to know whether they are in hand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The review to which the hon. Gentleman refers is the Lord Chancellor's review. It relates to England and Wales, and we are not a party to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So what?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The procedures in Scotland are not identical to those in England. Many Scottish Law Commission inquiries and reports have been drawn up separately and they are being considered as speedily as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On affiliation cases, the constituents of the hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh) would not be worse off. They would be disadvantaged only if corroboration was still required. We seek to remove the need for corroboration so parties will not be worse off by seeking to establish their case. His constituent who is a lawyer will be able to bring forward whatever evidence he wishes in any cases involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the detailed points of legal aid regulations, we are consulting and will come forward with regulations. The hon. Member for Garscadden wanted specific points. They were announced in December and if he does not have a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0022">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
copy I should be happy to show him one if he remains behind at the end of the sitting. If necessary, I shall make it available to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central referred to the alleged poor performance of the Scottish Legal Aid Board. I accept that the new body had difficulties at the outset, but the regulations will soon be available to improve the arrangements. The board is amending its procedures and will be subject to an efficiency review soon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Legal Aid Board inherited a major task in not only taking over existing arrangements, but introducing an entirely new system for summary criminal legal aid. We expect the improvement soon for the reasons that I gave earlier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister should, out of decency, clarify that remark. Whatever the drawbacks and difficulties of the Law Society of Scotland, it should not be suggested that the Scottish Legal Aid Board took over a ramshackle regime. For all its faults and the criticisms that can be levelled at it and its administration, the scheme worked and that has not happened since the Scottish Legal Aid Board took it over.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is exaggerating. There is room for improvement, without question, and we shall come forward with the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should clarify a point that I made to the hon. Member for Garscadden about a review of civil procedure when he called for similar action in Scotland. The Lord Advocate is considering the whole range of civil procedure, that being his ministerial responsibility. The Bill is specifically the Lord Advocate's Bill because evidence definitely comes within his specific responsibilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. That was a much more helpful reply. He said that the Lord Advocate is considering civil procedure. I recognise that the Minister is not the Lord Advocate, but will he say a word or two more about that? Is it a specific inquiry? Is there a remit and a timescale? Or is the Minister merely suggesting that the Lord Advocate keeps a friendly and informed eye on those matters as part of his running responsibilities? That is an important distinction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any Minister with responsibility ought to be interested, but if a Minister is undertaking a specific inquiry and considering reform, that is a more positive and hopeful proposition. The distinction should be made and spelt out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot go further on that point at this stage, but if the hon. Gentleman presses me on it later in the Committee, I shall be glad to respond.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
lengthy debate on these clauses. However, I am a little curious. As so often happens, I am perhaps trying to have my cake and eat it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 2 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In any civil proceedings—
	<br><blockquote><p>(a) evidence shall not be excluded solely on the ground that it is hearsay".</p></blockquote></p></blockquote>
What is the significance of the word "solely"? Presumably evidence can be excluded on all sorts of grounds, such as that it is irrelevant or incompetent. The word "solely" implies that although it cannot be excluded simply on the ground that it is hearsay, it could be excluded at least partially on that ground—hearsay plus something else. I am not clear on the reasons for that. I am applying the old-fashioned art, which has almost fallen into disuse, of trying to parse a sentence and understand it; I am not trying to make a complicated legal point. To a layman, the provision that
	<br><blockquote><p>"evidence shall not be excluded solely on the ground that it is hearsay"</p></blockquote>
carries the obvious implication that it may at least be struck out partially because it is hearsay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not believe that that was the case, and I wonder whether the Minister will explain. I understood that hearsay evidence would be treated like any other form of evidence. Of course, it might fail all sorts of other tests, just as direct or best evidence might fail in terms of the rules of evidence. The word "solely" implies that the evidence could be struck at, partly because it is hearsay, partly because of something else. That is a little difficult to understand in the context of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hasten to say that I recognise that the word appears in the drafting of the Scottish Law Commission. Most members of the Committee will be aware that in appendix A to report No. 100, there is a draft of a Bill. If the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"excluded solely on the ground that it is hearsay"</p></blockquote>
have found favour with the Scottish Law Commission and with the Scottish Office draftsmen, it would be a brave man who would raise any query. I thought that it was worth asking the Minister to say something about that but he will have to wait a minute, because there is another amendment in this group and it would be courteous and helpful to the Committee if we dealt also with amendment No. 3.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is where, as I rather disingenuously said, I am trying to have my cake and eat it. I refer to clause 2(1)(c) because it does not appear in the draft Bill, as the advisers to the Minister will remember. I have great faith in the Minister's advisers' having reasons for doing things. I do not always agree with the reasons, and it is entirely proper that we should on occasion make our disagreement known, but I usually accept that they have reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under clause 2(1) in the draft Bill, there is a paragraph (a), which I have quoted, and a paragraph (b), which corresponds with clause 2(1)(b) in the Bill under consideration. However, clause 2(1)(c) in the Bill—
	<br><blockquote><p>"the court, or as the case may be the jury, if satisfied that any fact has been established by evidence in those proceedings, shall be entitled to find that fact proved by the evidence notwithstanding that the evidence is hearsay"—</p></blockquote>
does not appear in the draft Bill. Presumably, that is because those people in the Scottish Law Commission who drafted it were satisfied that the point was fairly made by clause 2(1)(b) which, to avoid doubt, I shall repeat. It states:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0023">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"a statement made by a person otherwise than in the course of the proof shall be admissible as evidence of any matter contained in the statement of which direct oral evidence by that person would be admissible".</p></blockquote>
If there is in statute a statement that something is admissible as evidence, the court may rely upon it in any findings of fact that it makes. It would be rather odd if that were not the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I am not clear why clause 2(1)(c) is in the Bill. The Minister may tell me that it is there for the avoidance of doubt, to stop people raising idiot questions and to make the position doubly safe. He is not only locking, but barring the door in terms of public comprehension of what is included in the Bill. I thought that I should table the amendment and invite the Minister, in his usual courteous—I was going to say lucid, but I shall stick to courteous—fashion, to explain the exact significance of the two minor points that I have raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My first instinct was to accept the hon. Gentleman's amendment, but unfortunately I cannot do so. I shall explain why.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman may believe that the word "solely" is not strictly necessary, but if that word were omitted as he suggests, the paragraph might then mean that hearsay evidence could not be excluded even if there were other grounds for exclusion such as relevancy or competency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In particular cases the evidence may be such that it might be excluded regardless of the fact that it is hearsay. Evidence in breach of confidence or professional privilege or evidence that is incompetent—where proof only by writ or oath is competent—might be excluded on such grounds. The drafting of the provision to include the term "solely" makes it clear that evidence may continue to be excluded on grounds such as those to which reference has been made, notwithstanding that if it were susceptible to be excluded only on the basis that it was hearsay, it could not be excluded. To leave out the word "solely" could make the provision ambiguous so there is some merit in retaining the present drafting. It makes it clear that although an item of evidence cannot be excluded because of hearsay, it can be excluded on other grounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's other amendment seeks to remove the provision of clause 2(1)(c), which, as he said, did not appear in the Scottish Law Commission's draft Bill. As I said on Second Reading, an important element of the Bill's treatment of both uncorroborated and hearsay evidence is the specific statement—as the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Darling) has said—that a court must still be satisfied with the evidence before it is entitled to find a fact proved by that evidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that in the cases of corroboration and hearsay the Bill does not affect that requirement, which is an essential part of our rules of evidence. The statement contained in clauses 1 and 2 that such a requirement remains is an important sign to those dealing with the new rules. We have already approved the inclusion of such a statement in clause 1 and it would be anomalous to omit it from clause 2. For those reasons, I urge the hon. Gentleman not to press the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make a general point about paragraph (c). I am glad that the Minister said that the provisos that we discussed during the debate on the previous clause would be at the fore. I am worried that

crucial facts may be established on hearsay evidence, which is undesirable. We must examine how the workings of this clause pan out in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should not have thought that the court would rely on evidence that was not competent or admissible. We are worried about the word "solely", because we should not want a court or jury to say, "We cannot exclude evidence solely because it is hearsay, but we can find other reasons for excluding it." It depends upon the weight or emphasis attached to the word. I understand the Minister's argument, but it has happened in the past—or is suspected to have happened—that Parliament has made a new rule and others have sought to go behind or around it. That would also be undesirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no doubt that, before long, the provisions of this clause and others will be tested and judicial decisions made. We may have to reconsider the problems. We are however, entering new ground. The Scottish Law Commission said that fine distinctions would have to be made, but in the light of experience our fears may prove to be unjustified. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) was right to press his amendment and to force the Minister to explain what he meant. The tragedy is that at the end of the day, it does not matter what we say. What matters is the interpretation placed on the clause by the judiciary. I hope that the Minister will be prepared to come back if necessary to make amendments to the law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for saying that he was tempted by the first amendment. It shows that it was not a laughable point to make. It would be silly to press the amendments to a Division and it would be out of all proportion to their importance. I am however, getting slightly confused. Perhaps we are all tying ourselves in knots, but I do not understand the Minister's point about clause 2(1)(c). He seemed to argue that it was important to have safeguards to ensure that, although hearsay evidence is now admissible, it does not give anyone licence to act without best evidence, corroboration and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 2(1)(c) underlines the fact that hearsay evidence is admissible. Presumably it also encourages the thought that if one has a good piece of hearsay that will do. I do not suggest for a moment that any lawyer would fall into that trap, but I do not see that the addition of paragraph (c) buttresses the point. My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Darling) expressed doubts about the possibility of a case being decided on hearsay evidence alone. I understand his doubts, but however rare it might be in practice as good practice will mean that other evidence will be adduced if it is available, in extremis—if there is no other evidence—the Bill allows hearsay evidence to be treated as the vital corroboration, or as sufficient in itself if there is no corroboration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When my hon. Friend framed his amendments did he consider the possibility of placing an obligation on someone who would rely on hearsay evidence at least to give notice of that to his opponent? Perhaps a specific obligation ought to be enshrined in the Bill requiring people to lead the best evidence so that hearsay could not be relied upon where the maker of the statement was available, but never called.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an important point. That must have been a matter of major consideration for the Government

because they specifically rejected the recommendations of the Scottish Law Commission on that point. Amendment No. 4, which we shall debate next Tuesday, is a trigger for such debate—it is a halfway house. I am not trying to reinstate the rather clumsy machinery in the Scottish Law Commission's proposals and which the Government felt abolished the whole point of the reform in clause 2, but the amendment tries to build back in some form of safeguard. Our debate on that will be interesting and important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not intend to press amendment No. 3, that would be redundant. I have made my point. The position is made clear by clause 2(1)(b) that says that hearsay evidence is admissible. In common with the Scottish Law Commission I see no point in going further than that, but as the Minister might say, there is no harm in it, even though I cannot understand the arguments that he has advanced about buttressing the safeguards. I shall not press amendment No. 2 although I should like the Minister to say a word or two more about it. I am not very convinced by what he had to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Clause 2(1)(a) states:
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"evidence shall not be excluded solely on the grounds that it is hearsay".</p></blockquote>
On any reasonable interpretation of the English language the implication to be drawn from that is that at least part of the grounds for striking evidence out is that it is hearsay. Clearly that is not the intention of the Bill, which makes hearsay evidence admissible in court. If it is admissible evidence it is like any other piece of evidence to which the normal questions of competency and relevancy apply. One may strike it out if it fails those tests but if it passes those tests the fact that it is hearsay is irrelevant. If it is a civil jury trial the jury may want to take that into account when deciding what weight to give that evidence, but that is a matter for the jury at a later stage. If it goes before a jury it will do so according to the normal rules applied to all evidence. The fact that it is hearsay will not matter. The word "solely" however suggests that it does matter.</p>
