	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I hesitate to start off on the wrong foot with the Minister after his performance on Tuesday morning, but at column 488 of our proceedings on Tuesday he quoted my honourable Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) as saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I do not object to the concept of putting together the SSHA and the Housing Corporation… There is indeed a case for reform."—	<i>[Official Report,</i> 11 January 1988; Vol. 125, c.58.]</p></blockquote>
Interestingly, the Minister missed out a whole sentence in the middle of that quote. Indeed, the second part is not only in another column but on another page 	<i>of Hansard.</i> The reform referred to was the reform of the Housing Corporation, and my honourable Friend specifically said in the same sentence:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Secretary of State must not take from that any endorsement of the broad aims".—	<i>[Official Report,</i> 11 January 1988; Vol. 125, c.59.]</p></blockquote>
By that he meant the aims of the Bill, so the Minister was being a little over-enthusiastic in praying my honourable Friend in aid on that occasion.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the tenement blocks that were built in the centres of our large cities were built to a high standard. I think that in Glasgow blocks that had tiles on the walls were separated from those that did not. In Dundee, which I know much better, the separation was not always to do with tiles on the walls. Often it had to do with the amenities available. Properties with shared toilets on the stairs were not considered to be suitable facilities for families in the middle or latter part of the 20th century, and many had to be either substantially modified or knocked down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There were also many fine tenements, however, with excellent flats and very good facilities, including bathrooms and the like. Certainly, Dundee had many tenements of that kind. Young people aspiring to their first home used to obtain lettings in such tenements in the days when private landlords existed. Nearly all, if not all, the tenement blocks of that kind in Dundee were leased blocks, rented out through private landlords. That gave young people the opportunity to have homes near the city centre and close to their place of work, or they could save up to purchase, as some did, although in my recollection few could manage that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party set out as a matter of policy to destroy the opportunities for those who could not buy their homes and had to rent. It was largely the private sector that offered that facility up to and immediately after the 1939–45 war. Legislation was then brought in which made it no longer viable for landlords to let those properties because they could not maintain them, and large housing estates were built on the periphery of cities. Again I refer mainly to the city that I know well—Dundee—but the problem was the same in other cities. People were then forced on to waiting lists for houses in the peripheral housing schemes. Today, the problems of those schemes are legend. Many of them were put in the wrong place without any proper amenities and without any sense of community. Dundee has often been described as the largest village in Scotland. When I was a young man, if one walked along the high street on a Saturday or Sunday evening, the chances were that one would know every other person one met. Everyone had a feeling of belonging, but this was rapidly destroyed first, because there were no lettings available in the private sector because it ceased to exist and, secondly, because the peripheral housing schemes took people further and further away from the city.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0400">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>583</span>
One has only to look at some of the streets of Dundee which had fine houses and tenement buildings to realise that they have been removed from the market for young people looking for their first let. Many have become properties in which people have bought flats. Blackness road is a good example, as are Forest Park road north—the high numbers—Blackness avenue, Rosefield street, Forest Park road, a large part of the Perth road, almost all of the Clevington road, Baxter Park terrace, Court street, Forfar road, Victoria road, Main street and all the central streets in Broughty Ferry. I could go on for the rest of the morning, but I cite those as good examples of what we used to have in our cities and have lost but which the legislation is attempting to restore the opportunity to let.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lest is be suggested that Conservative Members do not understand the situation in Dundee—a number of honourable Members know it intimately—the tenement buildings that I have cited and many more were beautiful buildings, built to last for ever if properly looked after. The problem was that they could not be properly looked after if the rents were not economic and were insufficient to maintain the fabric of the buildings. These valuable assets either fell into disrepair or were turned into flats for sale. In recent times, with assistance from the public purse, many of the old tenements have been restored to their former state and some letting, though not nearly enough, is taking place. I am sorry to say that more of the property has gone on the market for sale, although it is good that at the earliest opportunity young people should invest in a home of their own if they can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment deals, quite properly, with those who, by virtue of the state of the market today, are forced into mulitple occupancy because they cannot afford anything else. The solution to the problem is to make it possible for them to get lets and leases on flats where they can be on their own, as no young couple setting up home for the first time wants to share with other people. The element in the Bill that will make it possible for the private sector once again to return into the leasing market is probably the most important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equally, it is important to recognise that the Labour party was responsible for the dramatic shift away from the positoin that existed before and immediately after the 1939–45 war. I believe that the Labour party was well-intentioned but, sadly, good intentions are not enough, as we all know. Legislation must be viable, practible and sensible. As a result of forcing the private sector landlord out of the market place we have today's multiple occupancy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am listening carefully to the honourable Gentleman's argument. The whole basis of the Bill seems to be moving towards a system of affordable and reasonable rents; those are the adjectives that are being used. What does the honourable Gentleman think that an affordable rent would be for a normal family in Dundee working in the local authority or in a hospital or in the jute
	<span class='label label-info column'>584</span>
industry? I do not think that his theory will stand up unless the rent was to be £40 or £50 a week, which is right over the top for the families in my area who can afford no more than the £25 or £30 that they are struggling to pay at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting question. What is needed are opportunities to get into the market place. Instead of frowning, the honourable Gentleman should listen carefully. I know the problem from personal experience, as I am sure many others do, and it is important that we should not forget what it was like when one first tried to enter the market place. When I first married in Dundee after leaving the Air Force, I could not afford the deposit required to buy a home, so we had to find a place to lease. I understand fully the difficulties and problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Gentleman asked what I think is realistic. It is realistic, first, to offer the opportunity. Secondly, the public purse should be prepared to top up for those who cannot afford the full rent; that is called housing benefit. I support the system of housing benefit because many of our citizens, certainly in the early stages of their married life, require public support to get into properties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, property should be made available. Secondly, regardless of the market price, there should be a topping-up so that the individual is not faced with finding the full amount, whatever that is. That is important. The topping-up and subsidising of the individual matters, not the building. We must care for those individuals who find themselves in that position, usually temporarily. They will progress, as we have. We can now afford to live, some in castles, some in more modest dwellings, because we have acquired the means to do so. It is an opportunity to help young people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not put a figure on it deliberately because I am a businessman. (Honourable Members:'"You are a Member of Parliament."] I have never believed that it is a politician's job to second-guess the worth of anything in the market place. That is what is wrong with politicians. We think we know better. We think that we are given gifts. That is not so. The market price is what the market requires to maintain that property in a viable condition for the rest of its expected life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the great difficulties in housing throughout the United Kingdom and especially in Scotland is the failure to channel sufficient funds through the housing coffers, whether private or public, to maintain the fabric of the property, and that is a policy of madness and lunancy, to which I have never subscribed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I follow that absolutely. There is perfect logic in what the honourable Gentleman has just said. I understand him to say that we must give people the opportunity to come into the market at whatever rent it costs to enable the landlord to get a return.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with that, and I also go along with him by saying that the way to underpin that—for those who cannot afford to pay—is through housing benefit.

	<span class='label label-info column'>585</span>
How does he square that with the changes that are to come into force on 1 April?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I square that—because I support the changes—with the fact that I do not believe in having a blanket approach. I believe that the problems of each individual case must be looked at in isolation. What is to happen on 1 April—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) and I were on television together. He holds up his hands in horror as he tells the public at large about what will happen, but with the passage of time he discovers that things will not be quite to horrific as he imagined. I believe that will also be true of the changes that are to take place on 1 April. On that date those who are genuinely in need will be assisted and those who—for whatever reason—do not meet the needs requirements should not be assisted quite properly in my view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The honourable Gentleman is going somewhat wide of the amendment. Perhaps he could confine his arguments to the amendment we are considering.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree, Mr. Martin, that it is important to stick to the wording of the amendment. We are talking about multiple occupancy, and whatever happens on 1 April will affect those in multiple occupancy. I believe my remarks are relevant because the amendment concerns the problems of those people. One of our difficulties as politicians is that sometimes we take action in one area without realising how it will affect people in other areas. I think all members of the Committee are worried about those in multiple occupancy; there is no argument about that. We must consider how the problem arose; I believe that the deliberate acts of the Labour party caused it. It is accountable; it is responsible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment as drafted is well-intentioned but it falls into the same category, sadly, as the intentions behind all the legislation that affected the market place in terms of landlords being able to charge economic rents. The real answer is to make sure that proper economic rents can be charged, in the public and private sectors. Once that is done, it is the duty and responsibility of whatever Government are in power to ensure that those who cannot pay those economic rents, by virtue of their circumstances, receive support from the public purse. That is what housing benefit does. Our job is to return to the market place the wide opportunities that previously existed in our large cities, in the lovely tenement buildings that we had and still have. If we can restore those facilities and opportunities in the centre of our towns young people will be able to get rented property close to where they work, where they can walk to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) shakes his head. One of the most enlightened things that happened in Dundee recently, as I think he will agree, was the building of properties close to the city centre, near St. Andrew's church.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>586</span>
They are a decided asset, a marvellous use of space, well laid out, and properly and attractively designed. If we had done that 40 years ago, instead of putting people in peripheral housing schemes, how much better it would have been for our city. How much better it would have been for people who would not have been faced with massive bus fares and transport charges. The Bill privides us with an opportunity to restore choice on a massive scale to the centre of our cities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment, though well-intentioned, will not achieve the aims of the honourable Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran). The honourable Gentleman probably wants the same thing as I do, but the amendment will not achieve that. I want the Committee to understand that there is no monopoly of concern. Conservative members are as anxious as other members of Committee are to give young people in multiple occupancy housing the opportunity to have a flat of their own to rent at a cost that they can meet because they will be assisted by housing benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is always a wonderful thing to behold a politician being wise after the event, and it is nice to start the morning with the honourable Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) giving his unique perspective on housing in Scotland. He painted a rosy picture of a market-based housing provision. He said that those who could not afford to pay the high market rents that would evolve would be covered by the housing benefit system. If he reads clause 64 he will find that there is no certainty that those people will be protected in that way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not give way to the honourable Member, because I wish to return to the narrow purpose of the amendments. I acknowledge the strength of his feeling about the dreadful plight of those who are trapped in a twilight zone of houses in multiple occupancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recapitulate on the debate that started late on Tuesday night when the honourable Member, with the honourable Members for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart), and for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Arbuthnot), Opposition Members and, indeed, the Minister acknowledged that there was a serious problem for people in bad housing conditions who were not protected by law. Some of us suggested that we have now an opportunity to redress that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are in Committee dealing with a Scottish housing Bill that will enable us to amend any aspect of housing law in Scotland, and the Government admit that there is a serious problem. The Opposition have suggested that there would be universal support for an initiative to bring some protection to the people involved. Such people are being severely exploited and are experiencing semi-homlelessness in houses in multiple occupation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For a variety of reasons, the Government have closed the loophole that allowed landlords to take advantage of the board and lodging system of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0402">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>587</span>
DHSS. That has led to an increase in the number of landlords who are letting shared accommodation to get round the common-law definition of tenancy. As we discovered the other night, a tenancy is defined as separate accommodation. Therefore, shared accommodation could not be covered by the existing legislation. As I understand it, there is nothing to prevent statute law superseding common law in circumstances such as this. That is what we should like to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The housing benefit system about which the honourable Member for Tayside, North spoke does not take account of the quality of accommodation provided by the landlord, who is indirectly subsidised. There is not only scope for, but ample evidence of, exploitation and profiteering, mainly in the cities where bad housing and accommodation is being let with no security and at very high rents. That is intolerable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is all-round support for action to deal with the problem and the Government have a window of opportunity to take action to bring such tenancies within the scope of the law for the first time. That could be done better on the basis of an assured tenancy as proposed in the amendments, which would be a step in the right direction, or by short assured tenancies, which would be a less satisfactory outcome. I do not like either of those new types of tenure, but they would be a step in the right direction and I implore the Minister to think postively about this suggestion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Fairbairn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Perth and Kinross)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is an honour to follow one of Scotland's responsible private landlords, was we are no doubt expected to infer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the great characteristics of the cities and towns and Scotland is that they do not have what is known as an inner-city problem. That great document "Faith in the Cities", which I was masochistic enough to read it from beginning to end, mentioned Scotland only once to say, disparagingly and condescendingly, that even in Scotland "the country towns were preferred to the cities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not our history. Until the first world war 95 per cent, of the population of Scotland lived in private rented accommodation. Even after the second world war the figure was between 60 and 70 per cent. It was terrible ping-pong match between the Conservative party and the Labour party as to who would build 150,000, 200,000 or 300,000 houses, or whatever the figure reached, which caused local authorities to abuse tenancy and to build estates such as Easterhouse and, if I dare say so in the absence of my right honourable and learned Friend the Secretary of State, Westerhailes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It would be helpful to me if the honourable and learned Gentleman would confine his remarks to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate your difficulty, Mr. Martin, but this is merely the prologue to a three-act play which will also have an epilogue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>588</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It sounds like a tragedy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important for the Committee to appreciate that families used to live in the centres of our cities—poor families, families of modest means, and also pensioners and students. When I was at the university, I had the privilege of living in a multiple-tenanted house in Royal Circus, one of the grand parts of the new town of Edinburgh, at a rent of two pounds and ten pence—proper old-fashioned pence—all found. That was because in Scotland, historically, we people lived in the centre of our cities. Those who were well of and those who were not well of were able to live side by side, as they did in the old town of Edinburgh and still do in the new town of Edinburgh, in the Tromgate in Glasgow, and so on. It was the destructive political battle which threatened that. I believe the multi-tenancy, the ability of people to live in Gorgie, Dairy and Morrison streets and Tolcross, and in India Street and Royal Circus, all a mix of the family of the people of Scotland, is important. In my view, the amendments would destroy that ability.

It is important to remember that the Scottish experience is not in any way the same as the English experience, so figures showing whether England has taken up private rented housing are irrelevant. Private rented accommodation was and still is a tradition in Scotland.

It is important to appreciate that it is not realistic to suggest that private landlords are necessarily bad and need control whole public landlords are always good. I am horrified by my experiences of local authorities as landlords. They are terribly bad, rotten landlords. Many of them are the last people of whom I should want to be a tenant. Frequently constituents wish to move to Perth, but cannot do so because they cannot get accommodation. As they do not live in Perth, they cannot get on to the local housing list, or not with any likelihood of getting a house. They therefore look for private accommodation, even multiple-occupied accommodation, but they cannot find it because the statutes that have been passed since the war make it impossible for it to be reasonable for anyone to let his house.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0403">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>589</span>
It is no good saying that there should be all sorts of new statutory regulations, which make it even more difficult, or that the tenants will be forced into some ghastly barrack room with no kettle and no window. I do not know what planning laws apply in London, but the sort of places that are sold and let, not only in the centre of London, but miles away, when London is supposed to be the great, rich, prosperous, happy and envied city in the south-east of England, would make my flesh creep if the same thing happened in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I looked at a midden this week for £82,000, five floors up. It was not one quarter the size of a piece of Cheddar cheese. [Honourable Members: "How did it smell?"] I did not make an offer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must get the matter into perspective. It is the Scottish tradition for people to live in the centre of cities. It is important for private landlords to be able to foster that great tradition again. To impose more statutory blocks, because we imagine that there are some rotten landlords, is wrong and inhumane. There are examples of exploitation in every human transaction. The great opportunity afforded by the Bill is to free the landlord and, more importantly, the tenant—the young married person who cannot afford a house—to buy or to rent a place where he wants and to avoid vast travel expenses by living in the centre of our towns and cities. The fewer statutory barriers there are—the amendments would make more statutory barriers—the less likely we are to have to publish or get the Church of Scotland to publish so effete a document as "Faith in the Cities".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first half hour of the debate has been entertaining, although it has had little to do with reality. I want to deal with some of the points raised by Conservative Members. The honourable Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) dealt with what he believed to be the ideal world of the private sector, which he located some time before the second world war. The honourable and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn) went back even further to medieval times when everyone lived together in the high street with vennels leading off it and so on. If they are honest, they will realise that the picture that they are attempting to paint for the Committee of an ideal world in a private-sector-dominated housing scheme is very partial. The honourable Member for Tayside, North mentioned Broughty ferry and some of the better streets in the Blackness road area. He did not mention the slums in Hawkhill or Overgate, where thousands of the Dundee working class were crowded into very small tenement flats which were unsanitary and by any standard totally unacceptable in a civilised world. The Labour party did not decide to set out on its own to attack the private sector. Both Labour and Tory Governments and Labour and Tory councils, including councils in Dundee of both colours, set out to alleviate the situation and rid Dundee of the city centre slums that once made it renowned throughout Europe as one of
	<span class='label label-info column'>590</span>
the places with the worst housing in this continent. It is not true, therefore, to say that it was an ideal world where everyone lived together in decent accommodation because the private sector dominated. In 1917, a Royal Commission on housing the Industrial Population of Scotland looked into the problem in cities such as Dundee and concluded that housing could be regarded as a legitimate cause of social unrest. Those are the facts of the matter, as distinct from the fiction that we have heard from Conservative Members this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The move away from the city centres into the peripheral estates which took place not only in Dundee but in many other cities in Scotland was necessitated by the slum conditions that the private sector had created in the city centres. I agree with the honourable Member for Tayside, North that the problems of the peripheral estates have to some extent become legend. At one time the Whitfield estate in my constituency had problems of vandalism, crime, disrepair and unacceptable housing conditions that were legend. The question is what should be done about them. Conservative Members seem to be suggesting that the answer is to unleash the original perpetrators of the crime—the private landlords—back into the city centres and allow them to operate untrammelled, unchecked and under no control from local authorities or central Government. We do not want to recreate the conditions of the past in Scotland but to create conditions that are relevant to the needs of the people who live in the peripheral estates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee should consider the example of Dundee district council, which has begun to tackle the real problems of peripheral estates such as Whitfield. It has started a programme whereby the blocks are being refurbished with money from the sale of former council property in Dunbar crescent, which has now become Dunbar Park. People who could not afford to buy in the private sector have been offered owner-occupation at very cheap prices. Dundee district council is also promoting the Ormiston crescent co-operative. It is initiatives of that kind which will tackle the problems in the peripheral estates, and they have been taken not by the private sector but by the district council in the public sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the honourable Gentleman believe that the private sector has any part at all to play in providing for the needs of people looking for rented accommodation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly. Dundee district council tried to involve the private sector in all those initiatives, but the private sector was not interested because there is no money to be made out of providing rented accommodation and owner-occupation for poor people. The money can be made by providing such accommodation for those who can afford it, for the yuppies and the people in the city centres such as Glasgow Merchant City. Conservative Members are arguing that the private sector should be free to tackle the housing crisis in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0404">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>591</span>
Scotland. The great danger is that it will do so by providing yuppie housing for yuppies in the centre at prices poor people cannot afford.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate is about houses in multiple occupancy. People in such accommodation continue to this day to be exploited by the private sector. Tenants have statutory rights, but Conservative Members know that landlords find their way round those rights, to exploit, in particular, young people looking for rented accommodation in the city centre. They can be evicted without notice. They do not have security of tenure, and their rents can be increased at will by landlords. Something must be done about that. The Minister suggests that no protection should be given to those people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When a local authority offers someone a house it can choose where that house will be. It can decide whether a person is to be sent to Hunter Crescent or to somewhere else in Perth. I believe that is an appalling exploitation. As to the private sector not putting the money up, the Alliance Building Society has said that it will put £600 million into private accommodation if the Bill is passed, as it will be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That £600 million will be put up for the kind of project that I described, for accommodation in the inner city for people who can afford high rents or who can afford to buy at high prices. It will not solve the problems of people in Whitfield. When the private sector was asked to become involved in the Dunbar Park project, it did not want to know. The needs of the poor will be tackled only if the district council finds the money in the public sector, and distributes it through the housing associations and the Housing Corporation. Sooner or later, Government Members will have to realise that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would object to anyone being exploited by being told where he must live. The honourable and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn) fails to point out that district councils have waiting lists, based upon need. People cannot pick and choose where they want to go if others are above them in the waiting list. People with a higher priority may have more right than they have to live in a particular area. It is not easy to say no to people. On Saturday mornings in my clinic, I meet a succession of people who are looking for houses in the better areas, but they cannot all get them. There are not enough houses to go round because the Government have prevented the district councils from building enough houses to meet the need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must begin to tackle the real housing crisis in Scotland through the public sector and through controlling the private sector. By opposing the amendment, the Minister refuses to do this. I appeal to him to show concern for the young and exploited who live in multiple occupancy tenaments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Doran 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You, Mr. Martin, were fortunate enough—or perhaps unfortunate enough—not to have been in the Chair
	<span class='label label-info column'>592</span>
on Tuesday night. If you had been, or if our co-Chairman, Mr. Lambie, were still here, you would both see that the debate this morning is quite different. On Tuesday night we were focussing on the real issues and problems, and on what the amendments intended to do. We had contributions from both sides of the Committee, and the issues were debated seriously. The Minister, and the honourable Members for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) and for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) all acknowledged the problems. We concentrated on the vulnerable groups of people who were liable to be affected. When I came to the Committee this morning, I was advised that the Minister had handed out a two-page press briefing. We have gentlemen of the press here so something significant is to be said this morning. We have had a waltz through Scottish housing from the honourable Member for Tayside, North, putting his blinkered perspective, and we have had a tango from the honourable and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn), which has taken us away from the issues we were discussing. I want to try, quickly and briefly, to bring the Committee back to that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were discussing the vulnerable groups of people who tend to end up in multiple occupancy homes. Amendment No. 248 is an attempt to close up one loophole in the existing legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we stopped on Tuesday night, we stopped so that the Minister could take account of all the views expressed by both sides of the Committee and could consider the amendment, in the tight of discussions with his civil servants on other amendments relating to multiple occupancy. I hope that he has something for us today, because we are talking about a vulnerable group of people who are being exploited. That group includes people who have previously been in care, young children and school children who have come out of local authority care; people who have come out into the community from mental handicap and psychiatric hospitals in line with Government policy to encourage more community care, and drift into sub-standard accommodation; and ex-offenders, some of them recidivist offenders, but people who need to be catered for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to consider, in the context of the Bill and the points that have been made on a number of occasions, that the White Paper—I make no apology for referring to it again, made it clear in paragraph 1.1 that one of the principal aims of the Bill was to
	<br><blockquote><p>"encourage greater individual responsibility for, and control over, the conditions in which people live".</p></blockquote>
The Minister has already admitted in our debates that tenants will lose a number of significant rights. Certain tenants will lose the right to attend meetings and influence policy and others will lose their existing right to a written lease.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall finish this point and then the Minister can reply to all four points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certain tenants will lose the right to buy, an issue which the Government have made so much of; and, finally we discovered at the last sitting that under the Bill certain tenants will lose the right of security tenancy on transfer under the Bill. Those are all significant losses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here is an opportunity for the Minister to make a significant gain for a vulnerable section of the community. I hope that he has used the day between our sittings to reflect carefully on all the points that were raised and that he will ignore the points made by Conservative Members this morning, because they are totally irrelevant to the debate that we had earlier in the week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not agree with the honourable Member that the points raised by Conservative Members were irrelevant. My honourable and learned Friend the Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn) went to the heart of the matter when he said how much the private rented sector had shrunk this century and since the second world war, to just over 6 per cent, of housing provision. He also said that people urgently wish to move to Perth but are finding difficulty in obtaining accommodation of the kind they want. My honourable Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) also touched accurately on the case for expanding the private rented sector and the importance of adequate standards of management and maintenance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) was concerned about damp housing conditions in multiple-occupancy houses. The honourable Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) referred to the slums which have been removed. One set of problems was removed when many of the slums went and the peripheral housing schemes were built, only to be replaced by another set of problems. That is why there is a vital need for the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are not the problems in peripheral estates beginning to be tackled by Labour local authorities like Dundee district council through the initiatives that I described? Does the Minister welcome the Ormiston crescent and Dunbar Park initiatives and the tenement refurbishment programme-</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Doulgas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I have already told the Committee many times, it is the Government's policy to assist. We believe that we have most to offer areas in which there is most deprivation, and we do that through the co-operative movement and housing associations. I went to Whitfield last summer and I look forward to seeing it again before long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) referred to vulnerable groups. This debate has been almost a re-run of the debate about the national house condition survey. The theme of that debate was the importance of local authorities carrying out
	<span class='label label-info column'>594</span>
their own surveys. I stress again that local authorities have substantial powers to deal with houses in multiple occupation and they should use those powers. I shall go through them again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part VIII of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 provides that lighting, ventilation, drainage and washing and cooking facilities must be adequate and that there must be an adequate means of escape in the case of fire. Local authorities have power to give grants for fire escapes and internal fire precautions. Then local authorities have the further power—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I finish setting out these powers, because they are important?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is on this particular point and it is important. It is no doubt a pure coincidence that there is a planted question on the Order Paper today from the honourable Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) on fire precautions in such properties. Will the Minister give the Committee the answer to that question now rather than later?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not seen the parliamentary question to which honourable Gentleman refers—[Honourable Members: "You wrote it."] I shall check up on that point, but I am not aware that it relates directly to what I have just said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The power to give grants is within the functions of local authorities. Under section 152 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 they have the power to make a registration scheme of the houses in multiple occupancy and to keep a record of information. They also have a power under that Act to make a control order under which a local authority takes responsibility for any house in multiple occupation where the interests of safety, welfare or health of the person or persons living in the house are under threat or the house in in bad condition. The power to apply the sanction of a control order is significant and, where circumstances justify it, local authorities should use it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Regardless of the power to impose the control order, the tenant has no secure rights in such a situation. The Minister appeared to accept on Tuesday night, when we were debating in a completely different atmosphere, that the tenant in that situation who complained to the local authority would be out on his ear as soon as it became known to the landlard. The tenant has no security and no incentive to involve the local authority. We must remember that again we are talking about vulnerable groups, who may be unaware or afraid of authorities. The Minister has the opportunity to protect these groups and it is not good enough simply to say that local authorities have all these powers, because they are totally ineffectual.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman is leading on to my next remarks. For there to be a lease, there has to be a right of exclusive occupation. That is right of common law, and we should be careful before we change it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0406">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>595</span>
Under the Public Health (Scotland) Act 1897 local authorities have the power to make byelaws. That is supplemented by the Management of Houses and Buildings in Multiple Occupation (Scotland) Regulations 1964, which spell out the details of local authorites' powers to require landlords to improve the conditions in houses of multiple occupation. The Act also given them the sanction of a charging order to cause work to be done. As I said in the debate on the national house condition survey, local authorities should use the powers available to them, when circumstances warrant it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Two points make the Minister's argument totally bogus. First, not only is the 1987 Act too little too late, but the necessary resources have not been given to local authorities. Indeed, resources to give grants have been drastically cut. Will the Minister confirm the figures that I have from the Scottish Office? Whereas in 1983–84 £243 million was available for grants, that dropped to £ 190 million in the following year, to £125 million the year after that and to £119 the year after that? In other words, the money available for the grants has been almost cut in half in three years. From where are councils supposed to get the money to give those grants?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, when the new Act was brought in in 1987, the Minister cut the money available to local authorities and removed their right to use rate funding on the current account to pay for the additional officers needed to staff and police the Act. Therefore, at the same time as bringing in an Act which would have helped people but is too late in coming, he has encouraged councils to cut their staffs and is not allowing them additional money from the rates. Will the Minister give us an undertaking that he will exempt all such expenditure from the capital cut-off and from rate capping?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The planned growth capital expenditure for housing in Scotland in 1987–88, for all the different bodies and agencies, was £720 million, and for this year is £748 million. That is an increase of £28 million. For Edinburgh and Glasgow specific grants were made available to cover the backlog on improvement grants and substantial progress has been achieved. As the honourable Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths) knows, the request he made when he came with a deputation in the summer has been acceded to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tenants do not have cause for complaint. Registration schemes mean that tenants can be protected if the local authority acts quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must emphasise that the Government share the concern of Opposition Members about many aspects of houses in multiple occupation. We do not, however, share the simplistic view that any significant improvement will be achieved by a hasty and ill-considered change in the common law regarding the nature of leases, which appears to be what the Opposition are arguing for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A characteristic of several of our earlier debates, particularly those on part I, was the Opposition
	<span class='label label-info column'>596</span>
seeking to give the false impression that complex problems can be solved overnight. I know that it is a long time since the Labour party had any practical experience of Government and that none of the Opposition Members in Committee have ever played any part in discharging the responsibilities of Government. However, they must realise that finding the right solution to difficult, practical problems involves careful consideration rather than quick action that grabs the headlines for a day but leaves the problem largely unresolved. I shall explain to the Committee how we intend to move towards a fully considered and effective approach to the problems of houses in multiple occupation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Am I right in saying that under the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987, local authorities also have powers to restrict the number of persons who may dwell in multiple occupation in any given building?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am virtually certain that my honourable and learned Friend is right and I will take the trouble to look out part VIII of the Act concerned and send it to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must emphasise again, as I did on Tuesday evening, that there is no question here of any defect in the drafting of the Bill. Nor is there any question of Opposition Members having identified a loophole in the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984, or in this Bill. Whether in houses in multiple occupation or not, people who share bedrooms or who, for any other reason, have no right to exclusive occupation, are simply not tenants. Part II is precisely about tenants. It is a matter of the common law and honourable Members should consider that the common law has grown up over many years, has been tested and tried in practice and has established this important and fundamental distinction which has proved useful and valuable in practice, after many years' experience of its operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is possible to override common law by legislation, but I urge honourable Members to consider more carefully than I suspect they may have done what would be the implications of providing, in effect, that people who occupy accommodation without an exclusive right should now, for the first time ever, be tenants. Look at the kind of people who would then become tenants in the eyes of the law. There would be people who are merely spending a night or two in a hotel, all the many people who live for a time in hostels, including youth hostels, patients in nursing homes and hospitals, old people and children in residential homes—whether run by local authorities or by the private sector—women in the valuable refuges which the voluntary organisations have established over the past few years and many more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly note what my honourable and learned Friend has said. He will have knowledge of that from his extensive legal experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition have scarcely considered the chaotic effects that would result from the change that they prepose. No doubt it is well meant, but it is poorly thought out. I cannot emphasise strongly enough that the Bill is about the rights and duties of tenants and landlords. Those are not just vague expressions to be used to refer to anyone who lives in a house that he does not own and to the owner of the house respectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many honourable Member may feel that in an ideal world we could find legislative time to protect the rights of all the persons that I have mentioned and to try to put right many other problems which all honourable Members could identify without difficulty. But the Bill—to take a few housing matters at random—is not about the rights of hotel clients or, to come closer to the concerns of honourable Gentlemen, the right of lodgers. Therefore, such a fundamental change in the present position should not be made in a housing Bill. Even if it could be, it would be foolish to rush into an ill-considered amendment on the basis of a very partial view of one problem on which honourable Gentlemans fastened to the exclusion of all the connected ones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say "a partial view" because honourable Gentlemen have presented a sterotype of homes in multiple occupation and their occupants. It is simply a caricature of the true situation to suggest that all houses in multiple occupation consist of grossly unsatisfactory accommodation, with the elderly, those with various social problems and the young unemployed all crammed in, two or three to a bedroom and being exploited by a ruthless landlord.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me give honourable Gentlemen some facts from a useful report published in April 1987 by the Scottish Council for Single Homeless. That report, although about a relatively small survey, covered houses in multiple occupation in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee, Renfrew and Kirkcaldy. In response to a questionnaire, some 40 per cent, of the occupants—this is an amalgam of the reported figures—of houses in multiple occupation had no criticisms of their accommodation or suggestions on how it might be improved. To put if simply, they were perfectly happy with what they had.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another figure is perhaps constructive: of the sample, nearly 60 per cent, were economically active; in other words, they had a job of some kind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

was dished out to people in houses of multiple occupancy and that he got back questionnaires from the residents? In that circumstance the only people, who will be in the slightest interested in taking part in and responding to a survey are those in semi-reasonable conditions. How will the validity of the survey be demonstrated to the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The survey was carried out by the Scottish Council for Single Homeless by Hector Currie and Barbara Miller. Appendix C, on pages 89 and 90, give the findings. I shall cite one or two to the honourable Member to give him a picture. Finding 27 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Residents were asked what they disliked about their HMO and 52 per cent, said there was nothing they disliked. However, the poor quality of the dwelling was mentioned by 17 per cent, and the lack of privacy was noted by 13 per cent."</p></blockquote>
Finding 28 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"With regard to the landlord, 84 per cent, of residents reported no problems."</p></blockquote>
I accept that it is not a survey of every house in multiple occupation in Scotland, but it is a sample of Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee, Renfrew and Kirkcaldy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The phrase "houses in multiple occupation" is liable to conjure up a standard picture which often does not correspond to reality. The common suggestion that emerges from surveys is that people would like a larger communal cooking area and improved cooking facilities. Where there are problems, as I accepted earlier, local authorities should take the necessary action within their already extensive powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also remind honourable Members that, technically, such obviously harmless and acceptable housing arrangements as a number of students sharing a flat or people living in a commune would count in the statistics as houses in multiple occupation. As a rule, however, it would be ridiculous to present those people as in any way deprived or specially in need of the protection of the law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What steps has Edinburgh district council taken since the passing of Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 to improve conditions in the doss houses in the Grassmarket?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Measures have been taken. I will find out the up-to-date position, because it is about a year since that matter was rasied with me, and will let my honourable and learned Friend know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
None of what I have just said denies that there are problems with some houses in multiple occupation and that some occupants of such houses need all the help that we can give them to improve the circumstances in which they live. There is much more to consider than the narrow fact that some occupants share bedrooms. It is more important to do what can be done to improve the conditions in which people live, rather than devise a way to change the legal status of such people. If the private rented sector is expanded, the worst conditions should
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0408">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>599</span>
gradually disappear in any case as a wider range of houses to rent, over a range of rents, becomes available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other aspects must be considered. Housing in multiple occupation involves complicated planning considerations. The effect on the amenity of the neighbourhood of badly-run, squalid or grossly overcrowded houses in multiple occupation is adverse. What is needed, rather than the present proposal of sweeping away a fundamental distinction of common law—which, as I have explained, would involve throwing out the baby with the bath water—is a proper consultation exercise, taking the views of all concerned, including the local authorities, on what exactly needs to be done and could be done without legislation. I must emphasise that to declare an intention to consult fully on this question is not at all the same thing as entering into a commitment to further legislation, but we shall look carefully at the results of the consultation process, which will take place later this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have given honourable Members an account of the wide-ranging powers that local authorities already have, and many of the problems probably arise not from the inadequacy of those powers but from the fact that they have been largely unfamiliar to many local authorities and so have hardly been tried at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is suggesting that local authorities are unfamiliar with the powers in the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman is quite right. The provisions come in the Housing (Scotland) Act 1966, and the consolidation is to assist local authorities—and anyone else—by making it easier for them to look up the provisions that would be of assistance to them.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my honourable Friend confirm that all local authorities employ very expensive lawyers whose job is to ensure that the authority is properly informed on measures that have gone through Parliament?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I want to move on.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must therefore again urge the Committee to reject the amendment and to accept that the rejection of the amendment does not imply any disregard of the problems that honourable Members have described. The amendment simply would be of no real help. It would create more problems than it could possibly solve, and it is quite inappropriate in the context of the aims of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Someone has got at the Mnister since the last sitting of the Committee, because a transformation seems to have taken place. On Tuesday night the Minister was all sweetness and light. He said that there was a serious problem and that he was aware of the abuses in this sector. Yet on this Thursday morning, with a beautifully typed out, brief which was released to the press, he is saying that everything is alright and that there is no need to alter the legislation. I am afraid that many grossly exploited people in some of the grimmest accommodation in Scotland will feel very angry and disappointed at the Minister's reaction to the debate this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister seeks to dismiss our suggestions, saying that in an ideal world we would be able to deal with all the problems. No one can call Scotland an ideal world today. The honourable and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Firbairn) spoke about St. Andrew's House in Glasgow. I suspect that most Scottish people are much more anxious about St. Andrew's House, in Edinburgh, that notorious house in multiple occupancy in Scotland, where a beleagured little clique is trying to ram its prejudices down the throats of the Scottish people. The Minister is clearly rather uncomfortable in that company, and he had better watch out, because the honourable Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker), and perhaps even the honourable Member for Perth and Kinross are ready and willing to take over his position in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister spoke of the powers of local authorities to intervene and to take action in cases of seriously substandard housing. My honourable Friends who have experience in local authorites have made abundantly clear—"that the trouble is that local authorities do not have the resources to carry out the duties that Parliament has placed upon them. We are not talking simply about the condition of houses. The Minister has cited evidence from the report of the Scottish Council for the Single Homeless that not all properties are in a bad condition. But he knows that a significant and disturbing minority of those properties are in a shocking condition, and that action should be taken to improve them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate is about the question of security of tenure and protection for single people. If we cut through all the layers of verbiage, we see that the Minister has fallen back on the common law position that those people are not tenants. It will not be very comforting to those tenants to know that the Minister is saying that the cherished principle of common law in Scotland is that people in houses in multiple occupancy are not tenants and have no rights. Their only right is to go to the local authority, which might be able to do something about the condition of their housing, but they can do nothing to protect their security of tenure or the rent levels that apply in those areas. There is no protection for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's reply today fell a long way below par. I wish that he would consider the rather more sober comments made by honourable Members on
	<span class='label label-info column'>602</span>
both sides of the Committee during our debate last Tuesday night. He should also listen to the representations from people in Scotland—from local authorities, Shelter, the Scottish Council for the Single Homeless—all of whom were encouraged to believe that the Government might be prepared to take some action when the Minister said last Tuesday night that he acknowledged that there was a serious problem. However, the Minister has evidently been got at and has decided that nothing shall be done to protect those people and that that minority of exploited people in Scotland shall be condemned to remain in a twilight existence without any protection, not even the limited protection that would be afforded by assured tenancies in the future. That was a disgraceful reply from the Minister, and I hope that my honourable Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) will press the amendment to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the Minister for getting his press briefing on the record more or less unscathed. But the areas where he was scathed made me rather depressed. I was anxious to question the Minister about his evidence for local authorities unfamiliarity with a measure that has been on the statute book for 21 years. It is appalling if he has any real evidence that local authorities are unfamiliar with the terms of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1966, which were consolidated in the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987. Given the detailed nature of those powers, if local authorities are unfamiliar with them it is up to the Scottish Office to do something about it. However, if that is simply a phrase that he has thrown into the debate to emphasis a point without any real evidence to back it up, we should hear more from the Minister about that, because that would be fairly appalling conduct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister mentioned the common law. I shall repeat a point that I made in the more sober atmosphere on Tuesday night, when we were looking at these issues far more seriously—at least, Conservative Members were looking at them far more seriously. The whose function of the House is to make laws, to legislate, and in many cases—in most cases in fact—that means trampling all over the common law. That is done because we recognise that there are gaps and problems that need to be dealt with. Members on both sides of the Committee have highlighted the problems that those vulnerable groups face, and it is in that spirit that the amendments were moved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that we have seen a conversion—not quite on the road to Damascus—but we have certainly seen a conversion in the Minister's attitude. I can only relate the way that the whole matter has been dealt with today to the Minister's problem about which we have been reading in the press recently. That is his own image problem. He is sitting now with the full Scottish Front Bench beside him—the forceful macho men of the Scottish Office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has my honourable Friend noticed that the Secretary of State has come back very quickly this morning? I wonder whether he has been

	<span class='label label-info column'>603</span>
flung out of the Cabinet and, if so, whether we shall be told.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the Cabinet will have had a chance to read this morning's 	<i>Scotsman</i> yet. While considering his image problem and attempting to acquire that foreceful macho image that he believes his colleagues on the Front Bench have, the Minister has taken the opportunity to trample all over the needs and aspirations of a vulnerable group of people. I find that depressing, and I have no intention of withdrawing the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill is about housing, and if the honourable Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) considers that his image or that of his honourable Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) is more important than the issue of housing in Scotland, it is unworthy of him. It fills us with immense confidence, that the Government are putting forward solutions to Scotland's housing problems, which the Labour party has totally failed to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Gentleman wanted evidence. There is some evidence. Only in the past year have we seen evidence of Scottish authorities coming forward with draft registration schemes for houses in multiple occupation. Local authorities have lawyers who look up the Scottish housing Acts; they should be familiar with them. They may be less familiar with the operation of the Acts. I had no alternative but to spell out those powers, as I have done today, and to urge local authorities to use them whenever the circumstances justify it. I have no doubt that that is the appropriate procedure. Necessary consultation on the matter should take place comprehensively later this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said earlier, the report of the Scottish Council for Single Homeless is significant in this connection. In finding 28 it says.
	<br><blockquote><p>"With regard to the landlord, 84 per cent, of residents reported no problems."</p></blockquote>
We must put the matter into perspective and go into it in depth. That is precisely what we shall do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's brief today has shown a degree of either incompetence or dishonesty. It is hardly surprising, when he seems to lump together all the public spending, bar the SDA money, and implies that £700 million, or a fraction of it, is available to try to tackle the problem. It is little wonder that local government finance has been taken out of his hands and placed in those of the Minister of State, the honourable Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale (Mr. Lang).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the past three years we have seen a cut by more than a half in the money available to local government to pay for the higher grants that the Minister mentioned. There was a cut of 22 per cent, three years ago, and in the following year of 34 per cent.; last year the cut was 5 per cent. He has not guaranteed, as I asked him to do, that local
	<span class='label label-info column'>604</span>
authorities' spending in respect of grants or staff needed to enforce the regulations will be exempted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that the list of powers is largely bogus. Conservative Members do not like extending powers to local authorities or to anyone else; they have tried—and have frequently said that they wished to do it—to raze, lift and abolish powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The powers are bogus because councils begged the Government to give them appropriate powers and resources. They have given them neither the appropriate powers nor the resources. Indeed, housing support grant, which goes towards the hostel element of a council's budget—that is, the money to pay for those properties in the Grassmarket to which the honourable and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn) alluded—has been cut. Now 31 authorities in Scotland do not get a penny to help those properties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have seen this morning an incompetent or dishonest performance by the Minister. We know that money to tackle the problem has been cut. Local government expenditure has been constrained. The Government want to cut staffing levels in local authorities, whereas more environmental health officers are needed to enforce the legislation and more staff are needed to help the housing departments to take out control orders for houses in multiple occupation. We know that the Government want none of that; they have given spurious and bogus powers and no resources. It would be more honest for the Minister to admit that instead of tossing out meaningless figures that do not relate to the matter that we have been disussing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question Accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Without going over the ground that we covered in the previous debate, I want to put it on record that we are deeply dissatisfied with the Government's approach to this matter. We believe that more could and should be done to afford protection to people in this type of property, and we intend to return to this subject at a later stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is not point in my repeating the same arguments, but I shall say what the clause does. It explains how the new regime will apply to lettings in which a tenant shares some of his accommodation with another person other than
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0411">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>605</span>
his family. The new assured tenancy arrangements will not apply to any letting where the tenant shares the whole of his accommodation with another tenant or tenants. That represents no change from present arrangements. But if the tenant has the exclusive occupation of at least some accommodation, the letting of that separate accommodation will qualify as an assured tenancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2) provides that the assured tenant who shares some of the living accommodation will have the right to continue to use that shared accommodation on the original terms of the tenancy, so long as he has an assured tenancy of separate accommodation. The only variation allowed is of the number or identity of the people using the shared accommodation, but that will be allowed only if the tenancy agreement expressly permits the landlord to make such a change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise the worries of the honourable Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) about the requirement for a tenant to have exclusive occupation of some part of his accommodation to qualify as assured. Like the honourable Gentleman, I have watched the growth of houses in multiple occupation with concern. Many of them are perfectly satisfactory places in which to live, but in others landlords do not offer any exclusive accommodation to their tenants, thus opening the door to harassment, excessive rents and lack of security. I assure the honourable Gentleman that I shall keep that very much in mind in the the consultation process that will take place later in the year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the clause is necessary. It protects the tenant who has the exclusive right to occupy some accommodation—say, a bedroom and a living room—but shares other rooms—say, the kitchen and bathroom. To remove the clause would be to remove that protection, so I urge the Committee to support its retention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again we deal with the clause fairly quickly, but I should be grateful if the Minister said a word or two about the status of a sub-tenant where the tenant holds the assured tenancy. I assume that the determination of an assured tenancy should apply to the person who is actually living in the property. I am anxious about the possibility that where a person has, on paper, sub-let an assured tenancy to somebody else, that sub-tenant might find himself with no rights. Perhapse the Minister can clarify that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the honourable Gentleman that the sub-tenant would
	<span class='label label-info column'>606</span>
also be an assured tenant and subject to the protection of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause explains how the new regime will apply to lettings where the tenant sub-lets part of the accommodation. It provides that any sub-letting of part of the house, whether or not it includes the use of shared accommodation, will be treated as an assured tenancy if it meets the usual requirements for an assured tenancy and that any part of the house excluded from a sub-letting will remain subject to—the original assured tenancy agreement. The effect of subsection (1) therefore, is that sub-tenants who rent part of a house, like principal tenants who partly sub-let, will have the protection of the new regime. That was what gave rise to the honourable Gentleman's question. If a tenant sub-lets the whole of his accommodation, that sub-letting will also be treated as an assured tenancy, simply because "tenant" is defined in clause 50 as including "sub-tenant".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 303, in page 10, line 30, leave out from 'house' to 'shall' in line 31.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a probing amendment. I want to establish the sequence of events between an assured tenancy, a contractual tenancy and a statutory assured tenancy. There is a case for giving tenants full rights as soon as the assured tenancy agreements run out, without having a limbo stage in between. How does the Minister envisage that the system will work?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Tenants must enjoy security of tenure. Clause 16 introduces those provisions in the Bill. The words that the amendment would remove are there simply to cover security of tenure even if there is no contractual tenancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If an assured tenancy is terminated, both landlord and tenant may agree to enter into a new contractual assured tenancy. If that happens, they will have agreed the terms on which that tenancy should operate. The tenant will have the security afforded by the new tenancy contract, so he will not need the protection of clause 16.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, however, on termination of the original tenancy agreement, the landlord and tenant do not agree a new contractual assured tenancy, the tenant will need some protection, and that is where clause 16 comes in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Honourable Members may be worried that a landlord may force a tenant to enter into a new contractual tenancy on unfavourable terms. Clause 16 and the associated provisions make it clear that if the tenant has doubts in those circumstances, he is under no obligation to agree, as he has the right to continue under a statutory assured tenancy. I believe
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0412">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>607</span>
that the fears of the honourable Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) are unfounded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that that was a helpful reply. I hope that the Minister's introductory words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Tenants must enjoy security of tenure"—</p></blockquote>
will be emblazoned in large letters on town halls and everywhere else in Scotland. That seems to be at variance with a number of terms used elsewhere in the Bill but if that is what he wants let us hope that he gets it. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 165, in page 10, line 31, after second 'to', insert 'section 12 above and'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is designed to make it clear that a statutory assured tenancy existing on the termination of an assured tenancy must continue to fulfil the conditions necessary for any tenancy to be assured. The major security of tenure provision of the Bill is set out in clause 16. A tenant who has had an assured tenancy, which has been terminated by the issue by the landlord of a notice to quit, will have the right to a statutory assured tenancy on the same terms, unless his landlord is able legally to regain possession of the house. As honourable Members will remember, clause 12 sets out the conditions that must be met for a tenancy to be assured. They are that the tenant must be an individual—in other words a real and not merely a legal person—that the house being let must be the tenant's only or principal home, and that the tenancy is not in one of the exempted categories in schedule 4.

In a case where a statutory assured tenancy has arisen, it would be extremely unfair on a landlord if he could not regain possession of his house if the tenancy is assigned to a company, or if the tenant stops using the house as his main residence. It was always our intention that the protection of the assured tenancy provisions should apply only to a statutory tenant who meets the conditions in clause 12. Amendment No. 165 puts that matter beyond doubt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was under the happy illusion that amendment No. 165 and the remaining Government amendments on the clause were, broadly speaking, drafting amendments, but the Minister indicated that they go slightly further than that. I am advised that they will do no further harm to the position of tenants, so I shall say no more about them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 166, in page 10, line 43, leave out "court" and insert "sheriff".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 180, 183, 193, 197, 198, 199, 200, 201, 203 and 204.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>608</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This group of amendments is designed to simplify the Bill. Since the sheriff is to have jurisdiction, it is simpler to replace all references to the court with references to the sheriff, rather than to include in the Bill a separate clause on jurisdiction or a definition of what is meant by "court". They are technical drafting amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amen to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 304, in page 10, line 47, leave out from "shall" to "notice" in line 48 and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"be required to give him one month's".</p></blockquote>
The amendment relates to subsection (3), which deals with the question of security of tenure. Subsection (3) reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Notwithstanding anything in the terms and conditions of tenancy of a house being a statutory assured tenancy, a landlord who obtains an order for possession of the house as against the tenant shall not be required to give him any notice to quit."</p></blockquote>
That implies that in those circumstances the tenant would have to go out the door forthwith. The amendment would provide for one month's notice, which would give the unfortunate tenant at least some time to find alternative accommodation. It would also give the local authority—which, as the Minister keeps telling us, has all the responsibility if none of the funds to do the job—time to find alternative accommodation if necessary under the homeless persons' procedures. I am alarmed by any legislative provision that allows for immediate and instant eviction; that is why we are moving the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise honourable Members' concern that tenants with statutory assured tenancies will not receive adequate notice that they are under threat of eviction. That is clearly what lies behind amendment No. 304. However, if a tenant has a statutory assured tenancy he must have been served with a notice to quit in order to terminate his original contractual assured tenancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not accept that it should be a requirement that a further notice to quit should be issued when the landlord has legitimate grounds for possession of the house after the statutory assured tenancy has arisen. To impose such a condition would be unfair. I know that the honourable Member does not believe in being over-fair to landlords, but the Government believe strongly that it would be wrong to erect traps for landlords that might prevent them from obtaining possession of their house when they have legitimate grounds for doing so—for example, when they need the house to live in themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the honourable and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn) keeps reminding me, I am a landlord, so I would not necessarily want to be unfair to landlords. I am anxious about the fact that the Bill seems to be altering the balance in an alarming way in favour of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0413">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>609</span>
the landlord and against the tenant. I accept the technical point, that it is a little silly to issue one notice to quit and then go to court and then have to issue yet another notice to quit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister at least accept the spirit of the amendment? I can imagine that in a case like this a tenant might go to a court genuinely believing that he is likely to win his case, and might plan his family affairs accordingly. He might be advised by learned counsel that he is likely to win his case, but he then goes to court and finds that he must move all his furniture, bag and baggage, out of his property within a matter of hours. Is there not a case for allowing at least a brief period of grace to enable families to make alternative arrangements for accommodation? Otherwise, we shall be back to the bad old days, with the ugly scenes of households and their furniture out on the pavement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the most appropriate place to raise this point is on clause 19. I shall certainly keep in mind what the honourable Gentleman has said. Perhaps we may return to it on clause 19.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I am sorry; that is not quite good enough. We are trying to make rapid progress. Off the cuff, I am not sure whether we have tabled an amendment on clause 19 that would raise this point. I think that the Minister has implicitly acknowledged that none of us wants to see tenants and their families and furniture out on the street unnecessarily, and that there are circumstances where a brief period of grace would be justified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Arbuthnot 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wanstead and Woodford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under clause 20(2)(b) the sheriff will be given power to postpone the date of possession. Does the honourable Gentleman not think that is an adequate power?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect to the honourable Gentleman, I think that he and I are talking about different categories of assured tenancy. He is in the same difficulty as we are. We are all in uncharted waters here. This is a new type of tenancy system for Scotland, which I do not think exists in England yet, so the honourable Gentleman can be forgiven for being as confused as the rest of us on this subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot accept the general mechanism set out in the amendment. I think that the honourable Gentleman recognises that there would be problems with that. I can reconsider the general question of adequacy of length of time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With that helpful assurance, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>610</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some of my honourable Friends may wish to take part in this debate, because the clause deals with the crucial subject of security of tenure for tenants on assured tenancies. I want to put one point on the record, and I shall be grateful if the Government will admit that this is what they are doing. As I see it, the Bill undermines and reduces the existing levels of security of tenure enjoyed by tenants in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A minute or two ago the Minister prefaced his remarks by saying that it was important that tenants should enjoy security of tenure, but he is sitting on a Government Front Bench in this Committee advancing legislation whose prime object is to reduce existing levels of security of tenure. The Minister knows the Opposition's strong feelings on the subject. This is a rather sad and squalid moment in the legislative history of this Government in Scotland. It would be wrong if such were to pass unnoticed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am very much alarmed at the prospect of increasing numbers of evictions taking place in Scotland in the coming years while the Bill is on the statute book. I have already placed on record the fact that landlords who seek to take advantage of this legislation, which the Government are railroading on the Scottish statute book, should be warned that at the earliest possible opportunity a Labour Government, either in this place or in a Scottish Assembly will, urgently introduce legislation to restore not only a reasonable level of security of tenure for tenants but also rent controls. Therefore, if any cowboys are thinking of taking advantage of these provisions they have had fair warning from the Opposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must be clear about this I said that all tenants should obviously have security of tenure, but even local authority tenants can be evicted on certain grounds, and the grounds on which the court must order possession are given in schedule 5, together with further grounds, on which the court may order possession, which are discretionary. We shall discuss those grounds thoroughly when we reach that part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the first clause in the group of clauses dealing with security of tenure for assured tenancies. Overall, those clauses are intended to ensure that no assured tenant will be evicted without good cause, a reaonable period of notice and due process of law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 16 is the proof that the new assured tenancy arrangements will continue to offer security of tenure to tenants. The clause deals with what happens when an assured tenancy is terminated. In those circumstances, a statutory assured tenancy will arise so long as the conditions for a tenancy to be assured continue to apply. The only way a landlord will be able to gain possession is by obtaining a court order when one of the grounds in schedule 5 is satisfied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A statutory assured tenancy that has arisen on the termination of a contracted assured tenancy continues all the terms and conditions of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0414">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>611</span>
contractual tenancy. In particular, the tenant will still enjoy the right to occupy the house unless or until the landlord obtains possession by means of a court order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was all very convoluted legal stuff. Landlords have been making representations to the Government that they do not like letting property because it is too difficult to put tenants out of their houses, and the Bill is intended to increase the amount of rent that landlords can extract from their tenants, and reduce the security of tenants, because it will be easier in many circumstances for landlords to evict tenants. The Minister may mince his words as much as he likes; that is what the Bill is about and that is why we do not like it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard from the backwoodsmen from the nether regions of Tayside. I exonerate my honourable Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) from that structure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Dundee is not in the backwoods.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course not. Who could ever suggest that Dundee was in the backwoods? The honourable Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) and the honourable and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn) have said that with the advantages created for landlords in the Bill floods of new property will become available for people to rent. We fear that the people who take advantage of such tenancies in such properties will in many cases—too many cases—be likely to fall into a trap that they cannot afford, a trap in which their families will be in intolerably insecure conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not suggest that the Committee should vote against the clause because it at least establishes limited security of tenure. However, I give notice that we intend to return to the detailed grounds in the schedule, and I reiterate that the Labour majority in Scotland sooner or later—I hope sooner—will re-establish a fair degree of security for tenants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman must know, as a landlord himself, that there is a balance between the security of tenure of the tenant and the ability of the landlord to get rid of a tenant if he so wishes. I am sure that the honourable Gentleman will have had that problem himself at Paxton. Many people have, especially in the rural community. If one has an unsatisfactory agricultural tenant, it is difficult to adjust the two. That is an aspect of human conflict. But one must not overemphasise the fact that landlords are bad guys and tenants are good guys. There are good tenants and good landlords, bad tenants and bad landlords, and there must be a balance, because they both have interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the honourable and learned Gentleman. Our position is that the balance will go sadly adrift and that weaker people will suffer under the Bill. In my constituency experience, the problems of agricultural tenancies or tenancies of farm cottages have had more to do with
	<span class='label label-info column'>612</span>
unsatisfactory agricultural landlords than with unsatisfactory agricultural tenants. All honourable Members could cite examples.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stress that it is not my purpose in the Committee or elsewhere to say that all private landlords are bad; that is patently not true. But it is disturbing that a fringe element has an appalling record. We fear that the Government are setting out to encourage that fringe element of private landlords in rural and urban areas. That is irresponsible and cruel and could cause great insecurity and misery for many families in Scotland. That is why Opposition Members are determined to reverse the legislation at the earliest opportunity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was concerned to hear the Minister say that there would be no grounds for anyone to worry if the clause was accepted. It relates to schedule 5. The Minister said that there would have to be good cause for the landlord to gain possession of a flat; even with good cause, it could not be achieved except through the due process of law and by a court order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Grounds 1 to 11 are grounds on which a court must order possession. The sheriff has no discretion whether to grant possession. It is a matter of proving in the sheriff court that one of the grounds has been met; the sheriff must grant possession to the landlord.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ground 1 is where
	<br><blockquote><p>"suitable alternative accommodation is available for the tenant or will be available for him when the order for possession takes effect."</p></blockquote>
That could easily be proved in court; the sheriff would have no discretion but to grant possession. It means that the tenant may be expected to move from an area where he has been settled for a long time, and where he has friends and relatives and feels secure. He may be expected to move to another area where none of those characteristics apply. That would be an unfortunate experience for elderly people. My parents are very elderly and live in a Glasgow district council house. When the house was modernised, they had to move from one part of the estate to another; it was a distressing experience. They moved into an entirely new area that was not quite as nice as where they used to live. They found it hurtful and distressing, and they were pleased to move back.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister seemed to suggest that tenants of private sector landlords could find themselves in the same position: they could be moved into an area where they would be vulnerable and deeply unhappy; they would have no control over the matter as long as the landlord proved in the sheriff court that he had offered them suitable alternative accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same applies to ground 11. On this ground, the sheriff must grant possession to the landlord
	<br><blockquote><p>"whether or not any rent is in arrears on the date on which proceedings for possession are begun, the tenant has persistently delayed paying rent which has become lawfully due."</p></blockquote>
The word is "delayed", not "failed" or "refused" to pay rent. It does not matter if the tenant is completely up to date with his rent. The landlord may go to the sheriff court and prove that over a period of time the tenant did not pay the rent on the day on which it was due, but a week or two weeks late. It is common for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0415">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>613</span>
people who do not have much money to be constantly in arrears with the rent. If the landlord can prove that a tenant has been consistently late with the rent—it does not matter if he paid it eventually—the tenant can be kicked out. That is a substantial weakening of the security of tenure of tenants in the private sector. That is what the clause is about and that is why the Minister is attracting the private sector back into housing. He is weakening the rights of tenants because he knows that that is the only condition on which the private sector will return.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can imagine a private sector landlord who has a tenant who is not well off and delays paying his rent. Through a series of changes the landlord thinks that he can find a tenant who is prepared to pay a higher rent. It would be very easy for him to go to the sheriff court and get the tenant kicked out on ground 11. The sheriff would have no discretion in the matter. So long as it was proved that the poor tenant had been a bit late paying his rent, he would be out in the streets or into a totally unsuitable place, and the person who was prepared to pay the higher rent would be in his place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman has a touching lack of faith in the sheriff courts of Scotland. I think that the word "suitable" in ground 1 means that if it was suggested that somebody who lived in, for instance, Trongate in Glasgow had a suitable alternative in Blackhill, the court would hold that it was not suitable because it was not equivalent. Similarly, under ground 11, the question is not simply whether there are any rents in arrears, if the postal order has not arrived on Friday; it is whether
	<br><blockquote><p>"the tenant has persistently delayed paying rent which has become lawfully due."</p></blockquote>
It is the concept of "persistently" that the court would interpret, and I believe that it would interpret it with equity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, with regard to suitable accommodation, the honourable and learned Gentleman draws a distinction between Trongate and Blackhill I wonder whether sheriffs would be prepared to say that Blackhill was all right for the tenants who lived there but not all right for tenants who had come from somewhere else in Glasgow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do any sheriffs live there?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps sheriffs live in Blackhill, but I doubt it very much. The honourable and learned Gentleman is keen to have a definition of persistently. The Minister knows exactly what "persistently" means, because as I understand it there is no discretion to the sheriff under grounds 1 to 11 possession for. These are grounds which he must concede if they are proven. How will the sheriff interpret "persistently"? Does the Minister know? Will he be giving sheriffs advice on how to interpret the word "persistently"? Does it mean once a month, every week or once every three months? Exactly what does it mean, or is it purely open to the sheriff's discretion?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The working class in Scotland has had little cause
	<span class='label label-info column'>614</span>
to put their faith in sheriffs in the past and I have little cause to put my faith in their ability to protect tenants from unscrupulous landlords through this sort of legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must confess that I am still struggling with the concept of the assured tenancy, and I struggle the more when I think back to the Minister's comments at an earlier sitting, when he advised us that in England the assured tenancy concept has been a resounding failure and that only 3,000 of this new form of tenancy has been created in the last three years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a most important distinction. Under the mark 1 assured tenancy system in England landlords had to be registered by the Department of the Environment, and therefore a safety net existed. The Government are doing away with all that, and what we are talking about here has nothing to do with the assured tenancies known in England.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept my honourable Friend's point, but he will forgive me while I still struggle with the concept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I look at clause 16 in the context of the Bill, I become even more concerned about the impact that it will have in Scotland. We have considerable experience of landlords who attempt to evade their responsibilities under the rent legislation. They have devised all sorts of schemes and fiddles. We have seen the licences, the services, the bread and the rolls, the manufacturered relative and the manufactured cases of the landlord needing the house for himself or his family. They will not need to get up to those tricks any more, because they will have all sorts of other means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause purports to give some security of tenure, but I wonder how many landlords will use this provision and how many will need to use it, because it would not be in a landlord's interest to create a new assured tenancy. It may be in his interest to create a new short assured tenancy, because he does not need to go to great lengths to get the tenant out: he does not need to prove all the items in schedule 5, even though they are considerably watered down from the Rent Act provisions. Under clause 30 the landlord simply has to prove the sheriff
	<br><blockquote><p>"that the short assured tenancy has reached its ish".</p></blockquote>
Assuming that there is a written contract, although the Minister does not want one, all that the landlord has to do is how that the short tenancy has expired.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have experience of other legislation in which short tenancies run on, and in common law in Scotland there is the concept of tacit relocation, which would allow a short assured tenancy to run on. We have already discussed that. Why would the landlord need to bother with the assured tenancy when he can have a short assured tenancy? I see no reason why landlords would want to give such tenancies, although I see that there will be a place for this form of tenancy with housing associations and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0416">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>615</span>
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My honourable Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) mentioned the impact of schedule 5, in particular ground 11, which is the mandatory obligation on the sheriff to order possession when rent arrears are persistently delayed. I have fears about how it will operate in practice. As a qualified Scottish lawyer, the Minister will be aware that if a contract exists—presuming my first fear about whether this provision will be used has proved unfounded—the court will recognise the contract between the landlord and the tenant. It will not take into account any other extraeous issues—for example, that the tenant's rent is paid by housing benefit. In my experience, there are considerable delays in the payment of housing benefit to landlords, who frequently complain about this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will that affect the private tenant who is reliant on housing benefit? It is not his fault but that of the local authority that the rent has not been paid. The local authority may decide that it does not want to pay out housing benefit on a weekly basis but would rather pay it monthly or three monthly. In those circumstances, what protection does the tenant have, given a bold statement about security of tenure on the one hand and the provisions of ground 11 of schedule 5 on the other? The Oppositon have many well-founded fears that this has nothing to do with housing in Scotland but everything to do with creating a new investment opportunity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984, there are many grounds on which the court either may order possession or must order possession, and there are considerably more grounds now in existence than are suggested in the Bill. Therefore, to suggest that this is a huge departure is not the case. We shall consider the grounds very carefully when we reach schedule 5, especially grounds 1 and 11.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, the grounds that will relate to the assured tenancies are those set out in schedule 5. I accept that under the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984 a far greater number of grounds are available to a tenant under a secure protected tenancy. Is it not the Government's position that they are moving from the terms of tenancy granted in the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984 towards assured tenancies? Therefore, is this not just waffle? The Government are attempting to shift away from protection under the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984 to this protection, and there will come a time when tenancies under the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984 and under the Housing (Scotland) Acts will have terminated and there will be no secure tenancies left. Therefore we must look at what the present Bill proposes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point that I was making is that there are more grounds for possession in the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984, and from the way honourable Members were speaking it sounded as though grounds for possession had suddenly been dreamt up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>616</span>
The honourable Gentelman referred to written contracts and leases. I said at our last sitting that I would look at that matter. He also asked why anyone would wish to offer short assured tenancies. That market is obviously more limited, but as an example, a civil engineer may have to work for a year or so on road projects in the middle east. If he wants to let his house while he is away, clearly he will wish to do so on a short assured tenancy. The kind of person who might wish to take him up on that offer would be somebody who wished to come to work temporarily in that area before possibly moving somewhere else. Clearly that is a much more limited application than an assured tenancy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the Minister misunderstands my point, which was that there is no incentive for a landlord to create an assured tenancy and to bother with all terms of schedule 5 and everything that has to be proved in court, when all he needs to do is to write a short-term assured tenancy contract with a short time limit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no incentive for a tenant who wishes to reside in a house for a considerable period of time to opt for a short assured tenancy. I would not advise any prospective tenant to opt for a short assured tenancy if he wished to have a house to live in for a number of years. There will be no rent control during the period of an assured tenancy. The short assured tenancy will usually have a lower rent because its duration will be much more limited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) asked whether he had tabled an amendment in relation to the matter we discussed earlier. I can reassure him. He has tabled amendment No. 158 and we shall come to that before long. We will debate the grounds in detail when we come to the schedule. There are 11 mandatory and six discretionary grounds in the Bill. Under the former Act there were 21 grounds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister keeps saying that the present legislation has more grounds for possession by the landlord than the new assured tenancy legislation will have. Are not the grounds under the new assured tenancy new grounds, which significantly weaken the position of tenants? I refer particularly to ground 11, one of the mandatory grounds for possession. That is where
	<br><blockquote><p>"the tenant has persistently delayed paying rent"</p></blockquote>
rather than failing, or refusing to pay rent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think it would assist the Committee if we considered that ground, and all the other grounds, in detail when we come to them.

	<div class='title'>FIXING OF TERMS OF STATUTORY ASSURED TENANCY</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 306, in page 11, line 5, leave out first 'may' and insert 'shall'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 308, in page 11, line 5, leave out second 'may' and insert 'shall'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We can deal with these amendments fairly quickly, they are typical Committee amendments in that they propose that we should leave out "may" and insert "shall" in clause 17(2). Under the amendment, within a year of the termination of an assured tenancy, either the landlord or the tenant would be obliged to serve notice of the terms for the statutory assured tenancy that would automatically arise under such circumstances. That might be more satisfactory than the variation on the theme of tacit relocation. It would provide a clear understanding of the future terms of a tenancy which could, if necessary, be referred to a rent assessment committee in the event of disagreement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think there should be any obligation on a landlord or tenant to do that, because we do not want to force them to do things against their will. When I first looked at the amendment I was somewhat baffled by it. I thought it was designed to elicit some explanation of clause 17(2), or to ensure that the landlord could not change the conditions without the agreement of the rent assessment committee. If that was the doubt in the mind of the honourable Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) I assure him that the amendment is not necessary, because already the rent assessment committee must confirm any change of conditions that is not accepted by both landlord and tenant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 17 is easily explained. If the original lease which set up the assured tenancy has been brought to an end, a statutory assured tenancy arises in its place, but an important difference between a statutory assured tenancy and a contractual one is that a statutory assured tenancy will go on indefinitely unless grounds for repossession arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The terms and conditions—I emphasise that the clause is not about rent—which were reasonable in a contractual lease may not be so in a statutory tenancy. For example, if either party wishes to change the arrangements about repairing obligations, clause 17 allows either the tenant or the landlord to propose a change in the lease's conditions and, if both are not agreed, for the other to refer the proposed change to the rent assessement committee which may determine whether the proposed changes are reasonable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>618</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am slightly worried about the terms of subsection 	<i>3(b),</i> which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"if the notice is not so referred … within the month".</p></blockquote>
Let us take the case that my honourable Friend the Minister suggested of someone who is working in Saudi Arabia. He may not receive the notice within a month. For it to be effective—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are not discussing the clause in its entirety, but the proposed amendments. The honourable and learned Member should question that at a later stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I look forward to responding to my honourable and learned Friend's point at a later stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a landlord or tenant wished to have a change in repairing obligations, it would affect the rent. For example, if the tenant said that he wanted the landlord to do more of the repairs, that might affect the rent upwards. If the tenant were to do more of the repairs, he would be entitled to ask for a lower rent. These are legitimate matters to take to the rent assessment committee. These amendments, as drated, would have the effect of requiring either the tenant or the landlord to serve a notice proposing changes in the lease conditions even if they are both perfectly happy with things as they are. Therefore, they are not appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn) will have the opportunity to express his concern in the debate on amendments Nos. 253 and 254. I remain a little anxious about the way in which these tenancies are likely to operate. There could be uncertainty especially where a tenancy is allowed to wander on into the limbo of a statutory assured tenancy, for which no specific terms are written down. A landlord could have even more power than he has under the rest of the legislation to impose new terms or higher rents, or to seek possession of the property. It is an unsatisfactory concept. Nevertheless, I understand the points made by the Minister and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendments Nos. 305, 307 and 336 are for the honourable Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) to move in due course if he wishes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This group of Government amendments is important to ensure fairness for both landlords and tenants. Clause 17 allows a landlord or tenant to propose changes to the terms of a tenancy in certain circumstances. Normally, the terms are arranged and agreed at the beginning of a tenancy and will naturally apply until the tenancy is terminated. Clause 16 means that unless the landlord can gain possession of the house on one of the limited grounds in schedule 5, an assured tenancy will continue after termination as a statutory assured tenancy on the same terms as the original contractual tenancy. Neither the landlord nor the tenant can be expected to foresee all the circumstances which might prevail on such a continuation of the tenancy, so clause 17 gives them both the right to propose changes to the terms to take account of the new circumstances. We have several different possible changes in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the original contract might have allowed a tenant to assign the tenancy if he wished, but given the indefinite length of a statutory assured tenancy, the landlord might think that no longer appropriate. A second example might be the responsibility, as I mentioned on the last group of amendments, for certain repairs. Either the landlord or the tenant may wish to propose a different distribution of responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The aim of the amendments is to allow the rent to be adjusted to reflect any change in the terms of the tenancy. It seems fair that, if there were such changes, the rent should be changed, either upwards or downwards depending on the circumstances. For example, if the tenant took more responsibility for repairs or lost a right to assign, that would be a case for reducing the rent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The eight amendments in the group all make that possible. Amendments Nos. 167 and 168 allow the landlord or tenant to propose an appropriate change in rent to reflect any suggested change in the terms of the tenancy. Amendment No. 169 provides that the change in the rent will apply along with the change in the other terms if no appeal is made to the rent assessment committee. Amendment No. 170 allows the rent assessment committee to determine a change in the rent to reflect a change in other terms, even if no change in the rent was proposed in the first place. That is important to protect tenants, for example, where the landlord proposes that the tenant should be responsible for more repairs but does not propose a parallel reduction in the rent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 171 and 172 amend subsection (5) to ensure that the fact that there is a sitting tenant does not affect the determination of any change in the rent under the clause. Amendments Nos. 173 and 174 enable the rent assessment committee to set a date when the change in the rent will come into effect. However, any change in the rent cannot be back-dated to a time before the date when any
	<span class='label label-info column'>620</span>
proposed change was referred to the rent assessment committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall listen to what the honourable Member for East Lothian says about his amendments before I give him any guidance on their practical application and interpretation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will be interesting to see whether the Minister simply reads from the brief already in his hand after he hears what I say or whether he will vary it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's amendments provide for a variation in rent levels to take account of different circumstances in the tenancy. We can see the case for that, although it is important that the rent assessment committee should have the power to review and some control over such variations. There must be some anxiety that landlords will from time to time try it on by using a minor alteration to the condition of a property as a pretext for shoving up the rent. It is important that something should be done about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments in my name and the names of my honourable Friends introduce the important distinction which the Government seem to fail to recognise between the market rent, which they are aiming at to attract more private landlords on to the scene, and the affordable rent. I know that in another room where English colleagues are discussing the English housing legislation there has been much reference to this term "affordable rent".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 336 would require the rent assessment committee to take account of both relevant aspects of the market level of rent for the property in question by considering not only the willingness of the landlord to let but also the willingness of the prospective tenant. In a sellers' market—that is what we are likely to have in Scotland for the foreseeable future because of the tragic backlog of people stuck on housing waiting lists and becoming homeless—prospective tenants may find themselves compelled to offer rents which would not normally be thought reasonable for the type of property, and which they would not be willing to pay were it not that the only alternative would be homelessness for themselves or their families. We believe that that factor should be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 305 and 307 would make the rent assessment committee's determination of the rent absolutely binding except in cases where a tenant appeals against it, and we suggest in cases where a tenant appeals it, and we suggest that the landlord should have no power to appeal against the rent assessment committee's determination. It was he, after all, who agreed the original rent with the tenant. The tenant has no choice but to abide by that rent and by that stage he will have been paying it for some time. Why should a landlord be able to suggest a still more profitable arrangement for himself at that stage of the tenancy? That seems to be loading the dice far too much in favour of the landlord. I thinkg that we are entitled to ask for such safeguards in order to take account of the circumstances of the tenant, which might otherwise be ignored.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0419">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>621</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to respond. Obviously it is necessary that the rent assessment committee is involved, and it is right that either party should be able to apply to it, especially when there are changing circumstances, and circumstances do change. There is the obvious example of a person who starts off unmarried, then as a family, and his needs and obligations change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 305 and 307 remove some effective rights of tenants which are in the Bill. Amendment No. 305 would remove from the scope of the matters that the rent assessment committee could consider, the question of when the new statutory tenancy began which, obviously can be a relevant factor for the tenant. It would also mean that the rent assessment committee could not take a comprehensive view of all the conditions of the tenancy together. Instead, it would require the committee to consider only the requirements of the tenant and his dependents, and the tenant's ability to pay. That last requirement reflects the misconception that clause 17 is about fixing rents. It is unfair that only the tenant's and not the landlord's requirements should be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 307 continues on the same course. No matter how reasonable the conditions are and what justification there is in equity for them, the rent assessment committee is not to be allowed to agree to them if they would cause the tenant hardship. There is no mention of the possibility that conditions might cause the landlord hardship. To give an example of a landlord being caused hardship, he might have been working for many years overseas, come back and be homeless except for the house of which he had hoped to regain possession. There may not be many such cases but it is certainly possible. The amendment would leave the landlord in an even more exposed position than under the provisions of the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In short, these amendments would guarantee a continuation of the present intolerable situation whereby the scales are so heavily weighted against the landlord that few people are willing to become landlords. The only consequence is that people cannot find the rented accommodation for which they are so desperately looking, which is what my honourable Friend for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) and my honourable and learned Friend the Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn) were saying earlier. It is simply unrealistic to give tenants so many rights that no landlord could ever be found who would enter into such a lease.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 336, although it continues in the same mistaken view, has the additional feature that in the context of the clause it is meaningless. If clause 17 (4) applies, the tenant will already have a statutory assured tenancy, which gives him a right to occupy the house for as long as none of the grounds for possession is satisfied. If the tenant wants to leave, all he has to do is get up and go. He is therefore, in those circumstances, bound to be a willing tenant and the words that are proposed would have no effect. I think that the honourable Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) wishes to intervene.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>622</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that my honourable Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) has been goaded by the Minister. I am afraid that there is unlikely to be a meeting of minds on this subject. I am moved close to tears by the picture which the Minister paints—of landlords in tragic circumstances who will become homeless. When we come to the grounds for possession, we shall acknowledge that there is a case for possession in such circumstances, but we are not talking about that; we are talking about the terms of the tenancy, rent levels and the rest of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am afraid that we shall have to agree to differ from the Government on this subject. We believe that they are loading the dice far too heavily in favour of the landlord and that there are no grounds for their optimism that the private sector, after being moribund for half a century, will suddenly respond in the way that they suggest and start providing high quality, low cost homes for rent for thousands of homeless people in Scotland. The Minister is living in cloud-cuckoo-land if he is suggesting that that will ever come about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is setting up a framework of legislation which will make it far too easy for landlords to exploit tenants and in which, under the clause as drafted, will not enable rent assessment committees to take sufficient account of the circumstances and needs of individual tenants. Cases of extreme hardship could arise where the rent assessment committee will still be required, under the Governments' formula, to impose harsher terms on the tenant. That is not tolerable, so I shall recommend my honourable Friends to vote on this principle when the opportunity arises.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must answer the honourable Gentleman on one point. The Bill gives the tenant strengthened rights against harassment and unlawful eviction and makes certain that there will be a new right to compensation. There are additional rights. When there is a change of circumstances, it is only fair that the rent assessment committee should be involved in the ways suggested in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand what the Minister is saying about his own amendments, but I intend to stick to my guns and I give notice that in due course I and my honourable Friends will register our strong feelings on this point by voting on amendment No. 305.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall not get far into this amendment, but we can make a start.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 253 has been suggested by Shelter Scotland. It allows both the landlord and the tenant further time to consider the implications of proposed changes in the terms of a statutory assured tenancy and thereafter to refer the change to the rent assessment committee. This is the point to which the honourable and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn) referred a minute or two ago. It would increase the period from one month to three months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The wording of subsection (3) means that where a landlord or a tenant fails to refer a notice proposing the terms of a statutory assured tenancy to the rent assessment committee within one month, the proposed changes
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall become terms of the tenancy in substitution for any other terms dealing with the same subject matter."</p></blockquote>
The only proviso is that the notice may specify the date on which the new term or terms come into effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>624</span>
It would not seem unreasonable to allow longer than one month for either party to refer a case to the rent assessment committee, as there could be many reasons for a failure to do so including illness or holiday. The amendment would allow three months within which to approach the rent assessment committee, which appears to give greater safeguards to the landlord and the tenant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the clause is worded, the rent assessment committee has no discretion to accept a late application. If it is considered that the amendment gives too long a fixed period, consideration should be given to allowing the rent assessment committee at least to exercise discretion about accepting accept late applications—for example, later than one month but not later than three months after service of notice—as long as the applicant could show good cause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
