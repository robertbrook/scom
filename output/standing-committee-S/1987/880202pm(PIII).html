	<p>[Continuation from c. 342]</p>
	<p>1.20 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Lambie. As you know, Thames Television has programmes that run through the night. At 3 o'clock this morning there is a programme that will interest the honourable Member for Stirling. It is a film called "Operation Heartbeat", a medical drama from 1969, starring Edward G. Robinson. Has the Government Whip told you whether he will seek to adjourn the Committee to allow the Minister responsible for health to get home to watch that medical drama?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman knows that that is not a point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to waste any more of the Committee's time on amendment No. 73. There are seven other amendments that I have not yet touched on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to ensure that under schedule 1 we have a board that is representative of housing in Scotland and of all the other co-ordinating bodies and services that affect Scottish housing. That is the aim of the amendments. It is especially important to ensure that the Secretary of State does not restrict the board to nine members appointed by him. It would be better to have an arbitrary selection of nine people than to rely on the method that the Secretary of State has adopted to date. With a limit of 15, there is less chance of the Secretary of State finding 15 Conservative clones. That is the main drive behind amendment No. 74.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the limit remains nine, the board of Scottish Homes will have no credibility in Scotland. The national housing agency will be subject to widespread ridicule and will have no chance of remedying serious housing problems. That is why we seek an increase to a number that people will feel to be credible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that a board of nine—or, indeed, seven—had been shown to be representative, but it has been clearly demonstrated that those people were not representative. Neither the public nor their elected representatives have had confidence in them. It has taken the personal intervention of elected councillors or Members of Parliament to shift them. The most that even a Member of Parliament seems to
	<span class='label label-info column'>344</span>
have achieved is a minor playground or play scheme in his constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want more than that. We wish to ensure that the tenants have direct representation and the right to influence their rents, which the Government have attacked in council housing and housing associations. We read yesterday of the increase in the rents by the Scottish Special Housing Association without any consultation with tenants. That must end. We need to see tenants being more involved in the management policies that affect their houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, this is a direction in which some councils are moving, and some councils have adopted local management committees and are to be commended for that. But Scottish Homes gives no say to those tenants, no encouragement, no responsibility—a favourite word of the Government—and by failing to guarantee even one tenants' representative on Scottish Homes, the Government are denying the tenants the chance to act in a responsible, representative manner about their own housing. We have heard about severe problems of dampness. A tenant member appointed to the board would be the person to draw attention to those severe problems, because he himself might live in a damp house and be ideally placed to present a tenant's point of view to the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equally, unless we guarantee a member of the housing profession on the board—perhaps someone nominated by the Institute of Housing—who can speak for those officers in local authority housing departments who have a great deal of experience, there is no guarantee that the mistakes of the present will not be repeated and the mistakes of the past will not be dug up again, to be inflicted on all the tenants of the housing associations for which Scottish Homes will be responsible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are two groups of people who should, we believe, by statute be represented on the board of Scottish Homes: the tenants themselves, who are the consumers of the service, working in partnership with the managers of the service, who should be almost the employees of the tenants. The managers could thus give from their expert advice and experience concrete data on the problems of management and the scale of the problems in Scottish Homes and say whether there was a need for a house condition survey. I have no doubt that both managers and tenants would unit in calling for such a survey and for proper resources to be made available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps in that we reach the nub of the problem. The Government are not willing to give either the tenants or representatives of the housing professions a direct say in Scottish Homes in case they raise such embarrassing issues. They are the sorts of embarrassing issues that are paralleled on the health boards, the Government's policy towards which has been much maligned in the past few hours and days. Health boards are unaware of the problems that their local areas suffer beyond the positive plus and minus balance sheets—that is the accountant mentality that the Minister responsible for health and the Government have inflicted on the health boards. We want to avoid that with Scottish Homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0269">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>345</span>
We want to make sure that people are put on to the Scottish Homes board who represent the tenants and who work in the housing service, to make sure that the money available is spent wisely. If cuts have to come—and the Government have plenty of experience in cutting housing budgets—they must not cut almost at random and close at random, as has happened with health boards, but plan for progress in the future and, if necessary, stand independently against the Government to make sure that they are made aware of the shortcomings of their policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government seek to avoid that, apparently at all costs. I commend the amendments because within them we have the twin benefits of representation of the people who will be most affected by the decisions that Scottish Homes takes, and the secondary benefit of making sure that resources are well used within an independent framework and not subject to Government whims or bias and not subject to the accusations, true or untrue, of people being just "place men" on the body. Let us have elections to the board, a greater representation and more members, thereby avoiding all the pitfalls that I have described.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I realise that this is a very early hour—half past one—and that members of the Committee are tired, so I shall try to be brief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>1.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are not in the least tired.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry. Members of the Committee are not tired. They are looking forward to the movies on Thames Television later this morning perhaps. I shall try to be as brief as possible and keep my remarks to the point and not be tempted into the debate over the Catholic or Masonic origins of the putative members of the Scottish Homes board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 73 deals with members of Scottish Homes having their only or major residence in Scotland. The honourable and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn) accused the amendment of being parochial. That is an accusation that all Opposition Members refute. He tried to argue his case of parochialism on the basis of what turned out to be a twin act, a duel between himself and the honourable Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) as they regaled the Committee with tales of the British Empire and of the Raj, and of how the Scots left Scotland to run the British Empire in the 19th century. That was indeed the case, but what both honourable Gentlemen failed to recognise was that the reason the Scots were leaving Scotland to run the British Empire was that there were so few opportunities available to them in Scotland because at that time Scotland's affairs were run directly and in great detail from Westminster.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The experience of the Scots who were forced to leave Scotland and run the British Empire all the more underlines the case for a Scottish Assembly. If that had been conceded by the Government in accordance with the demands of the Scottish people, much of the debate tonight would have been
	<span class='label label-info column'>346</span>
redundant because housing would have been under the control of a Scottish Assembly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman demonstrates that he is one of the people who have not been in Scotland very long because he does not know anything about Scottish history. The first time that the Scottish soldier was recognised was when the Sinclairs went to save King Gustavus Adolphus in what is now Norway but was then Sweden. I am glad to say that I marched to his grave and laid a wreath thereon in his honour. The Mackay highlanders, otherwise known as the Reay fencibles, who were founded in 1542 in Holland, are another example of the fact that the Scots were early Europeans. That was long before the British Empire, long before the Union and long before Westminster, so what on earth does the honourable Gentleman think he is talking about?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am quite interested in Scottish history, but not at half past one in the morning. Again, I ask honourable Members to keep to the amendments being discussed. I know that it is sometimes useful to throw in an illustration to make a point, but do not let us deal with illustrations and forget the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept your point entirely, Mr. Lambie, and I certainly shall not be tempted to go down the road of responding to Gustavus Adolphus, especially since that gentleman was involved in the 30 years' war, which was a war between Protestants and Catholics, and I do not want to open that question again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable and learned Gentleman referred to my own lack of Scottishness and my recent origin, as my family no doubt came from Northern Ireland and settled in Scotland. What he fails to recognise is that my grandfather fought with the Scottish Rifles in Gallipoli and was mortally wounded, and I resent any imputation against my own family's or my commitment to my country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall take your advice, Mr. Lambie, and return to the purpose of the amendments before us, especially to amendment No. 73, which deals with members of the Scottish Homes board having their main residence in Scotland. The justification for the amendment is that a body such as Scottish Homes has a wide remit and powers over Scottish housing, and it is only sensible that its members should understand its distinctive features and problems, and also the issues and problems which the new agency will deal with. That will be difficult if they do not live in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is common sense that anyone who agrees to come on to the board of Scottish Homes will also agree to have his main residence in Scotland. The board is not only to deal with Scottish housing problems, but must experience them at first hand. For example, in earlier sittings it has been remarked that a distinctive feature of Scottish housing is the extent of overcrowding. There are 1.25 million Scots living in overcrowded accommodation. That does not happen in England and Wales. Conditions such as exist in Scotland today have not existed in England
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0270">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>347</span>
and Wales for the past 20 or 30 years. Any member of the Scottish Homes board who has his or her main residence in England or Wales will not be able to grasp the significance of the overcrowding problem in Scotland. Similarly, the predominance of the public rented sector, which is a feature of the Scottish housing scene, is different from the situation in England and Wales or elsewhere. How can members of the board of Scottish Homes who do not appreciate that difference come to terms with the problems which the new agency will have to address?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My honourable Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) discussed the important issue of the pattern which has begun to be established in Scotland of control over distinctly Scottish affairs being moved out of our country and south of the border. He referred to Britoil and the likely takeover by British Petroleum, which will not be stopped by the Government. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has made it clear that he is prepared to sit back and watch control over a Scottish-based company slip out of Scotland. In all likelihood, the base of operations of Britoil will slip out as well, as happened under the Distillers takeover, when the headquarters moved southwards. The Scottish Transport Group and the electricity industry are under similar threat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we go ahead with the provisions of the Bill, which would allow the nine members of the Scottish Homes board to come from outwith Scotland, it will conform to a pattern which every member of the Committee should be aware of and should be alarmed and prepared to do something about. What they could do is agree to the amendment saying that members of the Scottish Homes board should have their main residence in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments also argue for a wider membership of the board, in particular, to go beyond the provision for a minimum of nine members on the new board. There is justification for that provision in that, since Scottish Homes will have wide powers over housing affairs in Scotland, it is important that the members should not be restricted to nine, as that might well limit their potential to respond to the challenge of tackling Scottish housing problems, as well as limiting the diversity of interests represented on the board of the new agency. Furthermore, it would be unfortunate if, by failing to provide for a minimum membership, such a large and influential organisation were controlled by what might be unrepresentative and inexperienced members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Above all, it is important that we do not simply leave the membership of Scottish boards in the hands of the Secretary of State for Scotland, who will appoint all nine members as he sees fit. As we have seen from the experience of health boards in Scotland, that power should not be left in the hands of the Secretary of State. It is tragic that, in the present crisis over the Health Service in Scotland, all but one of the chairmen of the health boards in Scotland are sympathetic to the Conservative party, and therefore antipathetic to the cause which the majority of Scots support, which goes against the Government's policy, funding the Health Service from general taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>348</span>
We have debated the number of people who should serve on the Scottish Homes board. The Minister said that the SSHA board has between five and seven members. The honourable Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro), who is now absent, said the board of ICI has nine members, and was a good model upon which to base the Scottish Homes board. The honourable Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) said that the Housing Corporation board has 15 members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier this evening the Minister argued vehemently that, as a matter of precedence, Scottish Homes should imitate the operation of the Housing Corporation and the SSHA. If it is a matter of precedence in some instances, why not in others? If it is right to have 15 members on the Housing Corporation board, why is it not right to have 15 on the Scottish Homes board?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The membership of the Housing Corporation board, as outlined in its report for 1986–87, is rather sad. It certainly has 15 members, but only one is a woman and there are no tenant representatives. There is little evidence that housing professionals have any say on that board. Its membership list includes a former Lord Mayor of Westminster—perhaps the predecessor of the honourable Member for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Arbuthnot); a former civil servant; the vice-chairman of the Salisbury city almshouse and welfare charities; and the vice-chairman of the Chichester diocesan housing association—a body that clearly has a direct interest, and should be represented, but it is the first with any experience of housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also a lecturer in private law at Glasgow university; the deputy chairman of English China Clays; the manager of the Nationwide Building Society in Wales; and a senior consultant to a firm of architects—at least he has some connection with housing. Finally there is a company director; a barrister-at-law; a director and general manager of the Heart of England building society; the Bishop of Croydon; and the chief executive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The basis for the appointment of those members should be explained to the Committee. Why were they brought on to the board of the Housing Corporation? On what basis will the nine—we hope the 15—members of the Scottish Homes board be chosen? The Minister must explain how he will try to ensure that the board's membership reflects the variety of interests in Scottish housing that will be affected by the new agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certain groups deserve to be represented.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the honourable Gentleman speak up a little? I am having difficulty hearing, and he is sending his honourable Friend the Member for Glasgow, Hillhead to sleep.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find great difficulty speaking at this hour of the morning, so the honourable Gentleman must bear with me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One group that deserves to be represented—and we ask the Minister to concede that tonight—are the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0271">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>349</span>
tenants. The Government have long maintained that they want to provide increasing tenant involvement in housing in Scotland. If they are serious, they must involve tenants at every level, not just at the local level of housing co-operatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government also claim to be determined to encourage the development of housing associations. Again, if they are serious they must ensure that the housing assocations are represented on the board. There is no way around that. Our amendments specifically ask for housing associations and tenants to be represented on the new board, and the Minister must accept and concede that they have that right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must not forget COSLA. As the Minister has repeatedly told us, COSLA will be directly affected by the work of the new housing agency. For example, we are told that as well as taking over the 83,000 homes from the SSHA, Scottish Homes will also be in the business of taking homes and houses away from district councils. District councils will therefore be directly affected by the activities of Scottish Homes, and it is important that COSLA, the district councils' representative body in Scotland, has a say in how the new agency will go about those activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
1.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unless COSLA and the district councils are brought together with Scottish Homes in a spirit of co-operation, the three parties are likely to be in direct conflict, which will be to no one's benefit, especially not the tenants who will be affected by such competition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister replies, he will have to concede that COSLA, the tenants and the housing associations have a right to be represented on the board of Scottish Homes. If the Minister concedes that point, I argue that he must also concede that nine members are unsufficient and that he will have to widen the membership to allow the sufficient organisations to be represented on the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments go further. They ask that whoever is appointed to the board should show some expertise not only in housing but in Scottish housing. For example, we are told that the honourable Member for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Arbuthnot) was invited to serve on the Committee because of his particular expertise in housing. He was the vice-chairman of the housing committee of Kensington and Chelsea district council, yet he has sat silent. He is not even here. Is he asleep next door? Whatever he is doing, he will be making the same contribution that he has made whenever he has sat on the Conservative Benches—that is, absolutely none. We do not want people such as the honourable Gentleman appointed to the Scottish Homes board, even if they have a background of housing expertise. We want people with a background of expertise in Scottish housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scottish housing is distinct from that in England and Wales and I have already shown how overcrowding and homelessness in Scotland are very different. The system of public sector housing finance is also very different, so members of the Scottish
	<span class='label label-info column'>350</span>
Homes board will have to know how district councils run housing revenue accounts and understand the capital allocation system, between the housing revenue account A block and the housing revenue account B block. Members will have to understand the work of housing associations in Scotland and, for example, the distinctive contributions made by the Bield housing association or, indeed, by the Servite or Cleghorn housing association. Members will have to know the difference between those types of housing associations and the SSHA.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One difficulty of someone based outside Scotland in understanding the Scottish housing scene would be getting accustomed to the absurdity of trying to work in a nation where there was no national house condition survey. I suspect that people from other parts of the United Kingdom would find that omission difficult to understand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My honourable Friend makes a fair point. It is accepted in England and Wales that there should be a national house condition survey and that the Government should have some understanding of the extent of problems such as dampness and condensation in the housing stock. Those requirements are not accepted in Scotland, which is an important distinction. Members of the Scottish Homes board will have to recognise the difference and respond to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman is making a detailed and interesting case about how the members of the board should be chosen and selected for their backgrounds and expertise. Will he advise the Committeee whether he is advancing the same selection methods and procedures that were used to appoint the people who run the Labour clubs in Dundee? If so, is their financial expertise the kind that he is advocating for Scottish Homes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is going wide of the amendment for this time of the morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept your decision, Mr. Lambie. The question was not only wide of the mark but below the belt, and the honourable Gentleman knows it. It does not become him to make such interventions out of character.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, it is totally in character.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry. It is in character. A person smiles and calls one his friend at the same time as he quietly puts the boot in, as they say in my area.

There is a real need for people appointed to the board of Scottish Homes to understand the context of Scottish housing, and I am not convinced that that is part of the Government's plan. I feel that the Government's long-term plan for Scottish Homes is its privatisation and that of the homes under its control. On that basis, the Government will make their appointments on the ground that appointees are likely to favour such a development rather than take people who have a genuine interest in tackling the real problems of Scottish housing.

	<span class='label label-info column'>351</span>
There is more to this than expertise. There is also whether there should be a geographical spread in the membership of Scottish Homes. This is not only a matter for urban and rural differences, although this distinction is important. There would be great concern if Scottish Homes concerned itself exclusively with the problems of major cities of Scotland and forgot the genuine problems of Scottish rural areas. I say that with some feeling, having for a time been the convenor of Tayside regional council and having been made aware that there are real housing problems in such places as Aberfeldy and Blairgowrie and other areas near my constituency. Such problems need attention, and it is important that the board of Scottish Homes contains people who understand the problems of both rural and urban housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's earlier remarks disturbed me when we debated capital allocations to Aberdeen. He said, "Ah, but the problems in Glasgow are much worse, and it is a matter of priorities." I accept that Glasgow's problems are much worse and that it is a question of priorities. But the tone of the honourable Gentleman's remarks was such as to indicate a danger that Scottish Homes might become exclusively concerned with the major problems in such areas as Glasgow and the west coast urban spread while forgetting the north coast in particular. Therefore it is important to have on the board a geographical spread not only from Strathclyde but from the east and north-east and the Highlands. It is essential that these be represented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 108 refers to some who is
	<br><blockquote><p>"otherwise unable or unfit to discharge the functions of a member, or is unsuitable to continue as a member."</p></blockquote>
We discussed whether to use the word "unsuitable", and the name of Mr. Ted Matthews was mentioned. I recall my experience of Tory administrations and how they are likely to use such a word. I go back to my days as a member of the opposition on Tayside regional council's social work Committee. There was a Tory proposal to open a unit within my ward, Trottick Gilburn. Dundee administration proposed taking over a children's home in my area and using it for adolescents coming from list D schools and out of care and having to make their way in the world. There was much resistance locally to the idea not so much because people objected to the unit—which I supported—because they felt it should have been set up in a place that did not complicate matters for these adolescents, as the area chosen was known for groups and gangs of young people, anyway. They showed signs of glue sniffing and vandalism, and it was felt that the area was wrong. I organised the meeting of local residents who gave the social work convenor—a Tory—quite a mauling when he spoke to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consequence was that the convenor moved a motion to exclude me from the board of directors of one of the children's homes in Dundee as a person unsuitable for the post. The basis of my unsuitability was that I had arranged the meeting at which he was given a mauling by local residents. That shows the lengths of pettiness to which Tory administrations will go. It was a terrible indictment of that man.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>352</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentlemen makes an important and interesting point about whether a person is acceptable or suitable. He said that the decision was taken that an intermediate treatment centre would be located in his ward. He will be aware that a similar project was proposed within the Rosemount area of Blairgowrie, and local knowledge again pointed out that that was not the place to put it, again for equally valid reasons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My point is that the word "unsuitable" should not be in the Bill. The amendment suggests the word "ineligible", which would be far more accurate and would meet everyone's wishes. The honourable and learned Member for Perth and Kinross made valid points. Some people would not be fit to hold places on the Scottish Homes board—not on the basis of unsuitability, but rather of ineligibility, based on specific criteria that laid down the reason for their ineligibility. The honourable and learned Gentlemen mentioned corruption, insanity and other examples. That could be fixed as an appendix and the criteria could be clearly spelt out. Anyone not conforming would be ineligible for membership. That would be far more satisfactory, because the word "unsuitable" would allow the Secretary of State to decide on political—even on personal—grounds that someone whom he did not like or thought unsuitable should be excluded from the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be a dangerous precedent to give any Secretary of State for Scotland that sort of power especially the present one, who is not here today and who has shown himself prepared to renege on his word many times if his own office is at stake and do the bidding of the Prime Minister. Although it would mean going against his personal inclinations he might be forced to make personal and political decisions. That would be utterly contemptible and retrograde, and would be rejected by the Scottish people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate has lasted for several hours and it should be brought to an end by the Minister answering clearly the questions raised by all seven Opposition speakers. He should go through them in a detailed manner, giving full and comprehensive explanations of the way the Government think we should go forward. If he fails to do that, the only interpretation that can be made is that he has gone into his hole and is not coming out because he has no answers and he is going ahead in a prejudiced and party-political manner which, in the long run, can only undermine any potential chance for Scottish Homes to be successful in Scotland and make a go of tackling the housing crisis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At long last I have the opportunity to say a few words. The membership of the board of Scottish Homes is extemely important. The honourable Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) asked me according to what criteria persons would be chosen. The answer is simple—on merit. The White Paper, paragraph 2.17 states:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0273">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>353</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government intend that Board members should be chosen for their potential personal contribution to the success of Scottish Homes. It will be appropriate to seek a variety of background experiences."</p></blockquote>
Our expectations of the new body can be realised only with committed and capable people working together as a team. We intend to appoint such a group drawn from a broad range of background experience in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) mentioned indirect election. The Government's view, expressed in the Whiter Paper, was
	<br><blockquote><p>"that it would inhibit the effectiveness of Scottish Homes and it is undesirable in principle to have a large board constructed on the basis of direct representation of various interests."</p></blockquote>
The members of Scottish Homes should be chosen for their personal qualities and experience, not as protagonists of particular sectional interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 73 would require members to have their only or main residence in Scotland. I have no doubt that the majority of those appointed will be Scottish, by both domicile and birth: there are many Scots well able to make a full contribution. However, I sympathise with the remarks made by the honourable Member for Tayside, North and my honourable and learned Friend the Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that we should be so parochial as to rule out of membership someone with indisputable knowledge of Scotland who may be living elsewhere, for employment or other reasons. However, without question the headquarters of Scottish Homes should be in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>2.00 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do we have a specific assurance that the headquarters of Scottish Homes will be in Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A Distillers assurance, is it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps. We accept, at this stage, that someone living outside Scotland might be a suitable candidate for nomination to the board of Scottish Homes, but will the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland accept that the affect of the amendment would be to require someone who is to be a member of the board of Scottish Homes to transfer his home to the area for which he will be responsible?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I give an example? The vice-chairman of the Housing Corporation is based in Scotland. The Scottish committee of the Housing Corporation, which is not a statutory body, consists of four members, and the chairman and the chief executive are domiciled in Scotland. The vice-chairman, whose work is mainly south of the border, has transferred his home to Scotland, as I said earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked why the Housing Corporation should have 15 members on its board when the proposal for
	<span class='label label-info column'>354</span>
Scottish Homes was a board of nine members, plus the chief executive. The difference is that the Housing Corporation has to cater for the specialised housing needs of 50 million persons, whereas Scottish Homes will relate to only 5 million persons. Therefore, the scale of operation will relate to fewer people on a population basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The number of the members of the board is, of course, not fixed by paragraph 4 of the schedule, nor would it be by amendment No. 74 or amendment No. 96. We believe 10 individuals, including the chief executive, to be the most we need to achieve our purpose. If the maximum were changed to 15 members, I doubt that the Government would wish to appoint that number. It is important to avoid too cumbersome a board, which is not well suited to providing clear guidance to the organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper also recognised the need for the board to include
	<br><blockquote><p>"someone able to contribute experience of the interests of tenants".</p></blockquote>
I do not need to say more than that because it is our intention to make such an appointment. Incidentally, I should mention that the Housing Corporation was criticised by one honourable Member for not appointing a tenant to the board. The Housing Corporation has no tenants and therefore honourable Members should be fair in that connection—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> It is true. The Housing Corporation does not have tenants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Parliamentary Under-Secretary said that the interests of tenants would be represented. Does that mean that it is the Government's stated intention to appoint a tenant, or simply someone who will look after their interests without actually being a tenant?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The phrase in the White Paper is
	<br><blockquote><p>"someone able to contribute experience of the interests of tenants".</p></blockquote>
It is our intention to make such an appointment, without the need for amendment No. 76 to require us to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 107 is another amendment which, in its basic objective, is in line with our intentions and does not require statutory provision. We certainly have no intention of appointing board members without an interest in improving Scotland's housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult to understand why anyone who was not interested in that would be interested in appointment. In addition, although Opposition Members tend to dismiss points about drafting, I caution against the clear implication in the amendment that every board member should have a technical background in housing. We wish to have a board with a wide range of experience relevant to housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to amendments Nos. 32 and 60, I see no merit in providing specially for geographical or other representation. I do not believe that there is so little consensus on the way forward in improving
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0274">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>355</span>
Scotland's housing that we need each area or interest to be separately represented. The interest of each part of Scotland will not be ignored; the decentralised structure will ensure that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Neither is it conceivable that Scottish Homes will seek to work in conflict with housing associations, as it is specifically charged with responsibility for their promotion and development. I suggest that amendments Nos. 32 and 60 are unnecessary and potentially damaging to Scottish Homes. This is a matter of general principle. Individuals who are nominally considered to represent a given area or interest are no substitute for a proper concern for consultation with the full range of those who share that interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for East Lothian raised the question of the expression "unsuitable for membership". The phrasing of subparagraph 5(3)(d) is identical to the parallel provision in subparagraph 6(d) of schedule 1 to the Scottish Development agency Act 1975, and the provisions relating to the housing corporation. The Bill does not use the word "ineligible", as the matter does not arise in the schedule. "Unsuitable" is very much a term of art in this context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) is not here, I shall respond for the record to his comment. Subject to the principles that I have set out, we believe in the best man or woman for the job. The spirit behind the amendments will be borne in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is unfortunate that the honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire is not here. We all understand that he is feeling poorly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am disappointed as I expected to be by the tone of the Minister's response. He comes across as the hard man of the Scottish Office nowadays. Perhaps that is because the honourabe Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth) is sitting next to him, looking ominous and threatening, and scaring him to death. We have the Minister as the hard man of the Scottish Office, and we have the new macho man from the Whips Office, who will parade around for the next few weeks saying, "Aren't I clever? I kept three Ministers out of their beds all night." That will earn him many Brownie points. That lad could go far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's response was disappointing and predictable. Clearly, the Government's intentions confirm our worst fears about the nature of the quango that they are about to set up. The White Paper contains the soft sell. Paragraph 1.1 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This White Paper sets out the Government's plans for the future framework of housing policy in Scotland. They will:"—</p></blockquote>
among other things—
	<br><blockquote><p>"encourage greater individual responsibility for, and control over, the conditions in which people live".</p></blockquote>
The body that will oversee that will be just another quango, with perhaps fewer than nine people serving on it. There is no guarantee that there will be direct or indirect representation for the different interest groups involved in housing in Scotland, or the different geographical areas of Scotland. The Bill does
	<span class='label label-info column'>356</span>
not require that there should be even a single representative of tenants in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is the Government's intention, it will not stand up in a court of law. If, next year or the year after, Scottish Homes has been or is being constituted—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Lambie. Can you advise me and the Committee whether this is an intervention or a speech? I was trying to follow what my honourable Friend the Minister was saying, and I was not sure whether he would continue his speech, or whether there had been a change in the batting order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister had completed his statement. The honourable Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) said that he wished to speak and he is speaking now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that that has satisfied the honourable Member for Tayside, North. Unfortunately, the Minister had concluded his remarks; it would have been nice if he had been able to tell us more, but it was clear that his brief did not allow him much leeway. He stuck to this brief, as we have come to expect of him in the Committee, and we are not much further forward. I am in the process of explaining why we do not think much of the Minister's reply, and my honourable Friends will make up their own minds, in the light of guidance from my honourable Friend the Member for East Kilbride, on how to vote on the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the honourable Member for Tayside, North made the point of order, I was saying that in the not-too-distant future the Government could nominate people to serve on the board of Scottish Homes, and we may find that there is not one to represent the interests of tenants in Scotland. It will be no good our saying, "But the honourable Member for Edinburgh, West said that there would be someone from Scottish Homes", because the half-undertaking that the Minister gave is not binding. Unless the schedule is amended, the Secretary of State will have absolute discretion to appoint whoever he likes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galloway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The half-commitment is not even half a commitment, because all we have been told is that there will be one person on the board with experience of the interests of tenants. That could mean Mr. Rachman, were he still alive, or one of the kindly lairds, or one of the new kindly landlords. They have plenty experienc of tenants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps my honourable Friend is putting me forward as a potential candidate for the job. I am not interested in taking up the appointment, but it is kind of him to suggest it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's semi-undertaking is not worth the paper on which it will be printed. There is no point in the Scottish tenants' organisation or anyone else going to court and saying, "The Government have not kept the undertaking that they gave in the First Scottish Standing Committee at 10 past two in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0275">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>357</span>
morning on 3 February." What the Minster has said in this Committee is meaningless in terms of the force of law. The Bill says that the Secretary of State shall appoint
	<br><blockquote><p>"not more than 9 persons"</p></blockquote>
to do the job, and there is no requirement to ensure fair representation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may not arise—I hope that it will not, but if it does I am sure that the honourable Gentleman will ask me to defend him—but if the honourable Gentleman was a rich landowner in Berwickshire, which is much nearer to London than it is to Orkney for the purposes of Scottish representations, and was charged with a criminal offence, he would have a board of 15 Scottish jurors representing him. He would not start by saying, "It is important that a white, Catholic, rich, Socialist landowner has a representative on the jury." He would have to take the jury as it was. It is fatuous to suggest that boards, juries and people who run things should in some nominal way be representative of fantasy factions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are rewards in sitting late in Committee—for example, the little tirades from the honourable and learned Member for Perth and Kinross.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the honourable and learned Gentleman suggests that there is a parallel between the random selection of citizens to serve on juries and the selection of people to manage 83,000 houses and more in Scotland, he is on the wrong path. What is required is a board of members who can represent relevant interests in Scotland—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> This is it. The Tory Administration—which has a minority of Members in Scotland—govern Scotland and they regard Scottish tenants as the accused.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>2.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, in Scotland there is a presumption of innocence. But suppose that eight people—including one 80-year-old, one female, one who is black and one who is white—are all accused of different things. We would not suggest that the jury should be representative of their separate interests. We want people of an intelligent capability—whether nine or 15 of them—who can reach a proper judgment on the issues involved. The selection process should not be ridiculously partial.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps we can do a deal with the honourable and learned Gentleman if he insists on pursuing the analogy with juries. However, I do not believe that it is strictly relevant as there is supposed to be a random selection of those on juries. There are fairly crucial distinctions between the role of a jury and that of the board of Scottish Homes. But, as I said, perhaps we can do a deal. If the honourable and learned Gentleman would be happy for the citizens of Scotland to be granted the right of peremptory challenge on any nomination which the Secretary of State for Scotland might propose for membership of the board of Scottish Homes, we might reach a compromise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>358</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We might go further. An amendment could be tabled which proposed the random selection of members for the Scottish Homes board. I, for one, should be much more willing to accept that than the Secretary of State appointing the sort of place men who have done so much damage to Lothian health board and other quangos. Give me a random choice any day, compared with anything which the Government are likely to propose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The trouble with that is who would do the random selecting. I caution my honourable Friend in that respect. If it was the Secretary of State for Scotland, the board of men and women might be slightly different from that which my honourable Friend or I might obtain on a random selection of men in the street, whether Princes Street, Sauchiehall Street, Union Street or anywhere else. I am not sure whether that idea would be good enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But I am attracted by the idea of peremptory challenge. Perhaps the honourable and learned Member for Perth and Kinross will submit a manuscript amendment—in the hypothetical circumstances of your accepting it, Mr. Lambie—to provide for peremptory challenge by any citizen or tenant in Scotland of nominations made by the Secretary of State for Scotland to the board of Scottish Homes. If he did that, we would give it positive consideration. But the honourable and learned Gentleman seems to have gone quiet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The schedule as it stands relates to the membership of the board of Scottish Homes. We have discussed at some length the case for representation for different bodies and interests in Scotland on that board. Amazingly, there is no reference in the Bill to any period of appointment. Technically it would be possible for the Secretary of State for Scotland to nominate two people—perhaps even one person—to carry out all the functions vested in Scottish Homes for life. Nothing could stop him doing that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The individual nominated could, in all the glory of Scottish Homes, spend the budget and carry out all the functions that we have discussed. Nobody could challenge him except the Secretary of State for Scotland. That seems a curious approach. We have already covered the numbers, but in this debate we shall be able to spend a minute or two discussing the case for fixed term appointments. As far as I know, it is normal practice when appointing members to boards or nominated organisations in Scotland or elsewhere—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>2.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There seems to be fairly chaotic Government whipping here. First they do not seem to know how much business they want to transact and now they cannot even maintain a quorum in the Committee. In all the years that I have served on Standing Committees on Scottish legilsation I cannot remember an occasion when the Government have been unable to maintain a quorum. They now seem to have roused several Ministers and other members from their slumbers and others may soon be whisked back into the Committe as the Government Whip tries to maintain a quorum. Now that Conservative Members have got themselves together again perhaps they will concentrate their minds on the extraordinary nature of this part of the Bill. The Secretary of State will be able to nominate people to Scottish Homes either for five minutes or for life.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galloway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I saw an interesting spectacle when I left the Room. A succession of members of the Committee were going into the Room next door.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Is that an intervention of a point of order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galloway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a point of order and I seek your guidance, Mr. Lambie. I simply wondered whether refreshments had been laid on next door or whether the horses or even the elephants were stabled there. A steady stream of Conservative Members has been coming and going, adjusting their dress as they went. I am a little worried about what they are doing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman knows that that is not a point of order. What happens outside the Committee is not the responsibility of the Chairman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to hear that, Mr. Lambie. It sounds fascinating nevertheless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now that the Conservative Members have eagerly returned from whatever they have been doing perhaps they will consider the fact that under the Bill the Secretary of State for Scotland will be able to appoint members to the board of Scottish Homes for an indeterminate period. A person could be appointed to the board of Scottish Homes one day and find himself sacked the next day not for reasons of unsuitability but because the Secretary of State had decided that his term of office was only 24 hours. Similarly, a person could be appointed for five or 10 years or even for life.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galloway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like the president of the National Union of Mineworkers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My honourable Friend referred to the president of the National Union of Mineworkers. The Government have been at pains to legislate to require trade unions to conduct regular ballots for their full-time officials and national officers. Speaking personally, rather than as the spokesman for my party, I believe that there probably
	<span class='label label-info column'>362</span>
is a case for, say, the president of the National Union of Mineworkers being elected on a regular basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have gone to the ends of the earth to legislate to impose such requirements on trade unions and representative bodies, but in this Bill they seek powers to enable the Secretary of State for Scotland to give people long-term, remunerated appointments on the board of Scottish Homes. If a person who had been appointed by the present Secretary of State for 10, 20 or 30 years was then dismissed by his successor under the terms of paragraph (d), that person could claim breach of contract and compensation from the Government. Under the proposals, one Government could bind the hands of their successors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What precedents exist for such open-ended appointments to quangos? In my experience appointments to health boards, the Forestry Commission and many other quangos are on fixed terms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the honourable Gentleman asks about precedents, will he advise members of the Committee, especially those who have been elected only to this Parliament and who have not been involved previously in such legislation, what the statutory nomenclature is. Is it not identical to the Bill? Does not the Secretary of State, when he appoints a person to a government body, invite that person to serve for a certain number of years subject always to the recall of the so-called predatory clauses of inevitability? Will the honourable Gentleman quote to me any Act where the Secretary of State has powers of appointment and where the limited time is stated in the statute? If he cannot do so, he should not raise the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry but I cannot give a specific, detailed answer on the statute. When I was appointed to a health board in Scotland, it was made clear to me that the appointment was for a limited period, which, I think, was three years. I assumed that the statute dealing with the National Health Service in Scotland made that provision. I would have thought it strange if the appointment had been open-ended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not what I asked. I did not aske whether the Secretary of State of whatever Government makes an appointment for a certain period, but whether the honourable Gentleman can quote any statute that nominates a terminal period only to the end of which one can be appointed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Off the cuff, the answer is no, I have invited the Minister to quote precedents and no doubt he will do so. We seek clarification of the Government's intentions on the length of the appointments. The honourable and learned Member for Perth and Kinross suggested that it is normal custom for Parliament to pass legislation enabling Secretaries of State to appoint to serve for as long as they so wished on such quangos. That seems odd, surprising and inappropriate. If no safeguards are provided to prevent appointees from abusing such power, it is about time that we debated the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0278">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>363</span>
Will the Minister explain the position? Failing that, perhaps the honourable Member for Tayside, North can assist us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My honourable and learned Friend the Member for Perth and Kinross asked the honourable Gentleman questions that he could not answer. Perhaps the honourable Gentleman can advise the Committee on those Acts passed by Labour Governments which dealt with the appointment of individuals to quangos which are still operating.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman has simply repeated the point made by his honourable and learned Friend the Member for Perth and Kinross. If it is possible for Secretaries of State to nominate people to boards for unlimited periods, that is a matter of some anxiety and we are entitled to ask the Minister for an explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman asked for precedents. The provisions dealing with the chairman and members of Scottish Homes are virtually identical to those covering the appointment of the chairmen of the SDA and the Housing Corporation and their periods of office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments seek to fix the term of office of the chairman, deputy chairman and members of Scottish Homes at three years, with the opportunity of their re-appointment to the board at that time. The Bill provides that members and office-bearers will hold and vacate office in accordance with the terms of their appointment, thus allowing the Secretary of State flexibility in the length of their appointment if he considers that a shorter or longer term is appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a good reason why such flexibility will be important, especially in the early life of Scottish Homes. The immediate task is to establish a new housing agency to carry out the various functions assigned to it under clause 1, and to enable it to build up important relationships with other housing authorities, housing associations and representatives within the public, private and voluntary sectors. The setting up of such a body will require qualities in its board's membership different from those that might be appropriate in an established agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, some of the earlier appointments might be for a shorter time than we expect to be the standard when Scottish Homes is up and running. In due course, I envisage a standard term of appointment being offered to members, the deputy chairman and the chairman. The amendments would require a complete review of all board members every three years, whereas, under the Bill, after the initial setting-up period, appointment reviews will be staggered. If Opposition Members do not withdraw the amendment, I shall urge the Committee to reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the discussion of the previous amendment, we touched on the fundamental principle of unfettered discretion. It is becoming commonplace that the principal legislation provides
	<span class='label label-info column'>364</span>
the skeleton and the meat is left to regulations. We are talking not about regulation, but about the control of a Minister's patronage. I have no doubt that the powers in the Bill are in line with other measures, as the Minister said. There seems to be a convention that an appointment will last for three years. I can think of various organisations or quangos, such as children's panels, health boards and so on, in which the Secretary of State holds the power to make appointments. We believe that that power should be controlled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
2.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand what the Minister said about flexibility, but we should not make wide general powers available to a Government Minister and allow him to go off into the wide world and exercise them. Our anxiety has been increased by recent abuses, for example, the intervention of Ministers at the highest level in what appeared to be a little local problem—that of Paisley grammar school. The education legislation was sufficiently wide to enable the Secretary of State for Scotland, out of the blue, to block the regulations tabled last week and usurp the plans of Strathclyde regional council, which were well advanced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is an example of abuse of the power invested in Ministers. Members of Parliament have a duty to ensure that the Executive is properly controlled, and we will not be doing our job properly if we give them unfettered power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My arguments are similar to those advanced in support of the previous set of amendments, because the principle is fundamental to both. There must be control over the Executive. I reiterate that it cannot be guaranteed that an office will always be held by a responsible person, or that the powers will be exercised as the Minister says that they will be. The Minister is a lawyer, as I am. He knows that what he says will have no effect on the way in which the courts will interpret the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Secretary of State, in his wisdom, and using his sole, unfettered discretion, decides to make a lifetime appointment of his best friend or his wife, legally no one can stop him, because that power is in the Bill. It must be restricted. I would argue for that fundamental principle if my party were in Government and had presented the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for citing specific and straightforward precedents for the terminology of the legislation, which I accept. Nevertheless, like my honourable Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South, I believe that such drafting is disturbing. In this case, the precedent should be ignored. A responsible and diligent Parliament should not give unfettered discretion to any Secretary of State, especially the present one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister made some interesting remarks about the nature of the appointment in its early stages and how, before it was up and running, there might be a case for a short-term appointment. That made alarm bells ring in my mind. I have a copy of a report in 	<i>The Scotsman</i> which appeared at about the time of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0279">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>365</span>
the debate on Second Reading. It was entitled, "Homing in on the top job" and showed pictures of various people, including the Earl of Ancram, whom my honourable Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths) will recall. The report was by David Scott, an extremely well-informed and authoritative correspondent on local government affairs in Scotland. He wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Since losing his Edinburgh South seat, Mr. Ancram has been involved in journalistic and public relations activities but is clearly waiting in the wings for a new political or public service role. Some doubts over his availability for the Scottish Homes post will be the main obstacle. Mr. Rifkind, it is understood, is anxious that Mr. Ancram should play a key part in developing and promoting Tory policies in Scotland and it is also likely that the former housing and environment Minister would want to return to full-time politics at the next General Election.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>However, the Scottish Homes chairmanship will be a part-time post and, if appointed, Mr. Ancram could hold it for at least three years before contesting another election. Mr. Rifkind would inevitably face 'jobs for the boys' accusations but, from his point of view, Mr. Ancram, as the man who has been totally committed and enthusiastic about the planned housing reforms, would be the ideal person to bring them to fruition in their early stages."</p></blockquote>
That is an alarming thought.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My honourable Friend mentioned "jobs for the boys". After three years, it may be unemployment for the boys if those Conservatives contest another election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suppose that Michael Ancram will eventually get a seat in the House of Lords. He is unemployed now and I should prefer him to remain so. I do not think that he would be a suitable person to perform the important task of chairman of Scottish Homes. It could be said that the Government are creating a framework of legislation that would make jobs for the boys possible. We realise that there are many boys who require jobs at present. My honourable Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South went through the list of Tories who had been sacked by the Scottish electorate last year and some have been given jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Peter Fraser kept his old job but managed to obtain a higher salary because he is no longer a Minister in Parliament. Alex Fletcher is on the board of the Scottish Development Agency. I wonder what time limit is on that appointment. Now, we have authoritative speculation that the notorious Michael Ancram could be in line for the chairmanship of Scottish Homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my honourable Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South who said that it seems like a lax way of drafting legislation even though there are precedents by Governments of every complexion. Parliament is interested in applying proper scrutiny over the activities of the Executive and in controlling its powers. That matter is especially important in Scotland at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State for Scotland has absolute power in many instances, but he is beholden to no one and can do exactly what he likes. He can rely on the honourable Member for Wanstead and Woodford to support him through thick and thin. What the Secretary of State for Scotland does will
	<span class='label label-info column'>366</span>
have no bearing on the honourable Member for Wanstead and Woodford or his constituents. However, his loyalty to the Conservative party leads him to support the proposals of the Secretary of State for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The experience of that oppressive and capricious minority rule by the Secretary of State for Scotland that is causing great offence and distress in many parts of Scotland, should caution us about the risks of giving such a Secretary of State for Scotland wide-ranging powers in the future and about extending his existing wide-ranging powers. The Secretary of State for Scotland, with a minority Administration, is seeking to perpetuate unnecessarily wide-ranging powers. There should be a limit on contracts for members of Scottish Homes, particularly for the chairman of Scottish Homes. Three years would be a reasonable period, obviously with scope for reappointment if everyone were satisfied with the way that the job was being done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am fascinated. The honourable Gentleman suggests that the appointment should last for three years. I do not understand why he says three years any more than I understand why he suggested in his last amendment that there should be 15 rather than nine members. If it were three years, what would be the basis for reappointment or non-reappointment? Would it be suitability or unsuitability? In the last amendment the honourable Gentleman argued that suitability and unsuitability were inappropriate words for the appointment. That is farcical. The honourable Gentleman is arguing against himself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find the honourable and learned Gentleman's arguments about suitability and unsuitability helpful. Initially, it seemed to me that that term was redundant and was not needed in the Bill. The honourable and learned Gentleman has explained that it serves a purpose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I asked the honourable Gentleman to suggest a better one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman is being less than fair. I felt that the term "unable or unfit to discharge the functions" covered the point. We must not return to that debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There should be a time limit on such appointments. Parliament should not put such a power in the hands of the Secretary of State for Scotland. That is why I feel inclined to stick to my guns on the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 109 in page 41, leave out lines 20 to 26.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the amendment would be to delete paragraph 7(3) from the Bill. The paragraph proposes that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where a person (other than the chief executive)"—</p></blockquote>
obviously, separate arrangements are made for him—
	<br><blockquote><p>"ceases to be a member of Scottish Homes otherwise than on the expiry of his term of office, and it appears to the Secretary of State that there are special circumstances which might make it right for that person to receive compensation, the Secretary of State may, with the approval of the Treasury, direct Scottish Homes to make that person a payment of such amount as the Secretary of State may, with the approval of the Treasury, determine."</p></blockquote>
The Committee has spent much time today discussing the appointment of members to the board of Scottish Homes and its composition, with a view to ensuring that certain interests are represented. The Minister has given us some assurances, but we shall wait to see how watertight they are in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0281">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>369</span>
However, we must raise our concern about paragraph 7(3), because it appears to introduce a new aspect into housing legislation. It seems that it will allow the Secretary of State, who has the power to dismiss a board member or to dispense with his services, to compensate him for the loss of his position on the board. There are a number of ideological points that I want to make about that, because it appears to tie in with what we have said about the develoment of Scottish housing and how Scottish Homes will assist in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have argued before that the Bill will completely change the structure and position of Scottish housing. It will introduce a new element into it which has nothing to do with the basic ideas which honourable Members on both sides of the Committee have recognised, such as the need to provide cheap, reasonable housing of good quality. The problem of homelessness will not be tackled. Housing will simply be regarded as an investment. Here we see the Secretary of State being given unfettered powers to appoint the members of a new body which will concentrate heavily on privatisation of and investment in housing—it will be able to lend in exactly the same way as banks and building lend, for example. He is also being given the power to make separate payments, which may develop into the power to pay transfer fees, for all we know. The power is completely new.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consitution of the Housing Corporation which appears in the Housing Associations Act 1985 contains no such power. It states that the Secretary of State—not the Secretary of State for Scotland—
	<br><blockquote><p>"may pay the … Deputy Chairman and members such remuneration as he may, with the consent of the Treasury, determine".</p></blockquote>
That is perfectly reasonable, as the deputy chairman and members are giving up their valuable time to perform a valuable public function. However, nowhere is there a reference to severance pay or entitlement to it. There is the ability to pay a pension, which again is appropriate and I would not argue against it, and we see a similar provision in paragraph 8 of the schedule, where the Secretary of State has the power to make such an arrangement for certain members of the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one further disturbing aspect of the provision. Even in respect of the payment of pensions which the Secretary of State may make under the Housing Associations Act 1985 to certain members of the board of the Housing Corporation, paragraph 6(2) of schedule 6 to that Act, which contains the constitution of the Housing Corporation, states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As soon as may be after the making of such a determination—</p></blockquote>
that determination being the determination of the level of pension for those officers—
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Secretary of State shall lay before each House of Parliament a statement of the amount payable in pursuance of the determination."</p></blockquote>
That is a perfectly reasonable arrangement: the Secretary of State will determine pensions for those officers who have given their time, but thereafter he is immediately accountable to the House and must
	<span class='label label-info column'>370</span>
lay before it a statement of the amount of pensions. It is not hidden away in the corporation's accounts or something that we shall find only by examining the minute detail of the annual report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the introduction of severance pay, which highlights the commercial aspect of Scottish Homes, there is no such provision for accountability. Although we are dealing with a much larger organisation, there is no accountability. Therefore, Opposition Members are entitled to ask the Government serious and searching questions about what they intend by this brand new provision and why they believe it is necessary to make such severance payments to all board members of Scottish Homes when they did not previously see the need to pay them to Housing Corporation officers. If the Government can justify that, why do they not include in the Bill the protection given in the Housing Associations Act 1985 which enables honourable Members to scrutinise the Secretary of State's determination?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to reassure honourable Members that the provisions of paragraph 7(3) of the schedule are well precedented. A similar provision occurs in paragraph 9 of schedule 1 to the Scottish Development Agency Act 1975.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ordinary retirement pensions, allowances or gratuities and payments in cases of death are covered by paragraph 8 of the schedule. The amendment is concerned with payments made in special circumstances, not at the end of a member's term of office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This provision enables Scottish Homes and the Secretary of State to deal with unusual occurrences which may arise. Inevitably such occurrences will be rare, as I hope they will be. One example may be where a change in the tasks to which a body is directed makes it desirable to change the compositoin of the board membership to bring in new skills or knowledge, and it is necessary to ask an able member who has given good service but who is not as well placed to make a contribution of the new tasks to resign. That would be not a removal of a member under paragraph 5(3) but more in the nature of an honourable discharge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A much more common occurrence might be where a member demits office because of illness or infirmity—arising, for example, from an accident—under paragraph 5(3)(b). Other circumstances might occur to honourable Members, but I suggest that there is little to be gained from examining the range of hypothetical cases and even less from my offering a view on whether such a case might merit payment under the paragraph. The paragraph is merely a facility that will be retained in case it is needed. I suggest that the honourable Gentleman seeks leave to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be happy to consider withdrawing the amendment in the light of the Minister's explanation, provided he answers my question about the Secretary of State laying a statement before the House about the amount of any such payment. That seems to be a sensible provision
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0282">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>371</span>
in the Housing Associations Act 1985. I appreciate that no amendment is tabled on this point, but if the Minister assures me that he will look at it, I shall happily seek to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My understanding is that these provisions are based largely on the arrangements set out in the Scottish Development Agency Act 1975. Perhaps the honourable Gentleman will tell me if he seeks further information over and above that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>3.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that there is an analogy with housing, but I am sticking to the more appropriate analogy of the Housing Associations Act 1985 and the present constitution of the Housing Corporation. It seems sensible that when the Secretary of State makes a special payment of that kind—I accept the Minister's assurance that it will be an unusual occurrence—he should make a statement to the House in the same way as he is required to do by paragraph 6(2) of schedule 6 to the 1985 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman has raised a relevant point and I shall look into it. I hope to get a reference in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Bill is based closely on the Scottish Development Agency Act 1975, it also takes into account the ways in which the Housing Corporation
	<span class='label label-info column'>372</span>
has acted in the past. I shall certainly look into the honourable Gentleman's point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am happy to admit that I am not a walking encyclopaedia. I am told that the Housing Associations Act 1985 is based on an older 1964 Act. The SDA Act is clearly much more recent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That still does not answer the point, because we are talking about housing legislation and the precedent is in housing legislation. I accept that there is a more recent analogy in the Scottish Development Agency Act, but that is a housing precedent. I am not asking the Minister to accept immediately what I am proposing, but simply to give me an assurance that he will look at it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall look at the point, write to the honourable Gentleman and pursue the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
