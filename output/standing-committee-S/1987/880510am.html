</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I was saying when the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg) interrupted me, there is no reason why a director of education could not be co-opted to school boards, provided that he is not the parent of a child at the school concerned. Of course the director of education will have a status in respect of the school boards, in that they will be obliged to consider advice and he or she have a right to attend, as later provisions make clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I have covered most of the points arising on the amendments concerned with co-option, and those concerned with the definition of a parent. I have given undertakings to give consideration to that if Committee members fell that our eminently sensible and defensible line needs amendment. I do not intend to cover the more difficult territory of the question of parental majorities now as I know that several hon. Members wish to comment on that aspect so I shall respond later to points about a possible continuation of parental majority.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gordon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 145, in page 1, line 27, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"and by pupils in attendance at the school who are young persons under the Education (Scotland) Act 1980".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 90, in page 2, line 6, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>(d) persons, in the case of secondary schools (to be known as "pupils members"), who are senior pupils and who shall be elected by the pupils of the school.</p></blockquote>
No. 89, in clause 4, page 4, line 12, after "Board", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"in the case of an elected senior pupil".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the amendment is self-evident. It is serious and worth while and should be taken into account. The Government's proposals are that the electorates for school boards are effectively parents who have children at a given school and that they should be the only people to have the right to elect parent members. The clause seeks to extend that right to pupils at the school over the age of 16. The proposal would obviously commend itself not only to the pupils, who would have a direct say in the direction of the school and with the people taking policy decisions, but to a wider community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0886">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>241</span>
The school-leaving age is 16, so by extending the franchise effectively to those who choose to stay on at 16, we are by definition talking about pupils who wish to be at school, who have a direct interest in further studies at the school and probably thereafter, and who are clearly showing a degree of academic maturity that warrants their views being taken into account. I have often challenged the Government's view that the consumers of education are the parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consumers of education are the children, but, because they are under age, their parents and guardians are statutorily responsible for ensuring that they receive full-time education. However, that is no longer so when pupils reach the age of 16, when there is no statutory requirement for them to stay on at school. I do not deny that parental influence is important, but it is primarily the pupils themselves who elect whether to stay on at school. They should be encouraged to participate in elections relating to their school boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government and the Minister are in favour of consumerism and consumer choice, so as a side issue, it is fair to record that the Consumers Association would support an amendment such as this one. I must qualify that statement by saying that I do not endorse all of what the Consumers Association has said about the Bill. However, this proposal has some merit, and I put it forward in a genuine spirit of constructive inquiry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should tell us what the role of pupils is. If he is so keen to extend democracy, young people between the ages of 16 and 18 who are at school should be encouraged to participate in it. They are the ones who will be affected, and they could represent the interests of younger children. No one is suggesting that children under the age of 16 should have a vote, although they should have a say. It is likely that pupils over the age of 16 will wish to take account of preferences expressed by younger pupils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parents, teachers and Government Ministers are not always the best judges of what makes good schools and good teachers. Talking to pupils gives a better idea of who is a good teacher and why and what is a good, constructive atmosphere in a school. That is particularly true if one talks to pupils who have a clear and positive interest in pursuing education, rather than those who are there under sentence of law and are anxious to leave.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Pupils could also provide a useful input to the board. I am not suggesting at this stage that they should be able to elect any of their own number. The amendment suggests that, as part of the constituency, they should be entitled to choose which of the parent representatives they prefer. In those circumstances, they are unlikely to be the majority of the voters, but their views should be taken into account. Many parents would find it useful to hear senior pupils' worries about equipment, discipline and the general running, atmosphere and academic state of the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I anticipate the criticism that it is inappropriate effectively to allow young people to act as judges of their teachers. I repeat that the amendment merely gives pupils the right to participate in the election of parent board members. Pupils may often have access to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>242</span>
information that is not directly available to parents and may be able to provide a different perspective on the information that is available. For example, pupils might be able to stress that differentials in exam results could be due to internal circumstances that could be changed and are not necessarily an adverse or unduly positive comment on the atmosphere within the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment deals with young people who will reach their legal majority in two years and will then be able to vote in parliamentary and local elections. It would help to prepare them for that role by encouraging them to participate in elections that directly affect the running of their school. That would be a reasonable way of introducing them to the democratic process. The amendment is modest, because it simply encourages them to participate in a healthy and constructive way. I hope that the amendment will be treated in a constructive way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be delighted if the Minister accepts the amendment, but, if he does not, what steps could usefully be taken to ensure that senior pupils will be involved in the running of their schools? School boards will significantly change the way in which schools are run. Pupils should be encouraged to have a say in that. I should like to give them more say than the amendment proposes, but I have deliberately pitched the amendment in modest terms so that it can fit into the Bill, and not fundamentally alter the structure of the boards or the way in which they operate. The amendment will ensure that senior pupils are treated in a responsible manner and encouraged to respond accordingly. I hope that the Committee regards that as a constructive development that has wider implications in the long run, is healthy for democracy, and will create good citizens who accept responsibility for their own community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cumbernauld and Kilsyth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the view of the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) and his amendment. Amendment No. 90 develops his case, because it suggests that pupil members could be elected members of the board. They would be elected by their peer group, or by another arrangement that we could discuss later. It is important for senior pupils to be given a sense of belonging to the school, such as they have in the existing framework. If a new framework for school management is to be established, pupils must be able to identify with it. Being involved in school boards will widen their education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We tabled the amendments because the present proposals do not go far enough. Many 18-year-old pupils are mature. They have the right to vote in parliamentary and local government elections. None of us visits schools without bearing that point in mind. Senior pupils must be treated as adults and as people who are able to make judgments, such as how they will vote for immensely important bodies. The best way to encourage pupils to do that is to give them a full place as of right on a school board. I agree with the hon. Member for Gordon that his proposals will not drastically alter the nature of the board. Even if he took the further step of a pupil being elected, he would agree that it will not change radically the nature of the board, but it would give senior pupils a sense of involvement in school management. As the hon.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0887">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>243</span>
Member for Gordon said, senior pupils will wish to make contributions when the board considers matters that directly affect pupils—such as the head teacher's report and the school's attainment and performance. They will wish also to contribute to matters that are of less importance, but which are still important to young people, such as school uniforms, which are often a controversial subject, especially when headmasters are a trifle reluctant to accept adaptations that take account of passing fashion. That has happened in Scottish schools. It would be useful if pupils could contribute, but that is not as important as assessing a school and considering its attainment record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will consider our amendments to see whether something can be done to embrace our ideas, and will not reject them out of hand. If a school board's objective is to achieve a management unit in which there is a consensus among parents, teachers and the school community as a whole, we must ensure that all interests are properly represented. I shall come back to that point when we consider teacher representation and the definitions of "a teacher" and "non-teaching staff". For the moment, I shall content myself with what I have said. I hope that the Minister will take on board the points that we have made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not unsympathetic to either of the amendments, but the Bill provides for the purpose that lies behind them. On amendment No. 145, in the name of the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce), a view has been put forward by the Scottish Consumer Council, and it is based on its clear commitment to increase consumer involvement in schools. The Government appreciate the help, support and advice of the Scottish Consumer Council, but the argument, although ingenious, is flawed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument is that pupils over the age of 16 have certain legal rights that become theirs rather than those of their parents, and, as the Bill is about extending parental rights, those rights should be extended to older pupils. There is an apparent logic in that argument, but I do not accept it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to recognise that the Bill gives rights to parents as consumers of the service, not because parents are the direct clients of the service but because they pay for it and have a legal and moral responsibility for their children's education. A pupil who has passed statutory school age is not, by that simple fact, independent of his parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment of the hon. Member for Gordon is technically deficient. It would give rights to children over 16 years of age but under 18 years of age, so it would deny a vote to senior pupils of 18 and over, whereas their younger colleagues would have voting rights. I am sure that that is not the hon. Gentleman's intention, but it is another good reason for not accepting the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 90 in the name of the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg) would go further. It seeks to provide for pupil members of boards.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>244</span>
The Bill already provides for that under the provisions for co-option. Clause 4(2) provides that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A minor may be a member of a School Board"—</p></blockquote>
a minor being a girl of 12 years or more or a boy of 14 years or more, both being under 18 years of age. Theoretically, the Bill allows relatively young pupils to be co-opted on to school boards. Clause 6(1) allows boards to invite anyone, including pupils, to
	<br><blockquote><p>"attend any of their meetings and to speak".</p></blockquote>
Moreover, if a board wants to co-opt a pupil who, as the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth wishes, is elected by his or her fellow pupils, there is no reason why an informal election cannot be run within the school. But there is no reason why we should put specific requirements into the Bill that permanently tie secondary schools to having pupil members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does that not open the possibility of the teacher's pet being put on the board, as opposed to the pupil whom the rest of the school is confident will represent its interests?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman was listening. I said that it would be open to schools to organise an election if they choose. It is extraordinary to hear an argument from the hon. Gentleman suggesting that we should prescribe and limit the freedom of individual school boards to choose what is appropriate for them. The hon. Gentlemen's opposition to the Bill has been based on the mistaken assertion that it increases power at the centre. Every Opposition amendment has sought to be prescriptive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is a happy consensus within the Committee that pupils have a role to play in school boards, the Committee should recognise that the Bill provides for that role to be achieved, if that is the wish of the school boards and of individual schools. It would be wrong to be unduly prescriptive, because we cannot anticipate every possibility and eventuality. I am certain that school board members—whether parents, teachers, or co-opted members will see the wisdom of involving pupils. But we suggest that it would be inappropriate for younger pupils to be co-opted on to school boards and that we should co-opt more senior pupils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that there is a consensus in the Committee about pupil representation on school boards, but, because the Bill permits as few as four parent representatives to form a majority on a school board, it is likely that they could co-opt their offspring on to the board. Prejudice could then enter into the operation of the board. Surely it is better for pupils to elect their representatives than to have them chosen by a small group of parents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member makes a point about how some boards might behave. Parent members of boards will be accountable to other parents through the ballot box. If they behave in a way that parents consider reprehensible or unfair, it will be reflected in future elections. We believe in devolving power to individual boards and people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Except councils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman means that we wish to take power from councils, he is right. But we do not wish to take that power for ourselves; we wish to devolve it to parents. That is the Bill's purpose. By supporting the amendment of the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce), the hon. Gentleman argues for limiting the freedom and opportunity of individual school boards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To make particular choices.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The choices made by school boards may not always be wise, but they will be made by them and will be accountable to parents. I am not inclined to accept either amendment. Amendment No. 145 is technically deficient and logically flawed. The aim of amendment No. 90 can be achieved by school boards, if they so wish. If the amendments are pressed, I shall ask my hon. Friends to reject them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his initial expression of sympathy both with my amendment and with that tabled by the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg), but I was a little disappointed that, at the end of the day, his radicalism failed him. I am willing to accept that my amendment is technically deficient, but I am sure that the Committee could resolve that if it has a mind so to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the structure of the Scottish further education system, will the Minister tell us how many pupils over the age of 18 are in secondary schools in Scotland? It would be interesting to know how many will be disfranchised as a result of my amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments represent a serious attempt to ensure that school boards include people who have something to contribute. It is not simply a question of giving them rights; the information and advice that they can contribute is valuable and could be used. That is why I am disappointed that the Minister has lost his full radical thrust. I am sure that, were he not on the Front Bench but on the Back Benches, he would wish to embrace my proposal. We should trust mature pupils. My amendment is more modest than that of the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth, although I wholly support his amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point about co-option is not good enough. If the Minister is sympathetic to the general thrust of the amendment, the Government should actively encourage co-option of senior pupils by means of public statements and guidelines issued to school boards. Co-option should be by a method that ensures that a representative is selected on the basis of wide consultation, or even by an election. That would go a long way to meeting the objectives of the amendments. However, without that assurance, I shall press my amendment to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can help the hon. Gentleman. Offhand, I cannot tell him how many pupils will be disfranchised by his amendment. However, unlike him, I tend to weigh arguments on the basis of their value, not on the basis of numbers. My point was that it would be anomalous to give a vote to some pupils and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>246</span>
deny it to those who are 18 or over. It would be absurd for senior pupils to be denied the franchise when younger pupils have it, which would be the effect of amendment No. 145.

We shall discuss guidance to school boards when we look at the co-option of church representatives to school boards, in the context of amendments tabled the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth and my right honourable Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith). We shall issue guidance on co-option to encourage school boards to look at their composition and to seek to use co-option to fill any gaps in expertise on the school board. We shall encourage them to consider co-opting senior pupils, but we shall not issue prescriptive guidelines. For example, we shall not require boards to co-opt businessmen, churchmen or, indeed, senior pupils. However, we shall encourage them to take account of such groups when deciding which people to co-opt on to school boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot accept the hon. Gentleman's amendment, but I assure him that the guidance that we issue to school boards will encourage them to give serious consideration to his arguments for co-opting pupils to the boards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Knox. Something extraordinary has happened. We have a new member of the Committee. I do not know how we should have been notified, but it seems that interest in Scottish school boards has stretched all the way to Gravesend. Can you explain, Mr. Knox, whether an hon. Member rejoicing in the name of Mr. Jacques Arnold is a relation of Dr. Arnold of Rugby, a school that is represented on the Committee by the Minister of State, Scottish Office. Is there a connection? Do the Government intend again to change the membership of the Committee? If the Government can make changes, the Opposition may wish to do the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government Whip waves his arms about and points to unoccupied seats in the Committee Room—he is right to do so—but is it in order for me to announce changes to the Opposition's membership of the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to say that the Chair is not responsible for what the Government or the Opposition do. I understand that, last week, the Committee of Selection selected the hon. Member for

If either condition obtains in respect of any Opposition Member, the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Every time I attend a Standing Committee, The Chairman explains that he has little power. That is disappointing. If The Chairman had real power, he could deal with such matters. It seems odd that the hon. Member for Dorset, South (Mr. Bruce), who benefited from his membership of the Committee in that he received a wider vision of education, is not present today. He has been replaced by the hon. Member for Gravesham (Mr. Arnold). What can be done to impress upon hon. Members who are co-opted to the Committee that they should attend its sittings?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the hon. Member for Dorset, South (Mr. Bruce) was present earlier. The hon.

As the hon. Gentleman rightly said, The Chairman has little power in these matters, but I am not sure that he would like it if Chairmen had more power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kincardine and Deeside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 128, in page 2, line 6, and end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"one of whom shall be a person interested in the promotion of religious education in co-opting whom the Board shall have due regard to churches, denominational bodies and religious groups having duly constituted charges or other regularly appointed places of worship in the area mainly served by the school."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"with the exception of ministers of religion."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome my hon. Friend the Member for Gravesham (Mr. Arnold) to the Committee. I hope that he will be able to take to his part of the country a better knowledge of the superior education system in Scotland, which I should like to see spread much more widely. I also look forward to his contributions to the Committee so that we can learn from him, too. Variety in committee membership benefits all of us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I need not discuss the background reasons for the amendment. All members of the Committee will pay tribute to the strong and important role played for generations by the various churches in Scotland. We still have denominational schools, particularly of the Roman Catholic church. Last century, the Church of Scotland pioneered universal education and gave young people general access to education in Scotland. The leaders of the Church have played a thoroughly positive, constructive and evolving role in the Scottish education system for centuries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The system changed from general church education to public education relatively smoothly and easily, and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>248</span>
preserved the principle of general access to education. One of the characteristics of our education system was the willingness of the Church of Scotland to change to a public system, which it supported over the years. The various education Acts have recognised the positive role that the Church has played. For example, the membership of education committees has given Church representatives the opportunity to take part in the education system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is what lies behind the amendment. When we consider a new development in our education system such as the establishment of school boards, we should recognise the role that the Church can play and has played for generations. It is even more relevant to school boards, because they will represent the community in which the school operates. I am glad to say that in most communities in Scotland the role of the Church is still fairly strong, and ministers and priests are still considered as leaders of the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those historical reasons—historical in the sense not of sentiment but of a proven contribution to education in Scotland—we should recognise the role of the churches and of their individual leaders in education in the community. Special provision should be made for those who represent that important strand in the Scottish education system to be co-opted on to school boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why I have moved the amendment. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will consider it sympathetically.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McFall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the right honourable Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith). We welcome the comments of the Church of Scotland and of the Roman Catholic church in Scotland. We understand their anxiety because they have had an integral, dynamic role in education in Scotland over many years. This Bill changes the system and due regard should be paid to the interests of the churches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 128 appears to be technically defective and I should like to know the Minister's view on it. It includes the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"one of whom shall be a person interested in the promotion of religious education".</p></blockquote>
Who is that person? That is not tied down tightly enough. We are worried about that aspect of the amendment, and the Minister's comments on it will be important. I stress the importance of the role of the churches over the years and of their anxieties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly understand the thrust of the amendment and I support its broad principles although I have one or two reservations that it is, in the Minister's terms, too prescriptive. All of us fully acknowledge the record of the Church of Scotlands in its contribution to Scottish education. Indeed, the Church has played a distinctive role in ensuring that Scotland had universal education substantially before the whole of the rest of Europe. As Scottish Members of Parliament, we are all proud of that and feel that it should always be acknowledged. To that extent, the continuing interest of the Church should be welcomed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>249</span>
There are, however, some practical problems. The Church of Scotland is not the only church and this amendment is not restricted to the Church of Scotland. In some communities, there is mixed denomination and non-denomination and a suitable person may not be available. For example, in a rural area the local priest or minister may not be an appropriate person in terms of approach and interests or may be too committed in other areas to be able to play an active role. Prescribing that such a person should be on the board might restrict the availability of a more suitable person.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that the amendment may not be correct in all its detail, but it does not specify an ordained member of a church. It specifies a person interested in the promotion of religious education. It is not confined to an individual ordained member of a particular church in a particular area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The subsequent amendment makes it perfectly clear that we are talking about a minister of religion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am merely expressing, in the context of the debate, a slight reservation about being too prescriptive. I accept that neither amendment is trying to tie things down too specifically, but the number of co-options is limited and if the boards were obliged to take a particular person—one amendment draws the definition more widely than the other—that would in some circumstances narrow the option of the board to co-opt the best people. It is right and proper for us to bear fully in mind denominational and religious educational interests, but to prescribe that a minister of religion or someone with a particular religious background should be co-opted may be going too far and may restrict the options.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some communities, there could be conflicts if there is substantial division across denominations. I shall risk treading in the lion's den and say that I could imagine parts of the Western Isles where such conflicts might arise. That is the only proviso which I believe that the Committee should take into account. I am sympathetic to both amendments, but we should be aware of the difficulties that they could produce.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce), I am aware of the practical problems associated with the amendment. I know that we should not try to be too prescriptive and lay down what school boards must do in relation to co-opting. The problem of people, say, in the Western Isles, possibly being co-opted on to the board under prescription who might not be suitable candidates has already been raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we are prescriptive about existing Scottish education authorities which have to contain representatives of the Catholic church, the Church of Scotland and of other churches. I served on the education authority in Tayside region and was impressed by the contribution made not only by the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>250</span>
Catholic representatives, but by the others. The region got round the problems by having elections amongst the different groups to choose their representative. There was a Roman Catholic church representative. Church of Scotland representative, and the other churches came together to elect a representative. Those representatives made an important contribution to the authority's work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same applies to the school councils, as the representative of the churches on the school board does not have to be an ordained minister of religion. I know from my work on school councils that the Catholic church nominates lay people to represent them, and it would be perfectly acceptable for the other churches to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is essential to retain the traditional link between the churches and education in Scotland which has contributed greatly to the development of Scottish education. Practical problems can be overcome if the Government have the will to liaise with the church authorities to find practical ways in which their views can be represented on the school boards. If the Minister seriously believes that the legislation will contribute significantly towards the development of education in future, he must justify his decision to exclude the Church of Scotland and other churches from any participation on the boards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not excluding anyone from participating on the boards, and I am sympathetic to the amendment tabled by my right honourable Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith). We intend to issue guidelines recommending that boards consider choosing a representative of church interests when selecting their co-opted members, but we did not intend that to be a statutory requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) asked about the meaning of the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"person interested in … religious education".</p></blockquote>
That time-honoured term, which has a long history, was used in the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973. It is normally interpreted as meaning a minister or priest. However, the hon. Gentleman is right to say that it would not necessarily have to be such a person. Church interests could be well represented on a board after the election has taken place as one of the parent members might well be a local minister. Thus, the board would not need to seek further church representation. A statutory requirement to do so could unbalance the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In answer to my right honourable Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside, it is right to leave the decisions about which interests should be directly represented on the board for the board to decide itself, in the light of its own assessment of local needs and priorities. Church interests should come high on that list of priorities, but we do not wish to insist on that in statute as non-denominational education authority schools are not church schools. We wonder whether it would be wise to establish a single board seat as the church seat for non-denominational schools. Often, there will be no doubt about which church is the major
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0891">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>251</span>
local interest but that is not always the case. I have a letter from someone in the Free Church manse in Sleat on the Isle of Skye who has a different view about what would be an appropriate way of responding to church interests. There are many different, competing, religious interests that could make a claim to such a seat. In some parts of Scotland, the strong views of those with no faith or denomination must be considered. The establishment of a single church seat could exacerbate local differences so it would be better to leave flexibility for those to be resolved locally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions of clause 6(3) and 6(10) may offer my right honourable Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside some comfort as they allow boards to bring in additional expertise outwith board membership. Therefore, it is not true to say that a board which has no church member will necessarily turn its back on church advice or counsel. There will be an opportunity for boards to include churchmen or others with an interest in religious education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are sympathetic to the underlying purpose of amendment No. 129, but our intention in making the membership categories of boards exclusive is clear. We want to establish boards with a parental majority and we do not want boards whose members are all parents or all teachers. I appreciate that the amendment would make an exception only for a local minister of religion, but in a board with two co-opted members, one staff member and four parent members, the amendment could leave the board with five parent members and only two others—one co-opted and one staff. If two denominations were locally strong, there could be six parent members in a seven member board. We know that the Committee is anxious about the balance of parents on a board, so I am sure that I shall have support if I say that if I accepted the amendment, it would be difficult to resist similar exceptions for other categories, resulting in a considerable imbalance in board structures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reluctantly, I must tell my right honourable Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside that I cannot accept his amendment, although I understand his intentions. I hope that he will recognise that there are provisions in the Bill that will enable the church to continue to play the valuable role that it has done historically.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the consideration that my hon. Friend has given to the amendments. I understand the practical problems to which he referred on amendment No. 129. However, he raises too many practical difficulties, as did the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce), about the problems in some areas of Scotland in deciding who might represent religious interests, if my amendment were accepted. I acknowledge that there would be problems but they should not be exaggerated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the characteristics of the more heavily populated areas in Scotland is the growth of the ecumenical movement. It is not unusual in the communities that I know best for services to be arranged for youth organisations and for all the churches in the area to cooperate, often on a rotational basis. Services are held in the different churches and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>252</span>
are taken by all the ministers in turn. All share in the services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sceptical of the suggested difficulties that may result from the amendment, although I acknowledge that in some areas there may be problems. I understand that my hon. Friend the Minister does not wish to prescribe precisely who should be co-opted to the boards, because that would limit those sections of the community from which other members of a board might be drawn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried about the size of school boards, and in a sense support my hon. Friend's argument that prescribing a place for one section of the community makes it more difficult for a small school. However, the argument cuts both ways. If a place on a small school board is not prescribed for the representative of a religious interest, it is less likely that the board will have such a representative. My hon. Friend said that he has still not decided on the size of the boards. He knows my views about teacher representation, which coloured my attitude to an earlier amendment about parental majority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that in considering the size and composition of school boards my hon. Friend will take into account the fact that at the lower end of the banding system described in the consultation document the numbers on the boards are limited and so, therefore are the different backgrounds and interests of the representatives. I hope that he will consider the matter in that light.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend has assured us that when issuing advice on the interests appropriate for those who will be co-opted to the boards he will suggest representatives of religious and church organisations. I am sure that when the Bill is enacted guidance will be issued on the interests of those representatives. In that spirit, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is important as everyone agrees that head teachers are key figures in schools. Speaking from my own experience as a pupil in a Scottish secondary school, the head teacher performed an important role. To this day, my mother believes that my school—St. Augustine's in Glasgow—never recovered from the replacement of Mr. Murray as head teacher. She insists that the school went downhill ever since he was replaced. When I was a teacher in a secondary school, I knew the importance of head teachers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Neil Toppin gave sterling service at St. Augustine's for over a decade. That was recognised in Strathclyde and throughout Scotland. My hon. Friend's views of the head teachers at that school are at variance with the views of those who know intimately that area of Glasgow and that school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a fair point. Mr. Neil Toppin came to the school long after I had
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>254</span>
departed. I was referring to the head teacher between Mr. Murray and Mr. Toppin. I am sure that Mr. Toppin did a magnificent job and that the school has recovered. My mother was speaking only from her direct experience as a parent of children at the school at that time. It is important to remember that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a teacher, I realised the important role played by head teachers in secondary schools and as a teacher in a list D school, I can vouch that those schools tended to be better or worse depending on who the head teacher was. I have found, through my experience in schools, that head teachers play a key role. They provide an essential link between different interests in education from the education authority to the school and to the parents and pupils attending the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The head teacher is under direct contract to the education authority and is an employee of that authority, and thus is responsible, through the director of education, for the education policies pursued locally by education authorities and for ensuring that those policies are implemented at school level. The head teacher is responsible not only to the director of education, but to the elected councillors who control the director of education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Through the councillors a head teacher is indirectly responsible to those who vote in regional council elections. He performs an important role. He is also responsible for the day-to-day running of schools. Matters such as discipline will often revolve around the head teacher, and he will also be concerned with the curriculum and staff relationships. All such matters are involved in the successful running of a school, and that success depends to a great extent on the head teacher. It is important that he is a member of the school board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government produced a document on school management following the consultation process. It included a question and answer section very much like the one on poll tax. At best, they insult the intelligence of the electorate. One of the questions concerned the head teacher's position and whether he or she should be a voting member of the board. In the answer it says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Boards are not intended to usurp the position of the head teacher".</p></blockquote>
Opposition Members are less than convinced by that argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[MR. BILL WALKER 	<i>in the Chair.]</i></p>
	<p>I am pleased to see that Mr. Walker has taken the Chair in the absence of the Chairman. He has been quiet this morning, given the results of the Perth and Kinross district elections. His party suffered a severe reverse in his own constituency.</p>
	<p>There is a real danger that boards will usurp the role of head teachers, especially as the Minister has made it clear the he wants a parent majority on school boards and that those parents can be elected on party-political tickets. There could be Tory, Labour or SNP boards dominated by the parent majority who can impose their will directly on a head teacher.</p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for pointing out that I am responsible for Government legislation and that it is up to me to amend it.

As the hon. Gentleman keeps raising the matter, he has the duty to suggest how we might improve the Bill to avoid that possibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister could not have said that more eloquently. The Government are content to allow that possibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the change is so profound that such issues could develop? Education in Scotland has been a co-operative exercise. Along with those who are involved in education throughout the political spectrum, we are worried about the capture of education by sectional interests. That point has been underlined to the Minister this morning, and it is incumbent on him to respond to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a fair point. The mechanism that the Minister is setting up through the Bill will allow sectional interests to take over school boards and, through that media, to dominate much of the education in schools. The Minister has not referred to that problem, he simply hopes that it will not happen. If it does, it will be the Government's responsibility, not ours. The Opposition would not introduce a Bill that provides for the setting up of such boards. The Minister is opening up the possibility of head teachers coming under the dominance of local sectional interests. We oppose that. He must deal with the problem of head teachers being usurped by the parental majority on school boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question and answer section of the document to which I referred goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The boards will enhance the authority of headteachers by providing a local focus for decision making on local matters."</p></blockquote>
Everyone supports that idea, but the unfortunate point that the Minister is driving home is that the head teacher, who is perhaps the most important local influence on education, will be excluded from having any real influence over his school by not being made a full member of the board and not being able to exercise
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>256</span>
his right to vote on important decisions affecting the way in which he runs his school. It is all very well setting up local centres of decision making, but to exclude one of the most important local persons is heading for trouble.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government document goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The fact that headteachers will not vote on their boards is intended to reflect their special status".</p></blockquote>
It is a weird argument for the Government to say that they accept that head teachers have a special status within schools and have an important role to play, yet not allow them to exercise any influence over the decisions of school boards on essential matters. If head teachers are so special, why will they not be allowed to vote on issues that affect the way in which they perform their duties as head teachers?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answer section concludes by saying that
	<br><blockquote><p>"in an extreme case, a headteacher might need to distance him or herself from a board decision which was professionally objectionable."</p></blockquote>
Therefore, the Government accept that school boards may reach decisions about schools that the head teachers and the staff of those schools would find reprehensible and morally objectionable. For that reason, the head teacher will be excluded from having a vital say in the running of his school. More than anything else, the provision is about the Minister's determination to have a parental majority on each school board, and not to allow any other community interest to have a say that would affect that majority. He is concerned that if the head teacher's vote were aligned with the staff and other community interests on a board, the parental majority may be overturned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stress again that school councils have written to me from Dundee objecting to the concept of the parental majority acting like a dictatorship within the school board in defiance of professionals and other parties that should be represented on it. I am doubly concerned that the Minister is content to accept parental majorities that could be based on party-political and other sectional interests, and then to impose on all the other interests of the community what might be a narrow view of how a school should perform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Head teachers are being neutured by not being allowed to vote on the way in which the schools boards are run. That is essentially what the Minister is arguing for this morning. He says that head teachers cannot have a say, cannot have any influence and cannot vote on or contribute to the making of decisions on issues vital to the running of their schools. I await the Minister's reply with interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support this group of amendments, which includes amendment No. 58 tabled in my name. Their basic thrust is to give the head teacher full voting rights and membership of the board. Many people find it extraordinary that the Government are proposing to set up school boards that specifically exclude a head teacher's right to vote. Even more extraordinary is one of the arguments for that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0894">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>257</span>
exclusion, which is that the head teacher may wish to disown the decisions of the board, even though that head teacher would have to implement them. That is not a recipe for a constructive atmosphere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several points arise from that. First, we have already mentioned our anxieties about the small number of teacher representatives on the board. It seems anomalous that, depending on the size of the board, there could be one, two or three teacher representatives elected who would have a vote and who might seek to use that vote against their head teacher. There may be genuine differences of view about education priorities, but there may also be petty personal reasons. For head teachers to have no balancing vote puts them in an invidious position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[Mr. DAVID KNOX 	<i>in the Chair]</i></p>
	<p>Like other hon. Members, I have had meetings in my constituency with teachers and parents. There is genuine concern about the implications on both counts. The most commonly expressed is that head teachers might fear that the school boards could be taken over not by a group representative of all the parents, but by a vocal minority who wished to use the board to put their own idiosyncratic views or simply to support the interests of their own children, regardless of whether or not that was in the wider interests of the school.</p>
	<p>One head teacher who has been a dedicated primary school teacher for many years said that she had seriously considered leaving teaching because she could not run her school if certain parents were elected because other, more representative parents were less forceful. She said that in the best interests of the pupils of the school, not out of a feeling that she could not cooperate constructively with parents. Many teachers would feel resentful about being expected to implement decisions without a vote on the outcome, only the right to speak.</p>
	<p>The Minister believes that his proposals are wanted as a radical reassessment of the way schools are run. He knows that I support some elements of the Bill, although they could be applied to schools councils rather than creating school boards. However, there is little evidence that huge numbers of parents are bubbling over waiting to be involved in that process. Two weeks ago I attended a meeting organised by the parent-teacher association of Dyce academy in my constituency, to which all the staff and parents were invited—a total of about 1,500 invitations. Only 27 parents turned up. I did not regard myself as a particular attraction on that panel, but The Chairman of the education committee and the regional director of education were prepared to make themselves available to hear parents' views and to discuss the issues in an extremely constructive spirit because they accepted the thrust of the Government's legislation and were anxious to show how it could be made to work in a constructive and effective way. It was less than inspiring that the overwhelming majority of parents and teachers decided that the meeting did not interest them.</p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>258</span>
	<p>I am less anxious if the minority who attended the meeting in that particular school is likely to be the minority who participates, because a constructive atmosphere will result. In other schools in my constituency, the minorities who have expressed an interest are not a constructive influence and do not represent the general opinions in the schools.</p>
	<p>The Minister should recognise the legitimate concerns of head teachers. They are confused because although it is argued that a head teacher is the crucial ingredient in the success of a school, that his attitude, approach, dedication and responsibility in terms of school and staff morale, educational development and ideas and discipline are important, and that the ambiance of a school is created by him, he is denied the right to participate fully in the decisions of the board. That is extraordinary.</p>
	<p>The Bill does not stand up well to an analogy with business. However, it is relevant to Conservative Members because the Minister wants the board to be a radical new departure in the governing of schools, but does not want the managing director of the enterprise to have a vote in the proceedings. In a corporation he would not argue that it was appropriate for a managing director or chief executive to be excluded from full membership of the board. The method of operation is as important as the question of voting.</p>
	<p>The expression on the Minister's face shows that he is not impressed by my argument, but he should accept that he has failed so far to give interested parents and head teachers the reason for excluding head teachers from having the right to vote. No doubt he will take advantage of the amendments to explain his position. Considerable puzzlement exists in my constituency and elsewhere about why the decision has been taken and why the Government have refused to modify their position.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have considerable sympathy with aims of the amendment. I look for clarification from my hon. Friend the Minister, who is aware of my response to the consultation paper. I especially questioned the lack of voting power of the head teacher in relation to the ceiling proposals put forward by my hon. Friend in the original consultation paper. I make that distinction. I make no apology for returning to a theme that has been consistent in all my submissions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) said that we are dealing with the management of our schools. If the boards are to have executive functions, it is extraordinary that a head teacher will be excluded from having the power to vote on them. A head teacher has one of the most important positions in our educational system. He is the head of the school; he is the manager. We should depreciate anything that undermines the head teacher's authority or power and weakens the Scottish school system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to make clear the view that I expressed in my formal submission in the consultation paper. If the boards, for example, are to be more consultative in their nature, management considerations, which I believed to be the most important, will not loom as large as they did previously. Therefore, the strength of the view that I expressed in the consultation paper will not apply to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0895">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>259</span>
the proposals before us. But again, I have one proviso. By means of certain processes and subject to checks and balances provided in the Bill, the boards could move towards more executive powers than those set out in the Bill. I should like my hon. Friend the Minister to clarify that point. I anticipate that he will say that as this is not the same issue as ceiling powers, my arguments in this instance are not so powerful. If boards progress to increased powers, my arguments might have less, but still considerable, relevance in relation to the floor powers proposed in the Bill. They might have more relevance in relation to any increase in powers that the boards sought later. I should like to hear my hon. Friend's views if he plans to use that argument to reject the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second and final point deals with head teachers. I have read a number of reports from professional organisations representing head teachers. I have not had time to do much research, but I understand that those organisations have made submissions. I should be grateful if my hon. Friend the Minister could say what the views of head teachers are. I have heard reports that they may be contrary to the arguments that I advanced earlier. I should like clarification before we reach a conclusion on the amendment because I attach considerable importance to the views of head teachers on what they consider their role should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not have the necessary information, but I hope that if it is available my hon. Friend the Minister will state whether in relation to floor powers the head teachers' representations are confined to the Bill as drafted or whether a different view has been expressed in relation to any progress towards greater powers that boards may make in future. My interest in the amendment is strong but it could certainly be tempered by any information that the Minister may give in reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment. The hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) and the right honourable Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) alluded to the business analogy. I contend that it should be an organic analogy with the head teacher at the nucleus of an organic entitity. The head teacher is crucial to what happens in schools and occupies a special post of responsibility. In saying that, I draw on my experience as an ex-teacher, a parent and a politician who is involved in the community where the head teacher fulfils a crucial role. The ordinary classroom teacher believes that the role of the head teacher is crucial to the development of the school and for the encouragement of classroom teachers, who think of him as the embodiment of their wishes and aspirations. They associate themselves with his outlook and philosophy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The role of the head teacher is clearly significant for parents, too. Almost all of them perceive schools to be the embodiment of the head teacher. When they are asked how the school is doing, the name of its head teacher will undoubtedly arise in the conversation. Ten years ago, I set up a community newspaper in Dumbarton. The schools played an important part, as they did in the development of the community perspective. That would not have happened but for
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>260</span>
the schools' head teachers; other teachers showed an interest, but the head teachers gave the imprimatur.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The role of the head teacher is much wider than simply organisation within the school, but the Bill will put the head teacher in limbo between the local education authority and the parents. That cannot be good for the future of any school. The head teacher should be responsible to the local education authority, and he should be a full member of the board so that he can express not only the view of the local authority but that of teaching staff. I have experience of schools where there has been disagreement between head teachers and staff, but I believe that every member of staff wants the head teacher to occupy a pivotal role in the school. His aim is to provide the best possible education for all and to promote the corporate life of the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What do I mean by "the corporate life of the school"? It is clear that the head teacher must both represent the interests of staff and encourage them, but there is more to his role than dealing with personnel or administration—he has an external role to play in the community. In my role as a teacher and, latterly, as a head teacher, I found that parents were happy about the advice and concern proferred by senior staff in schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) that the role of the head teacher is being usurped if he is not a member of the board. Different interests have to be fused together, and how can that be done unless an individual plays an integral part—and who better to do that than the head teacher, who is responsible for formulating the aims and objectives of the school? He is responsible for implementing, monitoring and evaluating the policies that embody those aims and objectives, and—not least—for promoting the participation of all staff in those activities. The head teacher cannot do that unless he goes out into the wider community, so his millieu is much larger than that proposed in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Head teachers must be represented in the new set-up because of their pivotal position. The head teacher is there not simply as a manager or accountable person, but as someone who reflects and represents the views of many interests in society. Without his active involvement on the board and an opportunity to say whether he agrees with ideas, with his decision being recorded in writing, the organic growth of schools will be destroyed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall reply briefly to the points raised by the right honourable Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith). If we accept that the head teacher has a key role in the school, even at the base level of the floor powers involved in the consultative role, there is a good case for his having a vote on the board. We then have to consider the ceiling powers and the question of opting out. Clause 15 makes it clear that eventually each school board will be allowed to develop and embrace further functions according to its success or otherwise. If a board's role is developed from the floor towards the ceiling powers envisaged in the Bill, the head teacher's part in the board becomes more
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0896">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>261</span>
important. The right honourable Member for Kincardine and Deeside has highlighted a crucial question, to which the Minister must respond. Clearly the Government intend the school boards to evolve, so the question about the head teacher's role must be answered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third dimension is the potential opting out debate. My hon. Friends have already said that the head teacher's existing role in schools is crucial. That role can only be enhanced under the proposals, and I stress its importance. As my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) said, that person is more than simply a head teacher. In the context of parental involvement and links with the education authority, only one person is more important than anyone else, and that is the head teacher. The management role has been emphasised, as have the relations between the school and the education authority, the school and the parents, and the board and the teachers. Despite all the protestations about more parental involvement, the pivotal role in the new structure remains with the head teacher. It would be reasonable and rewarding for the Minister to accept the amendment. Any idea that the head teacher does not have a major role must be based on issues that are not evident in the Bill. There may be other reasons why the occupant of so crucial a position should be excluded from voting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already referred to a recent document, "Summary of Submission by the Scottish Parent Teacher Council in Response to the Government's Consulatation Paper 'School Management and the Role of Parents' ". It comes down against the idea of head teachers having a vote on a school boards, and states in paragraph 18:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The ability of head teachers to influence School Boards will be greater if they do not have a vote."</p></blockquote>
I believe that the opposite is true. In certain schools there will be a tendency for a more confrontational or combative role to emerge for the head teacher if he is excluded from voting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been clear in every forum in which I have participated that it is reasonable to go along and be tolerated, but if a head teacher has a positive contribution to make and can vote, that enhances the quality of his contribution and his status as a member of the school board and, subsequently, his status in the school and in the community. I do not agree with the Scottish Parent Teacher Council. There is a danger that in embracing so warmly so many aspects of the Bill, the Council is not truly reflecting a great deal of Scottish parental opinion. I support the amendment and look forward to a reasonable response from the Minister to a basic and straightforward request.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton referred to the head teacher having the overview. The head teacher will always be responsible for direct executive decisions in the school, regardless of what a school boards does. At the end of the day, the sharp end will be tackled by the head teacher. Surely it is only reasonable and moderate to request that such a person be attached to a school board in a voting capacity.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>262</span>
That is unlikely to destroy the concept of school boards or to upset parents. It certainly would not upset other teacher representatives. It would give greater credibility to school boards and would remove doubts about the Government's reasons for wishing to exclude such an important figure from voting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been an interesting debate. It became clear during consultations that many respondents felt that the head teacher should have a vote. However, now that there has been time to consider the arguments and examine the Government belief that head teachers should not have a vote, many people have changed their position. For example, not even COSLA suggested that line of approach. Indeed, it argued that the Bill should not create conflicting responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members have criticised us for not giving head teachers a vote, and have tabled an amendment that would allow head teachers to serve two masters. Head teachers are employed by the education authority and are responsible to it. They have a clear role in the management of a school. I agree firmly with my right honourable Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) about the key role of the head teacher. As a good school is usually run by a good head teacher, it follows that a good head teacher makes a good school. I am slightly puzzled that the Opposition are pressing this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) spoke of head teachers being neutered. On the contrary, they will have far more authority and power in their schools. Decisions that formerly were taken either by education committees dominated by politicians or at the centre by regional councils will in future be taken at school level. The head teacher, as the principal adviser, guide and mentor to the school board, will have more authority and power in his school. I agree with my right honourable Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside that that can result only in schools being better managed, better organised and better places of learning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) seeks to provide that head teachers be full members of the boards. He maintained that boards could be unrepresentative and that it was important for a head teacher to have a vote. The Bill already contains provisions to try to ensure that boards are representative. As we shall consider them in due course, I shall not detain the Committee by explaining them in detail now. It is a curious argument that a head teacher should be a member of a board to enable him to resist policy with which he might disagree. That would mean that he would be bound by the board's decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Gordon must surely recognise that as a head teacher is the employee of the education authority, it is important that he should be independent of the school board. As an ex officio member of the school board, he could not resign from the board unless he resigned his post. There may be occasions when the school board will take decisions with which the head
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0897">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>263</span>
teacher disagrees and which he believes conflict with his wider responsibilities to the education authority. It is important that he should not be bound by those decisions, nor be a party to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr right honourable Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside asked me to comment on the position of head teachers. We heard from the hon. Member for Gordon about meetings in his constituency and the views that had been expressed, all of which supported the arguments that he deployed in Committee. Has he spoken to any head teachers? How does he account for the fact that both the National Association of Head Teachers—which is the primary heads' representative—and the Head Teachers' Association of Scotland—which is the secondary representative—support the Bill's proposal that they should not have a vote, for the reasons that I have outlined? It represents a curious form of democracy to argue that heads should be put on school boards when they do not want that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: An interesting doctrine is being put forward. What would happen if a head teacher disagreed with a decision by a board and chose to defy that decision or not to implement it? That unhappy circumstance might arise in a school and the head teacher could be placed in an invidious position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If a decision taken by a board is competent and within its powers, he must implement it. Of course, a board may not act competently and the head teacher would wish to advise the board of that. As the employee of the education authority, he would wish to ensure that the wider obligations of the education authority, in terms of its responsibility for the provision of adequate and efficient education, were upheld.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman knows that the Bill contains provisions to deal with school boards that may find themselves in breach of conditions—perhaps in terms of delegation orders—or obligations to behave in a way consistent with the wider obligations of the education authority. The head teacher, as the employee of the education authority, is there to advise the board on such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that I have heard the hon. Member for Gordon say that head teachers would have to serve two masters. His amendments puts them in that position. The head teacher's master will be the education authority. There is no question about that. However, some of the decisions that have previously been taken at education authority level will now be taken at board level. The head teacher will have more authority, but with that extra authority will go extra accountability to the school board. If the hon. Gentleman thinks about that, he will reach the same conclusions as head teachers have. Even COSLA has come round to that view in its recognition of the need to avoid creating conflicting responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be surprised if school boards—unlike the Committee—were dominated by occasional frantic periods of voting. I do not anticipate that there will be much voting on school boards. Those bodies are not adversarial, as we are in this place. They should be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>264</span>
bodies in which a partnership between parents and teachers is developed to ensure that the best decisions are taken within the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that some matters—perhaps the more controversial ones—will be put to a vote. The head teacher will be distanced from that and, far from diminishing his status, that will enhance it. It picks him out as different from other members of the board. The school's success depends much on the success of the head teacher, and we are acknowledging that by giving him a special position in the school board structure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge my hon. Friends to reject the amendment. It is wanted by no one—not parents nor head teachers. It is based on a misunderstanding of the head teacher's role and it would place him in an impossible position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Lewis Moonie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kirkcaldy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall make a few brief comments as the Minister raised one or two points of contention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is fond of the phrase, "two masters", but three masters are involved. In most executive decisions, the head teacher is his or her own master and has little interference from the regional authority. I could cite many examples from my own region of when a head teacher simply thumbed his nose at decisions that he was supposed to implement. Effectively, the director could do nothing about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did not a head teacher recently ignore his authority and write directly to the Prime Minister to secure her involvement in an entirely local matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an excellent example of a head teacher's freedom of action. In many instances, most of us would not quarrel with that. School boards might well make decisions that a head teacher is supposed to implement but, in effect, nothing in the Bill would force him to do that, if he did not wish to do so. The school board has no powers to compel him to implement decisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The head teacher who was mentioned wrote to the Prime Minister with the full support of all his staff and parents. The education authority who was reluctant makes the point that I have sought to get across to the Committee—that the authority of the head teacher, subject to the accountability of the school boards, is endorsed and enhanced by the Bill's proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a clear example of an officer of an authority taking an action that is directly contrary to the wishes of those who employ him—that is, the education committee and his own director—and acting in total freedom with total disregard of those who, in the end, are responsible for the region's policy. That aspect will not be enhanced by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is keen to cite the views of parents and teachers, in support of his argument. Will he take account of all the other representations made about the Bill? When there is clear and compelling evidence that people support a proposal that is different from that in the Bill, will he accept that he is wrong and make the necessary changes? Of course he will not do that. The
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0898">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>265</span>
Minister uses that example simply to shore up a shaky argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is there any good reason for excluding the head teacher from the board? Is he analogous to a senior executive on a health board? I suggest that he is not, but is much more akin to an executive director of a private company—with a considerable amount of personal authority that can also be exerted on the company's policy by his sitting as an executive director on its board. That is the analogy that should be used. The Minister shakes his head—perhaps he will say why that is not so. The executive director is an excellent concept in industry and one which we could, perhaps, follow rather than the toothless spectacle of senior executives on a health board advising the board, but having no say about what goes on. It is an excellent idea and should be supported.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested to hear the Minister's somewhat contradictory arguments. He said that no one wanted the amendment, yet earlier he has said that during the consultative process it was clear that a vast majority wanted the head teacher to have a vote. That is an obvious contradiction. The Minister should explain why he tells the Committee that no one in Scotland wants the head teachers to have a vote when those who were consulted wanted them to have one. That was the absurd argument that the Minister advanced to defend his position.

The Minister said that far from head teachers being neutered, their influence and authority would be greatly enhanced by not having a vote on school boards. He said that head teachers would become guides and mentors and would have school boards in their pockets. He asserted that there was no need for parents to vote for a parent majority on school boards because the boards would be under the authority of a head teacher in any event, yet he contradicted even that argument by saying that it was important that the head teacher was independent of the school board and should not feel obliged to resign from a rebellious school board because he disagreed with its decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That argument answers none of the complaints. If the head teacher is in open conflict with a school board that has made a competent decision, what will the head teacher do? The hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) asked that pertinent question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He will ignore it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend says that the head teacher will ignore it, but some head teachers may feel obliged to resign from the school. Perhaps that is what the Minister is forcing through. He says that school boards should be about partnership between parents and schools, yet he is creating the potential for endless conflict between parents and teachers. The Minister tried to divert the argument by saying that our amendment would mean that the head teacher would serve two masters, but the legislation does that. Head teachers are employees of the education authority, and the school board will have competence in a range of issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>266</span>
The right honourable Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) rightly said when discussing the floor proposals that as school boards were to have a consultative role it was not essential that the head teacher had a vote. But the Bill enables school boards to go to the ceiling proposals and take on an executive and management role for the school's functions. That is when the potential for conflict will emerge. We must decide now whether head teachers should have a vote. Opposition Members maintain that they should if the school board wants to take on management responsibilities for the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) said that the Government have not denied that they later intend to introduce another education Bill to allow school boards to opt out of local education authority control, yet the Minister says that a head teacher will not be able to vote on whether his school is taken out of local education authority control. That is a vital consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps a Bill to enable school boards to opt out will not be introduced. The Minister said that he respects public opinion, and clearly there will be no support for such a measure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would that that were so. It would be marvellous if Ministers listened to the people of Scotland. If they did, we should have an Assembly and there would be no need for us to debate the Bill in this place. Education matters should be decided in a Scottish Assembly rather than here with English Members of Parliament deciding the outcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has put up no case whatever for excluding head teachers from the right to vote on school boards. The Bill gives school boards an important role and they have potentially an even more important role in taking over management functions. Before this Parliament is finished, school boards will probably have the power to bring their schools out of local education authority control, yet the Minister says that head teachers should have no say in such issues. We maintain that they should.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister spoke with great confidence and authority this morning. The reason for that is not difficult to find. As recently as this weekend, he addressed the Headmasters' Association of Scotland at its conference in Edinburgh and set out how he saw the operation of school boards. The 	<i>Glasgow Herald,</i> leaving aside Harry Reid, Bill Clarke and Stewart Lamont, is not a bad newspaper; in fact, it is a rather good one. It reported—I have no reason to doubt Mr. Thomas McConnell's reporting—that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the head teachers gave him a fairly sympathetic hearing."</p></blockquote>
Given that the Minister is a controversial figure in Scotland, I suppose that he will regard that as wild enthusiasm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At that conference the Minister explained to the head teachers their role in life and how his new boards
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0899">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>267</span>
should operate. According to the 	<i>Glasgow Herald,</i> the Minister's view was that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the system had consistently under-estimated the value of the 'commonsense judgments' of lay people."</p></blockquote>
But this morning he told us that the lay people who responded to his paper took a different view to him about the role of head teachers and that they have all now changed their minds, and not even COSLA—I am glad that he regards it as a repository of knowledge on these matters—has sought to have amendments tabled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The newspaper also quotes the Minister as saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"'Most people have a pretty shrewd idea of what they need from a school,' he explained. 'They want to see their children stretched' "—</p></blockquote>
I was wondering whether the Minister was going to introduce some of his more wild ideas into education, but I think that he was referring to academic attainments—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and they want to see wholesome moral and social values respected and promulgated."</p></blockquote>
He must have been to the Free Kirk on Sunday. That is the only conclusion that I can come to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our view is that the headmaster is extremely important to the education authority, parents, children and a healthy school community. The Government are undermining him by not giving him a vote on the board. Unfortunately, far from taking a conciliatory view, the boards may become confrontationist. I readily accept that the Minister does not want that to happen. Headmasters are important and powerful people and I did not dissent from a word of what the right honourable Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) said. His points were wholly valid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the same time, a headmaster is an officer of an authority. The Minister made a powerful point when he said that a headmaster is the authority's person. That was the thrust of his argument. But he was prepared to defend a head teacher who wrote direct to the Prime Minister to involve her in a matter which was the responsibility of a regional authority and the Scottish Education Department. The Minister cannot have it both ways. The headmaster's first loyalty should be to the education authority because that is required of officers of an authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I became a local government officer way back in 1953, the first thing that I was told was that my first loyalty was to the authority. That is the role of any official in local government. That is seriously undermined if a head teacher can write direct to a Minister or, in this instance, the Prime Minister over the head of the authority. It is a deplorable and unprofessional action and the Minister would not subscribe to it if the boot were on the other foot. He would not be impressed by a headmaster writing to me if I were the Minister responsible for education or to my right honourable Friend the Member for Islwyn (Mr. Kinnock) if he were Prime Minister, intervening in a matter that was wholly the responsibility of the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>268</span>
Head teachers' first loyalty is to their authorities. The issue is not in doubt. The Minister is right about it and he should not have two standards—one for Paisley grammar school and one for the rest of the Scottish education system. It is not worthy of him. He is too clear minded for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I shall not give way until I have finished this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first loyalty of a local authority official is to that authority. The Minister has accepted and, indeed, advanced that argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I shall finish this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The action referred to was inappropriate. It would be appropriate for head teachers to have a vote on the boards. Then their role vis-a-vis the authority would not be in doubt. With a full place on the board they could work within the consensus of that board—the very consensus that the Minister says that he wants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman saying that in his judgment there are no circumstances in our democratic system in which a headmaster should write to a Minister of State, the Secretary of State or the Prime Minister?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am saying that any framework of management—a system with which I would expect the hon. Gentleman to be familiar because he frequently tells us of his experience in industry—has a line of management, a line of control and a line of accountability. It would have been appropriate for the head teacher to make his representations to the divisional education officer, who in turn would have referred them to the director of education, but there was no line of communication outside the authority for any official. That arrangement is quite wrong, so I do not accept the hon. Gentleman's argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman keeps using the word "loyalty". We are concerned about responsibilities. The head teacher has certain responsibilities to the education authority and to the board. By introducing the question of loyalty, the hon. Gentleman is seeking to fudge where the head teacher's obligations lie.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If my memory is correct, the head teacher of Paisley grammar school began his letter to the Prime Minister by saying that he was writing at the request of parents to put the school's view, which seems a perfectly reasonable action in the circumstances. The letter is a red herring. The Bill provides for head teachers to meet their responsibilities to the education authority, but that does not mean slavishly doing everything that the authority requires. On the contrary, some aspects of school policy will be a matter for the boards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that perfectly, but I am in no doubt that a headmaster's first responsibility is to the education authority. He is responsible to that authority for the conduct of the school and for the

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>269</span>
discharge of its functions within the terms of the education Acts. He has no responsibility for writing letters on behalf of parents, which is not the role of a head teacher. In my judgment, it was improper and unprofessional for that head teacher to take it upon himself to do that. I repeat my view—and I will not give way on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot allow head teachers or other local government officers—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or civil servants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—or civil servants to proceed to deal directly with the Prime Minister or with Ministers of the Crown when their access to decision making has another and well defined route. If any civil servant, or DHSS office manager, wrote to the Secretary of State for Social Services deploring Government policy or refusing to implement it, he or she would be sacked. And, by Jove, the right honourable Lady the Member for Finchley (Mrs. Thatcher), the Prime Minister, would be the first to see that such people were sacked. Equally, any Minister who has had the audacity to challenge what has been said in Cabinet has been sacked. Any notion that such people would not be sacked is misguided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The logic of the hon. Gentleman's argument is that that head teacher should have been sacked. Is that what he is saying?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I am certainly not saying that. I am saying that it was improper and unprofessional behaviour. I deeply regret that any headmaster put himself in that position. It is not something that I would recommend to other head teachers or something that I or my party would expect head teachers to do. The first responsibility and loyalty of civil servants, or of local government officers, is to their authority. The minute that they become directly involved in policy, we shall be on a slippery road. Democracy itself will be undermined if officials take over.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arnold</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with interest to the arguments of the past two or three minutes.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Gravesham makes my point for me. Had the school board been in existence—or the school council—it could have written to any party it wished. What I find improper is that a head teacher wrote to the Prime Minister. I do not want to go through all the arguments again. All the points have been made and you were right to bring the Committee to order, Mr. Knox. The issue was raised to reinforce our view that the head teacher is an important person vis-à-vis the authority, who has responsibilities and loyalties to the authority. Equally, he has responsibility to the parents and to the school community as a whole. That can best be exercised on the board, if the head teacher is regarded as a full member, equal to other members of the board. That is why we shall press the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the amendments is to remove from the Bill the right to make regulations, although I readily accept that that would not be a tenable position on its own. I know that the Minister is struggling to hear me against the excellent advice that he is receiving from the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker), but I have tabled the amendments to demonstrate to him my view that instead of providing for regulations, the Bill should specify clearly the numbers of parents, staff and co-opted members that will apply and the different provision that is to be made for different schools and different classes of school. The Bill could contain a tidy formula for that and the need for regulations would not arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister and I will do battle on many future occasions over various Bills that will come before the House during the next three years. I do not like the device of stating that the Government will bring forward regulations and what the regulations will specify. I should much prefer the primary legislation to embody precisely and clearly what the statute is. The decision to make regulations on such important matters does not allow for that. Curiously enough, the Minister, who is not the most coy of Ministers in Her Majesty's
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0901">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>271</span>
Governmenl—has told us precisely how he envisages teachers will be represented on boards. We shall say more about that. The right honourable Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) talks a lot of sense on these matters and he said earlier that he was unhappy about the formula that had been devised for the number of teachers who would serve on boards. So am I, and I hope that the Minister will take a more flexible view and we can discuss the matter again in a way that will enable us to arrive at a different formula that will enjoy greater support from the teaching profession in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have two questions. First, why are there regulations instead of simply providing for composition in the Bill? Secondly, why have the Government said what they will do with teachers but not with anyone else, although we know, of course, what the maximum number for a board will be? I hope that the Minister will answer those questions. The amendments are not intended to be adversarial; they have been tabled to get information from the Minister and to alert him to our disquiet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister asked whether this was the best time to debate all the regulations and the composition of the members of the board. Frankly, like my hon. Friend the Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg), I believe that the numbers should be specified in the Bill. I am perplexed when I read about the composition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the regulations, the boards of schools with between 501 and 1,000 pupils—more than 90 per cent of secondary schools in Strathclyde region are in that category—will consist of five parents, three co-opted members and one solitary staff member. That ratio of eight to one is an insult to the teaching profession in Scotland. How can the Minister possibly consider having such an imbalance in the makeup of the boards of those secondary schools? Does he not realise that it is only through cooperation and partnership between teachers and parents that Scottish education has advanced? A ratio of eight to one represents retardation in education and it is an insult to good staff members who have put a lot into their profession and into the local community. Each school is a credit and a focal point to its local community and the teaching staff and the representatives make a great impression on that community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should accept that schools have a wider purpose. They are involved in the community. Indeed, it is incumbent upon them to be involved in it. How can they do that if there is merely a token member of staff on school boards? Regulations are not the proper way to specify who should be on the board and these are simply provocative. In the past, the Minister said that he would listen to people. In the consultative process, an overwhelming number of representations from parents showed that they wanted staff to be involved and that they did not want a small number of parents to run schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much has already been said about Paisley grammar school. In a letter to the 	<i>Glasgow Herald</i> on 6 April, the head teacher of Jordanhill school, Mr. Cram, said that one parent could not wait until school boards were
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>272</span>
introduced so that every child could read the same books. That has nothing to do with education. In some schools in Belfast, books such as "Kes" have been banned by parent members. I realise, Mr. Knox, that I am skating on the periphery of being out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman is already through the ice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Six minutes to go.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have some support coming up in the rear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations are provocative and there is no excuse for having just one solitary teacher on the board of secondary schools. Will the Minister take that point seriously?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am the support for which my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) was looking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends have referred to the composition of the board, which is detailed in the suggested regulations. The board must reflect new thinking, and obviously will be composed of parent members, staff members and co-opted members. How were the figures arrived at? How did the Minister decide the number of parent members for a particular size of school? During the consultations, anxiety was expressed about unrepresentative minorities taking over the functions of the school board, and having a disproportionate effect on matters such as the type of reading material used, as my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must put into context the remarks of the right honourable Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) who said that we are not considering only the consultative role of board members, but the evolutionary role which will take them into executive management of schools. It is possible that the Government have disclosed, either in consultative papers or in news briefings, the reasons for their choosing those particular compositions. I accept that the board must be small enough to be manageable and to discharge its responsibilites under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton referred to the imbalance between parent members and staff members, especially in schools with 501 to 1,000 pupils. There are a large number of schools in that category in Strathclyde. The same may apply to many Scottish education authorities. The proportion of five to one is probably the worst example in the regulations; in the one to 500 band, which particularly affects primary schools, the ratio is four to one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that a co-opted member is defined as a member who is co-opted. Who are the co-opted members likely to be? That would have a bearing on the type of expertise that they will contribute to the work of school boards and show whether co-opted members would give a better balance to parent and staff members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's enthusiasm for ensuring a parental majority is something that we can accept or not, but that is not the point of issue here, which is to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0902">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>273</span>
ensure that boards reflect a proper balance between parental involvement and the professional excellence and expertise in the school. For that reason, the role of the co-opted members may be crucial. If we are to legislate for voting rights on boards, it is naive of the Government to think that the rights will not be exercised at some time, especially when we move from floor to ceiling, and from ceiling to an opt-out position in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my remarks will be reinforced by our previous debate about the exclusion of the head teacher from what we think would have been a valuable voting role on the school board. We should like the Minister to reply to those questions and also to tell us why those figures were chosen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg) said, his amendment sought to substitute a provision written into the Bill for the prescription of board composition by regulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>274</span>
I am prepared to think about it, but we chose deliberately to use regulations so as to ensure that the detailed structure of membership could be altered easily in the light of experience of the operation of the boards. Changes that are considered desirable may apply to particular categories of school—for example, special schools. I need not tell members of the Committee how time consuming and tedious it would be to make such changes through primary legislation.
