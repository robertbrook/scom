	<br><blockquote><p>'(h) funding, providing, and assisting in the provision of a programme to eliminate and prevent the problems of dampness and condensation within the housing stock.'.</p></blockquote>
I welcome you to the Committee, Mr. Lambie, on behalf of all members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We come to one of the most lamentable areas of the Government's custodianship—the presiding over a cut in spending on the eradication of dampness and condensation. It is not as though they are ignorant of the scale of the problem. The 1984 report by the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs, "Dampness in Housing", which was honoured by your chairmanship, Mr. Lambie, examined the plague of dampness in Scotland in detail and concluded that the information available was inadequate, that arrangements for collecting statistics and data on dampness were inadequate and that the collection of the data was unnecessarily complicated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No less an authority than the honourable Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton), now the Minister responsible for housing, grilled the honourable Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart), the Minister responsible for housing at that time, about those deficiencies. He asked:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Is the Minister aware that there is a very strong feeling that this allocation"—</p></blockquote>
the allocation for spending on dampness—
	<br><blockquote><p>"has not been made on an objective assessment on the basis of need"?</p></blockquote>
At the time the Government were saying that only so much money could be spent, but the present Under Secretary of State questioned the basis on which they would decide how to cut the cake. He went on to ask:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Is the Minister aware that, on the basis of an objective assessment, the feeling is that these figures bear no relation to the needs of the situation, as the Committee saw when we visited Edinburgh?"</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is an interesting reversal of roles in this Committee.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>220</span>
Whereas at that time the honourable Member Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) was the Minister trying to defend the indefensible and the honourable Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) was speaking up for his constituents in Edinburgh, now it is apparently to be the other way round. We look forward to hearing some vicious attacks by the honourable Member for Eastwood on his honourable Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The irony of the situation has not escaped members of the Committee, but it would be nice if the present Minister would have the courage of his convictions and continue in the same vein as he did as a member of the Scottish Affairs Committee, when he was so critical of Government policy. His criticism at that time may have been intended to portray him as the human face of Conservatism, as only half the Conservative Members on the Select Committee were re-elected at the subsequent general election and four of them are now somewhere out in the political wilderness. There is a lesson there for the current Minister, who seems to have switched horses from being apparently on the side of tenants and owner-occupiers suffering from dampness to supporting the Government bureaucracy and the Treasury.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Galloway 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Hillhead)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my honourable Friend is suggesting that the present Minister is a "damp" or even a "wet", I am not sure that that will do the Minister's career much good.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: His impact has been that of a damp squib, although we had thought that he might bring some innovative thinking to this scene. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I jest not, Mr. Lambie.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Scotland (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the honourable Gentleman accept that the Select Committee report on dampness had an effect and that there was a substantial increase in resources for that purpose after the report?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, and I will give the Minister proof to the contrary. Edinburgh has a massive dampness problem with more than 16,000 houses badly affected by dampness in one form or another. The Government were asked for help. Councillors first went 400 yards to the Scottish Office, but received no extra allocation for the problem. They then came 400 miles to London to ask for some extra capital allocation to tackle dampnes, but received no help. Eventually, they had to go twice 4,000 miles to the Industrial Bank of Japan for a covenant scheme to finance much of the work being done on dampness in the Minister's own constituency, in that of the Secretary of State and throughout the city.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's hands are not clean in this respect and the Scottish Development Department returns show that the position is growing worse. This year will see a disgraceful drop in the amount of money that councils have available to combat dampness. According to the Government's figures, the figure is dropping from £78 million last year to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0201">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>221</span>
£69,500,000 in the coming financial year and will be about £70 million by 1991–92. Does the Minister accept that that is a disgrace? We are presiding over a decline in spending on dampness when, if anything, there is plenty of evidence that the amount of dampness is increasing as post-war system-built houses continue to deteriorate due to the Government's neglect in underfunding councils to tackle the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The private sector has its problems, too, in relation to dampness. The Secretary of State told the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs that it was primarily a matter for private sector owners to identify and take steps to remedy problems of dampness and condensation in their houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a sad and disgraceful attitude towards some of the most elderly and vulnerable tenants in Scotland. The amendment would give the Government agency the primary legal responsibility to enforce an effective anti-dampness programme on uncaring landlords registered with Scottish Homes and to plan and fund the eradication of dampness in other Scottish housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures to which I have referred were produced in 1984. They have been updated and there have been a number of studies to estimate the number of damp houses, lest we be accused of using out-of-date figures. The Government's own labour force survey, carried out two years after the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs reported, estimated that a staggering one in four Scottish homes is affected by dampness. Of those half a million homes, 370,000 are in the public sector, more than 100,000 are owner occupied and 49,000 are privately rented. In many of those properties there is not merely mild condensation, which may be offensive, but severe dampness, which probably affects 160,000 houses in Scotland. Nearly half a million people have been consigned to what would have been a disgrace in the 19th century, let alone the 20th.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the leader of the Opposition visited Burdiehouse drive in my constituency with me at the weekend, we were in streets where families have suffered from the effects of dampness. In Burdiehouse, and Southhouse, as in other parts of the capital and in towns and villages throughout Scotland, many homes are affected by dampness. Members who visit their constituents regularly in Edinburgh and in other parts of Scotland recognise the symptoms as soon as they reach many of the thresholds. A sickly sweet smell of rotting furnishings permeates the air. I have been taken into many flats where dampness has destroyed carpets, wardrobes, beds and bedding. Drawers have been opened to reveal clothing rotting inside them. In the past, I and my honourable Friends helped people to obtain the small grants available from the DHSS to help with the replacement of such items, and it is a matter of deep sadness that those grants have been all but abolished. It is a disgrace that for many families on the breadline there is now no Government help available for such items.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Items of furniture and clothing can be replaced, but the lungs of the children who live in those houses cannot be replaced, and there is conclusive proof that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>222</span>
dampness is making people ill. In 1986 Edinburgh university researchers completed a study on housing and health on a housing estate in Edinburgh which, like so many other housing estates, is badly affected by damp. The study found clear effects of damp on children's health. Respiratory bronchial symptoms, particularly, were far more common among children living in damp houses. Headaches, diarrhoea and other aches and pains were also much more frequently recorded for children in damp houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The authors of that study are much respected in their fields—Sonia Hunt, Claudia Martin and Stephen Piatt—are highly respected in their field. They go into the problems in horrific detail. They found that damp houses often breed mould fungi which emit mycotoxins, polluting the environment, settling on bedding and even food. Exposure to this can exacerbate asthma, bronchitis and alveolitis. A different mould, which grows on the walls of damp houses, has been found responsible for serious damage to internal organs after contaminating food. This affects not just a few people but an estimated 120,000 Scottish children whose health is at serious risk from damage because they live in very damp houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What do the Government intend to do about this? The spending plans, as I have said, reveal a drop over the next four years from £78 million in 1987 to less than £70 million in 1988 and to only £70 million by 1992. How can the Government contemplate spending less on this tragic problem in 1988 than in 1987 and 1986? Even if they are oblivious to the human suffering, they will be concerned about the property, a matter about which their class has always been concerned, so they will want to take steps to ensure that the cost of eradicating dampness is met now rather than having to meet a far higher cost in future. That is the nub of the problem. The Government have consistently failed both to assess the resources required to tackle dampness and to heed those who have warned about the damaging effects on people living in damp houses, especially children. They have failed to assess the scale of the problem and to programme the resources required to meet it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The evidence of the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs has been ignored. The 1986 SDD dampness survey was ignored. The independent study of housing and health by Edinburgh university also seems to have been ignored. We now have the 1987 housing checklist returns from the 56 Scottish local authorities, but the Government seem unwilling to step in to ensure that proper planning and funding are provided. Instead of attacking the problem, the Government have withdrawn the resources, and the special allowances for help in heating damp houses have just been abolished. Amendment No. 51 seeks to provide a realistic approach to the problems of damp houses, placing responsibility for co-ordinating the planning to tackle dampness firmly on a Government agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister served on the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs he was not content to bury his
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0202">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>223</span>
head in the sand as he appears to do now—he wanted the critical and vigorous approach of Government policies at that time. We ask him to continue such an approach to ensure that dampness is firmly tackled within a reasonable time scale. In terms of planning, that should be within five years. As one who is concerned about housing, it sticks in my throat that we have to set a time scale which will condemn many people to live in damp houses for five or more years, but we recognise that we are committing the Government to a major reversal of policy on spending on housing and on tackling dampness. To do that we must persuade them to accept our amendment and give them a reasonable time scale to achieve the results we want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Shelter has described living in damp conditions and dampness itself as not just "a minor inconvenience" but "a major social evil." That is no overstatement of the case. We want the new agency—if it is set up—to have a remit to get to grips with the problems faced by authorities dealing with damp houses and by private landlords whose tenants suffer the effects of dampness. In particular, it should seek to deal with the problems of people living in houses which are now labelled as a health hazard, something that many of us have suspected for a long time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the amendment gives the Government a chance to get to grips once and for all with one of the severest problems affecting our country as well as our housing today. This has been highlighted in a number of independent reports. The inquiry into housing in Glasgow specifically recommended a course of action similar to the one that I am advocating. Professor Grieve proposed that a technical appraisal should be commissioned for each house type to determine the most cost-effective heat and insulation system. He said that the appraisal should weigh the cost of house improvements against replacement costs and should be completed within 18 months to form the basis of a city-wide strategy. That was more than 18 months ago. Glasgow has not been given the resources to carry out that appraisal, and it would have been selfish if the Grieve report had suggested that only Glasgow should benefit from such excellent advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As far as I know, the Government have done nothing to carry out that appraisal. I do not wish to go over the arguments for the house condition survey which we went into in some depth last week. But I note the strong support that the Minister appeared to give when he was questioning the honourable Member for Eastwood during proceedings in the Select Committeee on Scottish Affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He seemed to impress on his honourable Friend the need for a house condition survey, or certainly an assessment of properties. That was in 1984. Two years later the Grieve committee met and finally concluded that an appraisal of the housing stock was needed. Only in that way can we be sure that the Government in their capital allocations to local authorities are spending the money well and are not repeating the mistakes of the past. Those mistakes were well documented in the inquiries into housing in Glasgow, Edinburgh and Stirling and in the many excellent reports produced by Scottish local
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>224</span>
authorities, including the recent Renfrew report, which I understand was sent to the Minister over the weekend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We back up every word that Grieve says about the need to appraise the state of housing in Glasgow and in Scotland and we fully endorse the need to appraise the housing stock, in line with the needs of housing investment, for dampness and other problems. There is no point in spending money on refurbishing blocks which would be better demolished, but at present councils have no choice but to undertake costly refurbishment programmes because the cost of demolition and rebuilding would be much greater.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that the Government would like to avoid not only the cost implications but the implications of having to carry out an appraisal which would embarrass them. That must be set aside in the interests of an effective housing policy and of effectively remedying the problems that we see in our daily lives as Members of Parliament representing those who have to live in such properties. We all know of those problems. It is not open to all of us to have the Boundary Commissions take out of our constituencies houses that we have visited and condemned but no longer represent and, sadly, no longer seem to care about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that the Minister responsible for housing visited the Pilton scheme and saw the problems there. The surprising thing about Pilton for the Government is that, despite a massive investment of public money by a Conservative Administration to subsidise private property developers, the houses that they have refurbished are now in a worse condition than adjacent houses which have been refurbished by the district council. Dampness is now manifesting itself in the homes in west Pilton for which so much money was poured into private developers' pockets. The Government stood by then; I should like to say "on the sidelines", but they encouraged that money to go in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why an appraisal is needed. It is to make sure that whoever is upgrading houses will do so to proper standards and will not indulge in the sort of jerrybuilding which too often went on in Pilton as recently as four years ago and which is now throwing up problems. Either the district council will have to take over those houses to eradicate damp and condensation or the Government will have to give large repair grants to tackle the problems that were not tackled by the Conservatives in what was merely an exercise to throw money at developers. The matter was not of concern to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, if the amendment is not accepted, we might as well hold another Scottish Affairs Select Committee on dampness, take the same weighty evidence and ignore it, too. That is virtually what has happened since 1984, and the Opposition do not wish to see that happen again. We want to see effective action taken to appraise the problems in our houses and to ensure that dampness, the scourge of the 20th century, is eradicated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude my remarks there and hope that the Minister will find it in his brief to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

My honourable Friend concluded by saying that we could have a further investigation by the Scottish Affairs Select Committee on the subject, but he is wrong. That cannot be done. There is no Select Committee on Scottish Affairs because Conservative Members refuse to serve on such a Committee. They are prepared to sit in a Committee that is bouncing unwelcome legislation to bear on the lives of people in Scotland, but they are not interested in sitting on a Committee that can bring out information and make practical recommendations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
My honourable Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South misquoted Shelter. He referred to the fact that
	<br><blockquote><p>"damp living conditions are not merely a minor inconvenience for those who have to endure them; they constitute a major social evil."</p></blockquote>
Shelter referred to that, but it comes from the first recommendation of the 1983 Select Committee on Scottish Affairs. How appropriate, Mr. Lambie, that you, I and the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, the honourable Member for Edinburgh, West
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>226</span>
are gathered here together talking about dampness in housing in Scotland. Obviously, you cannot talk about it, Mr. Lambie, and I have no doubt that you are acting as a completely impartial Chairman, as you did at that time. But how well we all recall travelling round different parts of Scotland looking at housing conditions, principally in the public sector, but also in the private sector, and meeting experts who could advise us on how best to deal with the problem—people from the building research establishment in East Kilbride and from housing authorities up and down Scotland, and, indeed, the tenants living in those difficult conditions. At that time there was a degree of unanimity in the Committee that this was a social evil. That report was passed unanimously and presumably signed by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, the honourable Member for Edinburgh, West along with the rest of us, and it recommended action that could and should be taken in order to deal with that social evil.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no getting away from the fact that it is a social evil. None of us would like to live in housing conditions in which the walls are continually running with dampness. Dampness is a complicated, technical subject. Dampness comes in a multitude of different forms: it can be penetrating damp, rising damp or condensation. But they have a basic common denominator: they are all wet. running down the walls of houses, in bedrooms, sitting rooms and any other parts of a house affects the soft furnishings and causes clothes to decay. It causes mould, and fungal spores circulate in the atmosphere. As my honourable Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South said, that gives rise to diseases, especially among young people and the very old. It is a serious problem that affects not only the property of citizens, but also their health and future. A responsible Government should be concerned about that.

There is a multitude of ways in which it should be possible for Scottish Homes, housing authorities and other bodies to approach this difficulty. There is the matter of construction techniques and bad design. Clearly it will be expensive and difficult to cure the defects in existing buildings, but it is no good to try to pull the wool over our eyes and pretend that the problems do not exist. They will not go away, but will get worse if nothing is done. The Government should look at defective buildings and consider how to help tenants and householders make their homes more habitable. It will cost money. The homes may require insulation, different heating systems and alterations as well as repairs. If that needs to be done, so be it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Condensation is often said to be different from other forms of dampness. As I said earlier, all dampness is wet and bad. It is not unheard of for landlords, in both the public and private sectors, to say to tenants who complain of dampness that it is their fault and has to do with their lifestyle: they should not boil kettles, run baths or even breathe, but turn up their heating, regardless of expense, open all the windows and put on fans to blow away the

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>227</span>
dampness. It is offensive, insulting and grossly unreasonable to make such statements to tenants who are often on low incomes and cannot afford expensive heating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My honourable Friend referred to the Select Committee's visit to Pilton, part of which was then in the constituency of the honourable Member for Edinburgh, West. I remember him going round wringing his hands, saying how appalling it was and that something should be done. One of the problems in Pilton was that many of the buildings had been constructed with built-in, electric central heating. If it were switched on full blast, it would have cured the dampness, but would have bankrupted most of the tenants. They could not afford it; moreover it was inefficient.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my honourable Friend aware that it is not unusual in Edinburgh for tenants with expensive heating systems—even storage heaters installed as late as 1973—to have bills of £300 to £350 to keep the house tolerably warm? When one visits such houses, some rooms are cold. Not only have the houses inadequate heating systems, but because there is almost no insulation, they are almost impossible to heat. Bills of £350 are not uncommon, and the people who pay them are in work. Indeed, generally two members of the family are in work and their earning power is adequate to meet them. They have to heat the outside of the building and the stairs because of the insulation problems. Some of their neighbours get a little of that heat as it seeps through, but because they are on supplementary benefit and the Government have abolished heating additions for the elderly and for those who receive attendance and disability allowances, it is almost impossible for many people to heat their homes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My honourable Friend is absolutely right. This illustrates the case for an in-depth study into the causes of dampness, the means of overcoming it and the co-ordination of Government policy in relation to that aspect of people's living conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In clause 1 we are considering not only the construction and tenure of houses, but other ways in which Government policy can bear on people's living conditions, such as the cost of energy and the level of support available to those on low incomes to heat their homes. These are the areas where a study of dampness, and the Government policy relating to it, could help to ensure that those considerations are taken into account by the Scottish Office and the other Departments of state—the DHSS, the Department of Energy and others—which have related responsibilities. This is one of the things that the Select Committee suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall pick up a few points from the report of the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs. It is an extremely well-drafted report and much in it bears repeating. One of the minor, timid recommendations in paragraph 4 of the summary of conclusions and recommendations is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We propose that a small-scale pilot study be carried out to assess the need for a comprehensive survey and work out the techniques and methodology that might be used in such a survey."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>228</span>
That could be described as talks about talks; they propose that there should be a small-scale pilot study to see whether a major study would be worth undertaking. Nothing could be more moderate and reasonable than that. I ask the Minister whether such a pilot study was ever carried out; so far as I know, it was not. That was one of the more timid suggestions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 76 of the report refers to a "Dampness Task Force". It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"What we have in mind might be described as a 'Dampness Task Force', set up in acknowledgement of the fact that the current spread of dampness problems constitutes something approaching a national emergency. As in the aftermath of a natural disaster, so in the present situation regarding dampness (the analogy is not in our opinion over-stretched), there is a need for a single body which can offer expertise and advice, and co-ordinate the work of those directly responsible for remedial efforts."</p></blockquote>
The report refers to "a national emergency" and says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The analogy is not in our opinion over-stretched".</p></blockquote>
I do not remember the honourable Member for Edinburgh, West moving an amendment to that part of the draft, so I presume that he must have accepted at that stage that it was a national emergency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With regard to the Select Committee report, most of the investigation was done before the election, over some months. The final report was published after the election, when I was no longer a member of the Selcect Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He changed his mind when they gave him a job.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is trying to distance himself from the report, which is based on the evidence collected and the general thrust of thinking of members of the Committee, including the honourable Member. I have been reading through the minutes of evidence relating to the time when the Minister was a member of the Select Committee. Practically every witness who came before us was politely asked by the honourable Member for Edinburgh, West whether he or she thought it would be useful, in the context of the dampness crisis in Scotland, to have a comprehensive house condition survey.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise, Mr. Lambie, that I must not get back to that subject, which has already been debated, but it is connected with the dampness crisis in Scotland. At that time, the honourable Member for Edinburgh, West was the foremost protagonist of the case for a house condition survey because he recognised that there was a problem which needed to be analysed in some detail and that a comprehensive strategy needed to be developed to overcome the problem. But here we are, five years later; he is now supposed to be the Minister in charge of co-ordinating housing policy in Scotland. He could have the power to do something about the evils which he identified at that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question that must be asked is this: "Who is determining housing policy in Scotland today?" Is it the honourable Member for Edinburgh, West who displayed signs of dampness in the past and who demonstrated that he cared about the circumstances
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0205">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>229</span>
in which his constituents were living? Or is he being leant on by some of the more sinster forces determining policy in Scotland today? Last week, we saw an example of that in relation to education, when the Secretary of State for Scotland was overruled by the Under-Secretary of State, the honourable Member for Stirling. One wonders whether the honourable Member for Stirling and the extreme Right-wing minority faction—a minority within a minority in the Conservative party in Scotland—are the people who are calling the shots in Scotland today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why I suspect that we shall hear the honourable Member for Edinburgh, West despite everything that he has said in the past and all the concern that he has expressed, reading out a brief headed "Resist" and saying why he has been told to say that it is all unnecessary and the responsibility of local authorities and that the Government must not interfere we saw examples of Government interference in local authorities last week when it suited them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here is a case of the people of Scotland crying out for action to deal with a crisis that is afflicting the lives of about half a million people living in damp conditions. That is an area in which the Committee could improve the framework of legislation and ensure that the new agency that the Government wish to set up gets to grips with some of the real problems of people in Scotland, instead of concentrating on peripheral issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may not be surprising that the Minister wishes to dissociate himself from some of the people with whom he served on that Committee, especially Messrs McQuarrie, Henderson, Mrs. McCurley and Hirst Henderson, Mrs. McCurley and Hirst, who are no longer with us. Today Conservative Members appear to be dissociating themselves from the Minister by thier absence including the honourable Members for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) and for Dumfries (Sir H. Munro). The Government are at sixes and sevens because of what they said in 1983–84 to the Select Committee. Honourable Members could say what they did from the Back Benches, but now that they are on the Front Bench they have changed their tune. Can we expect the same from Conservative Back-Bench Members?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My honourable Friend must not tempt providence. It is a great relief to me that Messrs McQuarrie, Ancram, Malone, Corrie, Fraser, Hirst, Henderson, Pollock, MacKay and Fletcher and Mrs. McCurley are no longer with us. I look forward to the day when the few Conservative Members who survived will join them in oblivion in Scotland, because that is the way that they are going. If they continue to inflict legislation on and apply methods of administration to the people of Scotland that are palpably wrong and oppressive, they will have to face the music. I do not know why the honourable Member for Stirling is leering; he has one of the smallest majorities of all. He should have gone last time and he is living on borrowed time. He has about
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>230</span>
another three years if he is lucky.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The background to the Bill is the Government's posturing about the need to improve the quality and choice of housing for tenants and other householders in Scotland. There can be unanimity in the Committee and elsewhere about the case for improving quality and choice. But a fraudulent prospectus has been put before the Committee, and the amendment gives us an ideal and graphic opportunity to discuss something that really matters to tenants and householders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a case for diversifying tenure and improving choice and quality, but what could be more funadamental, when we discuss the quality of people's housing, than dampness and condensation? For a householder in Scotland to know that his house is free of dampness and condensation and that he has no dangers associated with fungal infestation is probably a more significant part of the quality of his environment than whether the can have a new front door. Are we talking about superficial aspects of housing quality or fundamental issues? Hope springs eternal, and I hope that the Minister will give a positive or sympathetic reply. It is within his power to do something about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are calling for Scottish Homes to be given a fundamental function of
	<br><blockquote><p>"funding, providing, and assisting in the provision of a programme to eliminate and prevent the problems of dampness and condensation within the housing stock"</p></blockquote>
in Scotland. That could be done. The Government could and should ensure that the new housing agency does that job and has the wherewithal to do so, but I fear that the evidence of our previous debate shows that the Government prefer to be ignorant about the problems and to conceal their nature. In the debate about the house condition survey it became graphically clear that the Government do not have a clue how many houses are below the tolerable standard in Scotland and, more alarmingly, do not want to know. They prefer to obscure the issue. I hope that that is not the case in relation to dampness, too, but the Minister will have an opportunity to reply in a minute or two.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I notice that the Committee is graced this morning with the presence of four Ministers, for which I suppose we should be thankful, as they rarely attend in such numbers.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>231</span>
We are dealing with a serious problem which the Government refuse to recognise. If one looks at all the documents that the Government have brought out in advance of the Bill—for example, the White Paper on Scottish housing—one finds no reference to the problem of dampness and condensation. There are some elliptical references. For example, in the consultative document we are told:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Although the number of houses exceeds the number of households requiring them, it is manifestly clear that many, especially in the rented sector, are below the standards considered satisfactory today".</p></blockquote>
The consultative document does not spell out what is meant by the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"below the standards considered satisfactory today",</p></blockquote>
but I assume that, even in the obtuse manner, the Government are conceding that the problem of condensation and dampness exists in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, the White Paper refers to some areas of public sector housing in Scotland where
	<br><blockquote><p>"there are major problems of unsuitable house types, disrepair and management".</p></blockquote>
Again the Government cannot bring themselves to use the words "dampness and condensation", but I hope that they are referring to that problem in particular. Paragraph 1.16 of the White Paper says that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the condition of much of the housing stock is good."</p></blockquote>
That implies that the condition of parts of the housing stock are not good. Therefore, the Government are hinting that there is a problem, but they cannot bring themselves to say that a major problem of dampness and condensation exists in the housing stock in Scotland. If they listen to those who are involved with housing in Scotland, they will realise that there is a severe crisis of condensation and dampness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether the Minister went to the Scottish homes and jobs conference held in March last year, which was attended by local authorities, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, tenants' groups, voluntary bodies such as Shelter and bodies such as the Fraser of Allander Institute. If any Government Members had gone to the conference, they would have heard Shelter say that more than 520,000 Scottish homes are affected by dampness and that the health of 120,000 Scottish children is at serious risk because their homes are severely damp.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Lambie. The Secretary of State and the Minister responsible for health may not be concerned about this problem, and may be happy to chat and laugh, but some of us cannot hear my honourable Friend make his valuable contribution. Will you ask the Secretary of State either to leave the Committee if he is not interested or to remain silent so that at least he will learn something?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take it for granted that the Ministers are discussing the arguments that they will make later in our proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, Mr. Lambie, for your interpretation of the Ministers' conversation. The only contribution that either Minister has made to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>232</span>
the debate was when the Secretary of State for Scotland shouted from a sedentary position "Grow up" to my honourable Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson). Other than that, the two of them have remained silent, as I imagine they will continue to do throughout our consideration of the Bill. They have no answers to the many problems that have been asked repeatedly by Opposition Members; they seem incapable of responding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred to Shelter's estimate of more than 500,000 homes in Scotland that are affected by damp and condensation and the Government's failure to recognise it. Shelter considers that those 500,000 homes make a large contribution to the estimate by the Scottish homes and jobs conference that there is an immediate need for £400 million to be invested to begin to repair the council housing stock in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A table in that conference report shows the major repairs that are required to local authority housing. Under the heading "Dampness", it is estimated that 68,680 houses require remedial work at a cost of £1,700 per house. That is a total cost of £167 million to solve the problem of dampness in Scotland's housing stock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the work required to overcome condensation, 240,019 houses in Scotland require remedial work at a cost of £1,300 per house, giving a total of £312 million. Almost £500 million is required, according to the estimate of that important conference, to deal with the problems of condensation and dampness in Scotland's housing stock. That sort of money is not forthcoming from the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not only a matter of national statistics. The Minister should know that Dundee district council, when it drew up its 1985 housing plan, had a close look at the nearly 40,000 houses under its control. It produced the pamphlet that has been passed to the Minister entitled "Dundee's Housing Crisis". It gives a detailed account of the work that needs to be done at local level to overcome the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second page of the document states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Each home needs a heating system which provides a good level of heat throughout the house and at a reasonable cost, but that less than one fifth of the Council's housing stock has adequate heating systems."</p></blockquote>
Less than one fifth of 40,000 houses in Dundee have adequate heating systems and require new heating systems. The report continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"To keep heating costs down and to help prevent condensation, insulation is required. Although the Council has initiated a variety of heating and insulation programmes, there are still 10,000 houses with poor thermal insulation. Progress in this area is inadequate."</p></blockquote>
Four fifths of the housing stock in Dundee is not properly heated or insulated. The council has had to take on the burden of doing something about it when it is starved of investment cash.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the next page the problem of dampness is highlighted. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"17,000 Council houses (40% of the stock)"—</p></blockquote>
almost half—
	<br><blockquote><p>"suffer from dampness and/or condensation. Problems range from small areas of mould growth and difficulties in heating rooms, to extensive mould growth and unhealthy living conditions."</p></blockquote>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My honourable Friend makes a fair point. The only contributions from the Conservative Back Benches have been from honourable Members who represent Scottish constituencies and have an interest in Scottish affairs. The same could not be said for the Government Whip and for the honourable Member for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Arbuthnot), who is here to make up numbers and to vote through a Bill that they scarcely understand. They are simply here, as my honourable Friend said, as lobby-fodder, to force the Bill through and to impose on the Scottish people new housing regulations which three out of every four Scottish voters have utterly rejected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To come back to dampness, Dundee district council says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Dealing with dampness and condensation is one of the Council's biggest headaches. The Council is trying to tackle these problems but is unable to spend anything like the amount of money required. As a result, unsatisfactory living conditions will continue for many tenants, and in some cases worsen."</p></blockquote>
That is something that the Minister will have to recognise: there is a severe problem of dampness and condensation throughout Scotland's housing stock. People are being made to live in not only unsatisfactory conditions but dangerous conditions which affect their health and that of their children. The Minister must take that on board and do something about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One factor which contributes to dampness and condensation and to the problems of keeping one's
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>234</span>
home warm is inadequate windows. The council goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Half the Council's stock has windows which require to be replaced."</p></blockquote>
That means that 20,000 windows in the public sector across Dundee need replacing now, and the council does not have the money to do it. It goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Windows in some houses built in the 1950s and 1960s are worse than those in pre-war houses. In Mill O'Mains, the situation is so bad that every window in the estate is having to be replaced, at a cost of £2 million."</p></blockquote>
Mill O'Mains was built in the 1950s and 1960s. Therefore, there is a severe problem in Dundee, which the council must tackle with the available resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The district council says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"At present the Council is allowed to spend about £10 million per year on major repairs and improvements. By comparison, it is estimated in the Housing Plan that an investment of £50 million per year is required to make the following reasonable and much needed improvements in Dundee's Council housing sector."</p></blockquote>
It is speaking about full modernisation, new building and conversion for sheltered accommodation, major repairs, improvements to heating and insulation and the building of 600 new houses a year for the many thousands of people who are on the council's waiting lists.
	<br><blockquote><p>"has put its case to the Government for a substantial increase on its current capital allocation for investment in the Council housing sector of £10 million per year."</p></blockquote>
The council knows that it needs £50 million a year, but it has only £10 million to spend on major repairs and improvements. What has been the Government's reaction? As I have already said in the Committee, far from increasing the capital allocation to Dundee district council, next year the Government intend to decrease it. That shows the utter contempt which the Government and their Ministers have for the problem of condensation and dampness which affects so many of my constituents in Dundee. Not only the interests of my constituents, of local authorities or of Scotland in general are involved. It is in the Government's interests to begin to tackle the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The briefing which Shelter issued to members of the Committee states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Damp living conditions are not merely a minor housing problem, but serve to render otherwise perfectly decent homes unfit for human habitation, and have a catastrophic effect on both repair and maintenance costs and on the expected life-span of housing."</p></blockquote>
If nothing is done to tackle condensation and dampness, the lifespan of the housing stock will be gravely shortened, leading to even greater costs for the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer the Minister to the position in the Gorbals in Glasgow. I think it was in the Hutchesontown E development. Thousands of houses which had been built only 15 years previously had to be demolished because nothing was done to resolve their severe dampness problem, forcing Glasgow district council to remove the tenants from their houses, abandon the houses for years on end and eventually to agree with the Government to demolish them.

It makes no economic sense to ignore problems of dampness and condensation, to allow the housing stock to deteriorate and then to demolish it at tremendous cost to the public purse. The Scottish homes and jobs conference said that tackling the housing crisis and the dampness problem will have a knock-on effect on unemployment in Scotland. It calculated that for every £1 that the Government invest in the housing stock in Scotland, they would get 50p back. That is because people could be taken off the dole to work in the construction industry tackling the problems of condensation and dampness, rather than drawing unemployment and social security benefit, and paying no income tax. The companies that could employ them are not making sufficient profits to justify paying corporation tax. The net effect of taking people off the dole and putting them to work to solve the problems of dampness and condensation would be to save the Government money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my honourable Friend aware that in various parts of Scotland voluntary organisations and local authorities are co-operaitng to take advantage of Manpower Services Commission schemes, creating jobs by insulating people's homes. The East Lothian insulating project, previously the Musselburgh insulation project, is sponsored by Shelter, with support from East Lothian district council. That project has been taking on unemployed people to go round insulting elderly people's homes. That is being done under the auspices of the scheme, but how much better it would be if local authorities had the resources to enable them to take on regular staff, and employ regular contractors, to do the work properly rather than on a stopgap basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My honourable Friend makes a good point.

Through MSC schemes and through the co-operation of Dundee district council, it is helping to insulate elderly people's homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government fail to recognise the extent of the problem and to fund the necessary expenditure to solve it. It all goes back to definition. In their consultative document on Scottish Homes, the Government claimed that since 1979 they have helped to reduce the number of houses below standard in the private sector from 121,000 to 57,000 in 1986. We had a debate on that in a previous Committee sitting. The Minister got his figures mixed up and contradicted the figures given in the consultative document. He did not give a proper explanation to the Committee for his mistake in saying that the number had decreased from 151,000 to 57,000.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We now have four different figures in the frame from four different dates. If the Government are to justify refusing a house condition survey, at least they should do their sums correctly and achieve a consistent line. Through my honourable Friend, I ask the Minister to obtain for the Committee the exact figures on the exact dates of the decline in the statistics from the day that the Government came into office until now.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My honourable Friend makes a good point. I have to use my memory to recall what was said in Committee because I have yet to see the written record of that meeting, which is regrettable. If we had it, we could settle the issue. As I recall, the Secretary of State for Scotland on during Second Reading on 11 January that 10 years previously there 121,000 houses were below tolerable standard in Scotland. That means that on 11 January 1978 121,000 houses were below the tolerable standard. The Under-Secretary of State claimed that on 31 December 1977, 11 days before the Secretary of State had said that there were 121,000 such houses, 152,000 were below the tolerable standard, and asked the Committee to believe that in the 11 days between 31 December 1977 and 11 January 1978, 31,000 houses had been moved above the tolerable standard.

The present Government will pay the price of the policies that they are pursuing unless they begin to resolve the real problems of the Scottish people, including massive problems of dampness and condensation, which the Government are preventing local authorities from tackling effetively.

It makes it difficult to concentrate on the issues that are the subject of the debate. In the present debate we are discussing dampness. Considerable concern was expressed by Opposition Members about the statistics provided by
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>238</span>
the Minister, and this has run right through the Minister's contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a copy of the record of the debates on the morning of the third sitting on Tuesday 26 January. The Minister said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In 1985, the overall number of houses avialable for rent exceeded the number of households by about 128,000. We believe that the figure is about 130,000 today."</p></blockquote>
In that debate I took the figures at face value and accepted what the Minister was saying—the point was discussed later—that 130,000 more houses were available. Yet on 26 January the same Minister, in a written answer to my honourable Friend-the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Wray), said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"At 31 March 1987, approximately 21,300 dwellings owned by local authorities were vacant."—[	<i>OfficialReport,</i> 26 January 1988; Vol. 126, c. 174.]</p></blockquote>
On 26 January, the Minister said,
	<br><blockquote><p>"Of the 130,000 houses, we estimate that slightly more than half are in the private rented sector."—[	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 26 January 1988; c. 61.]</p></blockquote>
That means that 65,000 houses are in the public sector. I am confused. I do not know what statistics and basics we are using. It is difficult to know how to focus our attention on the real problems of Scottish housing if that is the quality of the statistics that we receive. On the same day, once in Committee and once in a written answer to another honourable Member, the Minister provided contradictory statistics.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My honourable Friend's question goes to the heart of the debate. Can we trust the statistics that the Government are producing in relation to condensation and dampness?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The experience of the Committee so far has shown that the Minister is unsure of the statistics on Scottish housing that is below the tolerable standard or vacant public sector dwellings. He must also be unsure about the extent of the dampness and condensation problem. That is a terrible indictment of a Government who have held office since 1979. They have been almost 10 years in office and still do not know the state of the Scottish housing stock. We need a house condition survey in Scotland. They have the responsibility to spearhead a campaign to solve the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the tolerable standard. Local authorities differentiate between dampness and condensation, mainly because they are forced from lack of funds to draw a division between them. Dampness is regarded as a more serious problem than condensation. District councils, with the little money that is available to them, try to resolve the dampness problem when it emerges. Therefore, they tend not to have the money to address condensation problems and tell tenants, "It is caused by the way in which you live. You have a bottled gas heater and do not open your windows when you have a bath or cook in the kitchen. It is your problem. Change your lifestyle."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities are often forced into so acting because they do not have the resources with which to tackle condensation. It is time that the Government recognised that and began to make the money
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0210">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>239</span>
available to local authorities so that they can respond to the legitimate complaints from tenants about condensation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One way in which they could do so would be to accept a revised tolerable standard in line with what COSLA requested in its Scottish housing manifesto. I have already pressed the Minister on this matter in Committee but he has yet to respond. Will he accept a revised tolerable standard which classifies not only absence of dampness, but absence of condensation, before a house is regarded as of a tolerable standard for habitation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is an important distinction on which the government will have to express their view. Do they accept that condensation should be classified along with dampness as one of the criteria applied to a tolerable standard? At present, only dampness is considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government accept that proposal, the number of houses below the tolerable standard will shoot up. The Scottish homes and jobs conference estimates that 240,000 houses in Scotland suffer from condensation. If that revised tolerable standard was accepted, another 240,000 houses would be below the tolerable standard and the Government would be forced to do something about them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That shows how critical this debate is. The Government must recognise the problem first and recognise that people are living in miserable conditions as a result of their failure to define the problem and enable local authorities to borrow the necessary money to tackle and eradicate the problem. The Minister must answer our questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to speak because, as you will remember, Mr. Lambie, we were both members of the Select Committee which carried out an investigation into condensation and dampness. When my honourable Friend the Under-Secretary of State answers the debate on the amendment, I hope that he will remember that, in that investigation, the Committee discovered that many Scottish local authorities were refusing to acknowledge that there was a problem. Yet the Committee found that it was not only a problem but a massive problem, which had developed over a period of time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one should deny that resources were one reason why the problem had become so bad. Because of the way in which local authorities had managed their assets—the housing stock—and had not looked after them, depending on one's point of view, many of our citizens lived in conditions that were unacceptable to any civilised society.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman's analysis would appear to be that the reason for the condensation and dampness problems was bad management by the local authorities in failing to deal with the problem. Will he accept that one reason why local authorites were unable to provide the sort of management service which would have prevented those problems from becoming worse was that the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>240</span>
government had deliberately cut resources for the housing revenue account which enables authorities to provide such a service?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Dundee district council has lost £8 million a year from its housing support grant under the Government. Rate fund contributions have also been dramatically cut. The major source of funding for the housing revenue account and management service has been rents. Because of the poverty in Scotland, it is impossible to push rents up to the levels which would have made that a commercial and economic proposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman chooses to ignore the fact that the major source of funding for any local authority running housing stock, and the major source of revenue, is rents. Indeed, if the authorities had followed a policy of proper economic rents instead of deliberately following policies of low rents, they would not have starved themselves of available funds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the honourable Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way in a minute, if the honourable Gentleman will let me spell this out. He has a habit of bouncing in before he has listened to the argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The local authorities knew that their major source of revenue income was from rents. If they followed a deliberate policy of lower rents, those who could afford to pay economic rents did not, but, more important, those who could not afford to pay economic rents and whose rents were being paid largely or in full by the public purse did not make the contribution that they could have made as individuals through the public support that was available in housing benefit. The vast sums of housing benefit paid to Scotland today could have been paid, allowing for inflation, in the same relative terms 10 years ago, but were not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>indicated dissent.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman shakes his head, but those funds are massive. It was a huge source of funding into the housing coffers which the local authorities deliberately denied themselves. That money could have gone to keep the housing stock in reasonable condition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are having more and more interventions. I ask honourable Members to make their intervention an intervention and not a speech—not saying something that they forgot to say when they were speaking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept what you say, Mr. Lambie. The honourable Gentleman makes the point about
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0211">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>241</span>
housing benefit being a huge source of potential revenue for the housing revenue account, and he is right, strictly in terms of the numbers. Sixty per cent, of all the tenants of Dundee district council rely on housing benefit. Dundee district council and Opposition Members object to the deliberate pauperisation of the people of Dundee, making them dependent upon public handouts to pay their way. The honourable Gentleman cannot argue coherently that Dundee district council and other district councils in Scotland have pursued a policy of deliberately pushing up rent, when the rents that they have charged have meant that 60 per cent. of the people living in their houses have had to depend on public handouts to enable them to pay the rents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman has just made my argument for me and I thank him. If those 60 per cent. of people in Dundee and elsewhere had had their rents increased by £1, £2 or £3, whichever figure one cares to take, all that money would have come straight from the public purse into the housing coffers. As a matter of deliberate policy, local authorities were setting themselves up to determine the amount of cash going into the housing coffers and, having made that decision, they cannot say that the Government, of whatever complexion, have not made available to those in need the necessary funds to meet the cost of maintaining their property, keeping it in good condition and making sure that it is habitable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no question but that the local authorities refused to acknowledge that there was a large problem. Their refusal to acknowledge it meant that no one could come to grips with it. Only after the report of the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs did local authorities admit that there was a great problem, so at least one good thing came out of that inquiry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second good thing that came out of it was that the Committee publicised the problem on a huge scale and let the public at large see what appalling conditions in which many of their colleagues and friends had to live. No civilised society should tolerate that. But honourable Members should not be confused. It was not lack of funding; it was the fact that local authorities would not accept that massive funds were available. They are still available and being paid on a massive scale, and that money goes straight into the housing coffers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A clear political decision was made at local government level that the local authorities would be the good guys who would give low rents to the people, but they were depriving the housing coffers of massive funds that should have been used to remedy the dampness and condensation. If anyone is responsible to any great extent, it must be the authorities which, as a deliberate policy, have deprived themselves of hundreds of millions of pounds during the past nine years. When my honourable Friend the Under-Secretary of State replies to the debate I hope that he will acknowledge that it was not that the Government were not giving funds, but that local authorities were deliberately starving themselves of those funds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>242</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the honourable Gentleman saying that it is now Government policy to fund Scottish housing, including repairs, improvements and constuction, through the housing benefits scheme?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The housing benefits scheme is designed to make sure, first, that everyone can live in a home and have it paid for; and, secondly, that the amount of money that an individual receives through housing support will ensure that that house is maintained properly. Had that policy been pursued during the past 15 years rather than the past nine years, there is no question that the funds that were available through the different support systems, today called housing benefit, would have substantially altered the ability of the local authorities to meet the costs of maintaining their stock. They could have approached their task property, sensibly and logically, with real care for the people who were suffering. We hear a lot about care. There is nothing more depressing and demoralising than the humbug that we hear from the Opposition, suggesting that a policy of low rents shows caring. What shows caring is providing homes, making sure that those homes are kept in a fit condition and ensuring that everyone, regardless of income, has the opportunity to live in such a home.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman is about to intervene. Let me tell him that I lived in a council house and my parents could not afford to pay at the time we moved in. My father was unemployed. I speak from first-hand experience. The authority that we were with—it was a long time before we had a Labour authority—was a sensible authority and it recognised that income was not what mattered. What mattered was that people should be housed properly. It had a sliding scale of rents. As the young members of the family—myself included—grew up and went out to work, our rent was increased. It was a sensible, logical way to proceed. That was in Linlathen. Some Opposition Members will know exactly what I am talking about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We get a log of humbug from the Opposition. They talk as if they understand and know. I think that they understand, but they do not always know. In pursuing their own narrow political objectives, they deprive the very people whom they set out to help of the necessary funding to make the houses more habitable and deal substantially with the problems of condensation and dampness. Local authorities could have admitted long ago that there was a problem and dealt with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is always a pleasure to hear lectures on humbug from the honourable Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker).

As the honourable

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the private sector, if the honourable Gentleman is talking about property owned by individuals, those individuals have the answer in their own hands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ah!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, one of the advantages of having a property that one owns and which is increasing in value is that one has the opportunity, as most of us who have homes and understand that do, to borrow against the increased value to improve the quality of the property.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about tenants?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will deal with rented accommodation because I am regularly involved in matters relating to tenants in my constituency. One can get the public health side of the local authority to come in and cause the landlord to carry out the necessary repairs and alterations. If the honourable Gentleman thinks that does not happen, I invite him to come to north Tayside and I will let him see a number of houses where it has actually happened. As with all things, a lot depends on the determination to be successful. If one is determined, one can see the landlords. Many of the landlords are lairds, like the honourable Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) and many of them are very helpful. I do not know what the honourable Gentleman is like with his tenants, but the majority of lairds in my constituency care about their tenants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The ugliness of what has been said by the honourable Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) is—to borrow his phrase—at least stripped of the humbug which much of the written presentation of the Government's attitude to Scottish homes shows. I make that distinction with reference to the honourable Member for Tayside, North and his honourable and learned Friend the Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn), who is currently missing—I suppose that he does not have any clothes to come to the Committee. I understand that the honourable and learned Gentleman suffered a tragedy at the weekend when thousands of pounds worth of clothes and bootees were destroyed by his cleaning lady. Those are the only Conservative Members who have had the guts to debate the Scottish Homes legislation and stand up for what they believe in.

12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister cannot avoid his role. It falls to him to make the best fist that he can of defending the indefensible and dealing with the many unanswerable points made by Opposition Members. Much has been made of the Minister's history in this
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>244</span>
regard, and I have no reason to doubt that it is honourable. I was not a Member at that time. Much has been made of his contributions in the Select Committee and elsewhere to the great housing debates of the last Parliament and his concern about Scottish housing. Times have changed, however, and it is always unedifying and unpleasant to see a set, or at least a damp, trying to become a dry. We see it in the Chamber in the shape of the Secretary of State for Scotland as well as in the Under-Secretary of State who is to reply to the debate. It is an unpleasant sight, rather like a mouse trying to become a rat. Some do it more effectively than others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary of State, the honourable Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) has particular difficulty not only because of the statistical inadequacy of the briefs fed to him by his civil servants. He does not believe that there is no case for a housing conditions survey in Scotland or that dampness is not the greatest issue facing Scottish housing because he knows that what we are saying is true. His performance is pathetically ineffectual. He dodges issue after issue and refuses to answer question after question because he does not believe the arid, bone-dry, Thatcherite answers of his ideological master the Under-Secretary of State, the honourable Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth), who really speaks for the Prime Minister. He does not believe the arid, Right-wing poison fed to him by the new Right of the Conservative party, which has precious few soldiers in Scotland but which nonetheless packs a pretty powerful punch.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galloway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to the point with rising anger which I shall try to subdue, though it is difficult in view of the provocation from Conservative Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Homes legislation is held up by Conservative Members as the great flagship that will sail towards the horizon at free enterprise and solve housing problems in Scotland. If that is true, what justification can there be for not including in the legislation the pledge in amendment No. 51 that Scottish Homes will tackle the biggest single issue in Scotttish housing? I wish to spend some time demonstrating that as I suspect that there will be no recognition of it by Conservative Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is bigger than the shortage of private rented housing in Scotland—the Government—obsession which underlines much of the Scottish Homes legislation. The problem of dampness is bigger than the high cost of borrowing and repayment of mortgages, which will be made more difficult by yesterday's rise in interest rates. It is greater than the huge backlog of repairs and maintenance waiting to done to public sector housing stock as a result of cuts in capital and revenue allocations to local authorities. It is bigger than the problem of escalating rents. The SSHA and most of the district councils in a round of rent increases have recently announced yet another increase of 80p to £2.90. It is bigger than the problem

of homelessness, about which much has been said in the Committee and which has doubled under the Conservative Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Dampness is an infestation, a blight on the lives of hundreds of thousands of families, a blight on property accross Scotland, a blight on the health of many people in Scotland—I hope to deal with that in more detail later—and particularly a blight on the lives of children. It is a national scandal, as the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs demonstrated, under your distinguished chairmanship, Mr. Lambie. Incidentally, it was a spellbinding experience to hear about the depth of knowledge and experience gained by the honourable Member for Tayside, North during his time on the Committee. It is a pity that we cannot have a Select Committee on Scottish Affairs in this Parliament, so that other honourable Members could gain the same experience and knowledge. It is because of the obtuse, bone-headed refusal of honourable Members like the honourable Member for Tayside, North that we do not have such a Committee under your distinguished chairmanship, Mr. Lambie, or that of anyone else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Select Committee report said, this is a national scandal, and it needs a national task force to deal with it. It is important to have an idea of the scale of the problem, because I do not believe that many Conservative Members understand it. Over half a million houses in Scotland—520,000—are suffering from dampness to one degree or another. Dampness is broken up into three degrees—slight, moderate and severe, but even slight dampness infests clothes and soft furniture in a way that some members of the Committee will have seen in their own constituency work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No fewer than 520,000 houses in Scotland are suffering from dampnes. What could be a bigger problem than that? How can we set up a flagship that will deal with the problems of Scottish housing if it refuses the legislative promise that it will deal with a problem on this scale?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An important point, which has been touched on by some of my honourable Friends, including my honourable Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) in a recent intervention, is that 370,000 of those houses are in the public sector. That is bad enough, but 101,000 are owner-occupation. According to what the honourable Member for Tayside, North said, that problem should be easily solved. Why do those house owners not borrow some money on the strength of the escalating value of their house? In many parts of Scotland house prices are not escalating. With the high cost of borrowing, many owner-occupiers simply cannot afford to borrow more money to deal with the problem of dampness. Of the 520,000 damp houses in Scotland, 49,000 are in the private rented sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Tayside, North has had the good fortune to meet caring lairds. In all of Scottish history I never knew of many caring Scottish lairds, and in my experience as a Member of Parliament I do not know many caring private sector landlords, nor do I know how many private sector landlords would respond positively to their tenants
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>246</span>
knocking on their door, complaining about a problem of dampness and asking the landlord to deal with it. I do not believe that there are many such caring landlords in the market. Now that this landlords' charter is in the Bill, perhaps all the new private landlords who will flood the market will be compassionate St. Francis of Assisi-quoting individuals, but I suspect that the truth will be different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If this is a national scandal, it needs—as again the Select Commitee said—a national task force to deal with it. I want to dwell on the subject of a task force. A mere fraction of the billions of pounds of treasure expended on the last task force dispatched by the House and the Government to retake a rocky outcrop in the south Atlantic, and what it is costing us in holding and defending that cluster of rocks, could dry up every single house, not only in Scotland but in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not a cluster of rocks. The Falkland Islands happen to be larger than Wales. Does the honourable Gentleman think of Wales as a cluster of rocks?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not want the Committee to get into a debate on the Falklands conflict. Honourable Members must keep to the terms of amendment No. 51, which deals with Scottish Homes and not with the private sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Lambie. My understanding is that Scottish Homes will be an organisation that will have duties in relation to the private sector as well as the public sector. I hope that my honourable Friend the Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galloway) will be in order in referring to that aspect of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galloway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the reasons that the Government will give for not accepting the amendment is that they do not have the resources to tackle the problem of dampness in Scottish housing. I am trying to establish that that is absolute humbug. There are billions of pounds locked away in the Treasury just waiting for the Budget, to be given in yeat another tax-cutting handout to the richest people in the country, and billions of pounds being wasted on nonsense, including the defending of a cluster of rocks, however much like the size of Wales it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is an important point, because a mere fraction of the billions that are being wasted by the Government could be used to insulate, dry up and end the problem of dampness in Scottish housing, English housing, Welsh housing and Northern Irish housing. The money is there. The political will and the compassion are simply not there. That is why I am certain that the Government will oppose the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder whether Conservative Members really understand the problem. The Minister appeared to, because he has a hard job holding his seat and so has to put himself about a bit, as does the Secretary of State. They must know something about the size of the problem. I will start with the non-human aspects, because I want to say much about the human aspects.

Surely even a Tory, whose love of Mammon is lengendary, can see the economic sense in the old adage that a stitch in time saves nine. It is obvious that the life expectancy of housing in this country is being drastically shortened by the problem of dampness and condensation. It is obvious that the costs of repairs and maintenance of Scottish housing is escalated by the problem of dampness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members love bricks and mortar. Often the only raison d-etre for much of their politics is to acquire, and encourage others to acquire, as much property as they can. Surely there are property arguments, that can strike a chord with Conservative Members that would allow them to see the sense of putting some money and energy into dealing with this. Dampness is the biggest reason for the descent into slum status of houses built in the 1960s. My honourable Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) gave a good example of it in Hutchesontown E, in Glasgow—whose houses are very close to the centre of town, ideally placed for the hundreds of thousands of people who want to live in the centre of Glasgow or as near to the centre as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those houses descended—one might say plummeted—into slum status, then lay derelict for I know not how many years, and now lie a pile of rubble, a gap site, where desirable family housing in a strategically important location once stood. The main reason for that was dampness. The Minister cannot deny that. Therefore, a stitch in time is what we are asking Scottish Homes for in terms of the property aspect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What concerns Opposition Members more than the bricks and mortar is the human cost of dampness. I am sure that many Conservative Members have no idea of the problems caused to families in Scotland by dampness on this scale. The inquiry into housing in Glasgow was chaired by Professor Sir Robert Grieve—no Bolshevik, card-carrying Red, but a man with the compassion and foresight to look into Scottish housing and produce conclusions that, if the Minister has read them, will cause him some embarrassment when he answers the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to quote from the report, because it is germane to the arguments put by the honourable Members for Tayside, North about the way in which rents should have been increased to put this problem right. At page 23 the report says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In Glasgow household incomes are very low in the public rented sector; 83 per cent. of council tenants have gross incomes below £5,200 … and many people cannot meet the real costs of housing without subsidy, through tax relief and repair grants in the private sector and through housing benefit and indirectly through housing support grant in the public sector. In Glasgow 21.4 per cent. of the workforce are employed with much higher rates of over 40 per cent. in some neighbourhoods. Some 125,000 Council tenants (74 per cent.) were in receipt of housing benefit at September 1985."</p></blockquote>
I come to the important point:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We are concerned at the evidence of strong links between poverty or low incomes, poor housing conditions and high hospitalisation. Within Glasgow there are high rates of infant admissions to hospital from the 4 peripheral estates and the Springburn area. The evidence shows that socio-economic and housing factors are closely related to such admission rates. Inadequate heating and dampness appear to be the key housing factors."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>248</span>
That is the truth. Dampness is making people ill in very large numbers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sitting opposite us, although he is not listening—he never is—is the honourable Gentleman who masquerades as the Under-Secretary of State responsible for health in Scotland and who, a la Under-Secretary of State for Health and Social Security, the honourable Member for Derbyshire, West (Mrs Currie), is constantly lecturing the people of the north and the people of Scotland about their confectionery-eating habits, their smoking and their drinking, saying that they are the key reasons why public health in the north and in Scotland is so abysmally low, and among the worst in the developed world, and certainly among the worst if not the worst on the continent of Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How can these people prattle on about what are essentially peripheral health issues? In a debate the other night the honourable Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Mr. Forth) referred to Scotland's confectionery-eating habits as a major public health problem in Scotland, how can that compare to the problems in public health, particularly for children, that are being caused by dampness?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am at a loss to understand why decaying teeth have anything to do with dampness and condensation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galloway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a towering intervention from the honourable Member for Tayside, North, as we have come to expect. I shall not even stoop to answer it, because I am making a serious point, which affects the lives of many thousands of people, including those in the housing estate, as the honourable Member for Tayside, North is fond of reminding us, from whence he came. He has forgotten most of what he saw and learnt there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely even the Minister will not try to deny all the studies by respected academics in health and housing, which demonstrate a clear relationship between dampness and respiratory and bronchial illness, particularly in children—headaches, gut problems, diarrhoea, and bad stomachs, particularly where there is mould, fungus or dampness. I have some of that in my constituency, and I can tell honourable Members that it is a revolting sight. To go into a house where fungus and dampness have come through the back of a wardrobe into the clothes, out of the wardrobe and into the children's teddy bears and ultimately infested the children's lungs and stomachs is no laughing matter. It is a very serious matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned earlier that dampness comes in three degrees—slight, moderate and severe. I shall deal only with the problem of severe dampness. In Scotland, 67,000 families with children live in housing conditions where severe dampness has been diagnosed. The health of 120,000 children is seriously at risk. In the House and in the newspapers one hears about the hypocritial concern of Conservative Ministers about the need to care for and protect children. Clause 28 of the Local Government Bill was introduced to protect children from the promotion of homosexuality in schools or in the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0215">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>249</span>
media—[Honourable Members: "Hear, hear!"] Conservative Members say, "Hear, hear!". We hear all sorts of prattle from them about the need to look after our children. I have a young child—I suppose that most members of the Committee have or have had young children—and I do not know how anyone can put his hand on his heart, walk through the lobby and vote to protect children from some non-existent threat of homosexuality and then vote to continue to do next to nothing about a problem which puts the health of 120,000 children living in severely damp houses at serious risk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall close on that point. Some Conservatives may laugh and think that I am being melodramatic. Many of them come from privileged backgrounds and represent privileged constituencies. The honourable Member for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Arbuthnot) is still not listening. He is a former deputy mayor of Kensington and Chelsea, but he has a vote on this Committee and he will vote against the amendment. It is to people like him that my remarks are directed. If they could hear all those children coughing and wheezing and their mothers crying, they might have some shame at voting against the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall follow the remarks of the honourable Friend the Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galloway), perhaps not with the same passion but I hope with similar force. Having listened to my honourable Friends, we are left in some bemusement. We have already expressed our bemusement at the Govenment's statistics, the difficulties in understanding them and the contribution that they are supposed to make to the debate. I am throughly bemused at the attitude of the Government. Our arguments are not mere rhetoric, taken out of the blue. We have given detailed information from a number of reputable reports, and most of our contributions have been about two fairly sensible points. The list is the need for a national task force to tackle the serious and severe national problem of dampness and condensation in housing. The second is the severe effect that that national problem, is having on the nation's health, especially on the more deprived elements of our community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My honourable Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths) quoted the Scottish Development Department's Labour Force survey and the Grieve report. There have also been quotations from the Edinburgh university research report entitled, "Responding to Public Need: A Study of Housing and Health". Various quotations and elements of those reports have been picked up by honourable Friends. Every one of the reports points to the serious and damning effects of dampness on the nation's health. I shall concentrate on that aspect because the need for a task force has been well made out by the Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The full Scottish ministerial team is present in the Committee. Presumably they are capable of discussing the interrelationship of their various departmental responsibilities—perhaps that is a wee
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>250</span>
bit optimistic—or at least meeting from time to time to discuss problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My honourable Friend the Member for Hillhead has given the Committee some statistics. We know that 420,000 people live in houses where dampness is severe enough to damage clothing and soft furnishings and 67,000 families, including 120,000 children, live in severely damp housing. All the reports to which we have referred show that there is a serious risk to children's health, so we are storing up problems for the future. Yet the honourable Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth), the Under-Secretary of State responsible for health and social work in Scotland, just sits there and makes no contribution to the debate. The reports tell him that it is a preventable problem. If one ignores all the other factors in the community, the other illnesses to which children are prone—such as genetic illnesses, those inherent in the atmosphere and other problems, this is one preventable risk that the Government could take action to avoid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have spend a great deal of time elsewhere in the House discussing the problems faced by the National Health Service. We know that those problems are created by pressure on the system and lack of funding. We see all kinds of contortions from the Prime Minister downwards to get away from the problems. Statistics are cited regularly. We heard this week that the honourable Member for Stirling in his ministerial capacity had written to various health boards offering to make money available for them to spend in the private sector because in his assessment the Health Service cannot cope with waiting lists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here we have another statistic—120,000 Scottish children at serious risk because of the state of Scottish housing. There has been a Government inquiry and various reports, of which the Black report is probably the most famous. Those inquiries considered preventive medicine, but we have seen no co-ordination between Departments, nor any evidence that those responsible for health have discussed the matter with those responsible for housing to try to find ways to deal with the problem. The Government are compartmentalised and unable to cross over the boundaries. The health side cannot say, "These 120,000 Scottish children will be a serious burden on the Health Service and therefore on all of us in years to come, so we must do something to prevent that." We see what my honourable Friend the Member for Hillhead described as troglodyte opposition to a fairly progressive measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment simply places a burden on Scottish Homes to fund, provide and assist in the provision of a programme. It does not state that it has to spend tomorrow the millions of pounds that need to be spent on Scottish housing to solve the problem. Scottish Homes simply has to work out a programme to prevent and eliminate dampness. The amendment puts no time scale on it. Opposition Members want to test the Government's willingness to operate through what we hope will become the principal Scottish housing agency to work towards the elimination of this problem. That will bring long-term benefit for all. It is ludicrous and hypocritical for a Government

who set such store by good housekeeping, cutting public expenditure and making the best use of expenditure to fail even to begin to tackle the problem of dampness in Scottish housing. They are storing up a long-term problem. Apart from the human misery involved, they are storing up a long-term problem for the Health Service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For all those reasons, I support the amendment and urge the Minister, before he makes a final decision, to confer with his honourable Friend to see whether there is scope for an amendment that would place on public record an obligation on Scottish Homes to tackle the problem nationally, as is urgently needed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am glad to welcome you to the Chair today, Mr. Lambie. It is appropriate that you should be in the Chair, because you were the chairman of the Select Committee which reported on dampness; that Committee sat over a period of months and I had the honour to serve on it. You responded to my request and came to West Pilton in my constituency, which has been the subject of some remarks this morning. I think that the report of the Select Committee was valuable and important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was very worried to hear the Minister say that the contribution from the honourable Member for Tayside, North was in line with Government policy. The honourable Member for Tayside, North suggested that district councils should pursue rent policies which would lead to many more people becoming dependent on housing benefit and state handouts. I always understood that it was Government policy to discourage people from becoming dependent on state benefits. He advocated a policy which would result in the cost of housing benefit increasing substantially. I thought that it was Government policy to reduce the cost of housing benefit; that is why they have taken more than 1 million people out of housing benefit, and the Minister and his honourable Friend voted for that measure recently. If that is not in line with Government policy, the Minister should make it clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The thrust of my honourable Friend's comments were most certainly in line with Government policy. On rents, I would say to the honourable Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) that there is a strong relationship between
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>252</span>
rents and managment and maintenance in Scotland. This point was mentioned in the Grieve report, which recommended that rents should be increased to provide for increased expenditure on management and maintenance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In relation to data collection on dampness—a point made by the honourable Member for Dundee, East—the statistics available to the Scottish Development Department are those submitted by local authorities in their checklists. Their accuracy depends on the authorities themselves. We collect information on dampness and condensation from local authorities annually. Analysis of the 1987 checklists and condensation returns—not all of which are in yet—is incomplete, so we cannot assess authorities' revised planned expenditure, or revised estimates for total eradication of those problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the private sector, the 1984 figures published by the Labour force survey are the most recent. They show that 13.5 per cent. of owner-occupied houses were affected by condensation. The 1986 figure is expected to be 11.3 per cent., though the analysis is not yet complete for publication. In the public sector in November 1986, the checklist returns by local authorities suggest that about 40,000 houses are affected by rising or penetrating damp, which represents 4.7 per cent. of the stock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the time scale for eradication, it is impossible to assess when the problem will be substantially eradicated. That depends on the progress made by local authorities within the priorities that they set and the substantial resources that we have made available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths) mentioned private developers in what used to be part of my constituency, saying that some developments were affected by dampness. I can only say that I have had no complaints to that effect. Of course, a private individual would have a right of redress against the developer if the problems were the fault of the developer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Dundee, East asked about allocations to Dundee. The provisional allocations for the housing revenue account were allocated in December. In 1987–88, they were £13 million; for 1988–89 they are £15.2 million, which is an increase slightly above the rate of inflation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister knows well—I read the letter to him in a previous sitting of the Committee—that Dundee district council has drawn attention to the fact that the allocation for next year will be reduced from £16.5 million to £15.2 million; £1.3 million has been taken off the allocation to Dundee district council for 1988–89. The Minister has not replied to Dundee district council, nor to that point, which I have made repeatedly in Committee.

in and the amount of need in every part of Scotland. Areas of most priority will have the highest increases.

The honourable Member for Dundee, East asked about Hutchesontown East, which I saw being demolished in the summer when I was visiting SSHA flats. That was not solely because of condensation and dampness; poor design and construction faults were undoubtedly contributory factors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am happy to give the below tolerable standard statistics again to clear up the matter once and for all. In 1977, the below tolerable standard figures were 150,000; in 1979,121,000; in 1983, 81,000; and, most recently, 55,000. We had a thorough debate on those figures at our previous sitting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that the Secretary of State's definition of below tolerable standard, as given to us in the debate—which is acknowledged to be inaccurate because it did not encompass the nine categories of below tolerable standard—or is that what the Act says?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State gave an answer to the honourable Member for Glasgow, Garscadden on 3 Decembr 1987, at col. 667, which is entirely accurate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Dundee, East asked about the criteria for the tolerable standard being changed, and I shall come to that in a moment. Condensation depends very much on the lifestyle and numbers of the occupants. Only some factors are affected by the construction and maintenance of the building, with which the tolerable standard deals. The honourable Gentleman puts the case for revising the below tolerable standard criteria now in statute. We must await the response to consultations on the Green Paper on improvements and repair grants.

The honourable Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galloway) asserted that the rents of SSHA tenants had gone up by £2.90.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right. The average increase is £1.90. I just wished to clear up that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment draws attention to a problem which the Government take very seriously and in relation to which we have taken action, but on which the Opposition do not have a monopoly of concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Condensation and dampness make good houses uninhabitable and many people's lives thoroughly miserable. We have made substantial special allocations to local authorities in recent years, distributed broadly on the basis of authorities' estimated expenditure plans for remedial work. This year—1987–88—we have allocated £25 million; next year it will be £27 million. The aim of the special allocation is to encourage authorities to give priority to serious problems and to enable them to continue to accelerate progress in dealing with the severest cases. I stress, however, that the special allocation is not intended to set an upper limit for expenditure on treating condensation and dampness. There have
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>254</span>
been substantial increases in normal housing revenue account allocations, and it is reasonable to assume that local authorities should spend a proportion of that on this problem. Allocations issued last March on the HRA block for 1987–88 totalled £411.4 million. That is £89 million or 27.6 per cent. more than the issued allocations for 1986–87 and an increase of £184 million or 81 per cent. during the past three years. As I said earlier, all that happened after the Select Committee's report on dampness had been published.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that there had been a substantial increase in housing allocation. He is aware, of course, that Aberdeen district council's allocation for next year has been reduced by £1.25 million. How will it tackle the problem of dampness in its 9,000-odd public sector houses?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman came to see me and I was able to make an additional allocation of £40,000 in relation to the non-HRA block. If some authorities receive more money than others, those which receive less will obviously be disappointed. Allocations are made entirely on the basis of need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some honourable Members have asked why there is so much concentration on the west central belt of Scotland and the Glasgow area. Many of the worst problems relating to dampness are in the west central belt of Scotland. Part of Petersburn in Coatbridge which I visited in the summer, is a case in point, and I could give dozens more examples.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I well appreciate the extent and depth of the problems that condensation and dampness can cause. I was a member of the Select Committee that considered dampness and condensation and since undertaking my current responsibilities, I have seen for myself what needs to be done and what can achieved. In November 1986, authorities' estimates of five-year expenditure on condensation and dampness had risen from £214 million to £477 million. That is an average of £95 million per annum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The additional resources made available on the HRA block for 1987–88 should have allowed authorities to continue existing programmes and initiate new projects to tackle condensation and dampness. It is not possible to say how much has been spent on dealing with condensation and dampness, as much of the necessary work is carried out as part of modernisation and repair programmes. A recent report commissioned by the Scottish Development Department—"Thermal Upgrading in House Modernisation"—emphasised that it is sensible and cost-effective for housing authorities to incorporate better heating systems and insulation when carrying out modernisation of houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not surprisingly, given the increased resources which have been made available, there are encouraging signs from the checklists submitted annually by local authorities that the scale of the problem is decreasing. Checklists submitted in November 1986 show that the number of houses requiring treatment for condensation fell in the previous year by 37,000 to 203,000 and from 28 per
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0218">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>255</span>
cent. to 24 per cent. of the total stock. Perhaps more importantly, the proportion of affected stock in the most severe category fell from 25 to 12 per cent. in the year to November 1986, the proportion of total stock which was affected by rising or penetrating dampness came down from 7.7 per cent. to 4.7 per cent., which represents 40,000 houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it right that the problem continues to be dealt with directly by the affected authorities, as the bulk of the problem lies in the public sector. The well-intentioned attempts to build quickly through system techniques have compounded the problems arising from poor ventilation and heating. The lifestyle of those living in the house is also crucial. The combination and interaction of those factors may lead to condensation and dampness in the home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not surprisingly, given the causal factors, there is no all-embracing remedy. In the past, there may have been a tendency to view the solutions to such problems rather simplistically, in a way which treated the symptoms but masked the problem. In May 1986, the Scottish Development Department organised seminars to discuss practical solutions and ways of properly targeting remedies to specific problems. There are already many projects, pilot and mainstream, which focus attention on various aspects of the range of remedies. For example, the "Heat with Rent" scheme, operated by councils together with the South of Scotland Electricity Board, encourages the maintenance of general heating at levels adequate to keep condensation at bay. Other projects, such as that run by Heatwise, concentrate on improvements to draughtproofing and insulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The private sector has not suffered to anything like the same extent. The main responsibility for dealing with condensation and dampness in private property rests with the owners, but substantial assistance to tackle some of the problems is available through improvement and repair grants. Local authorities have a duty to ensure that houses which do not meet the tolerable standard are closed, demolished or brought up to the tolerable standard within a reasonable period.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
To meet the tolerable standard, a house must, among other things be substantially free from rising or penetrating damp and have satisfactory provision for heating and ventilation. Since 1979, the number of below tolerable standard houses in the private sector has been more than halved to 57,000. I have already given the figures for the different years.

I see no case for Scottish Homes acting as a channel for funding for local authorities.

numbers of houses that are below the tolerable standard. He keeps quoting figures which everyone knows are inaccurate. He seems to be contradicting himself.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the honourable Gentleman for helping to clarify the point.

I am sure that Scottish Homes, inheriting the substantial experience of the SSHA in related problems, will provide valuable practical experience and assistance in partnership with local authorities. But it would not be helpful to confuse the responsibility as between Scottish Homes and local authorities as the amendment suggests. A confusion of responsibilities could only be to the detriment of tenants who continue to live in very unpleasant conditions. I am suprised that honourable Gentlemen who have expressed concern that Scottish Homes should not encroach on the responsibilities of local authorities propose this amendment. On reflection, the honourable Member for Edinburgh, South may wish to withdraw it. If not, I ask the Committee to reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is extremely unlikely.

What is Scottish Homes to do? We have accepted that there is a case for a co-ordinating agency to help local authorities and other landlords to improve housing provision in Scotland, to provide funds, back-up and advice services and to ensure that the policy to improve the housing stock in Scotland can go ahead. But every time that we, on behalf of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, suggest to the Committee areas in which an agency such as Scottish Homes could do a useful job, we get knocked straight back by the Minister. All that the Government really want Scottish Homes to do is to provide subsidies to the private sector and to carry on the Government's experiments in social engineering and developing more private landlordism in Scotland. If that is all that they have in mind for Scottish Homes, they have been putting forward a pretty bogus prospectus in the build-up to the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has said how concerned he is about dampness, and that he stands by everything that he said when you, Mr. Lambie, and I and he, and even the honourable Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker), were talking about damp houses in the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs back in 1983. That was in the days when the honourable Member for Tayside, North was prepared to serve on a Select Committee on Scottish Affairs. Here we are debating a recommendation from that Select Committee, of which he was a Member and which he supported, yet he will apparently now vote against the principle of one of its specific recommendations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The recommendations were for a task force to deal with the problems of dampness—it was referred to as "a social evil". Yet the Government whom he supports are suggesting that a task force can be set up—this Scottish Homes operation—which could do a useful job in his area, analysing the problems, setting down a strategy for solving the problems, targeting money to deal with the problem, and working in partnership with local authorities. But no, the Government do not want that to happen. They have other jobs in mind for Scottish Homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister cannot get away with his absurd answers to these debates time after time. We had exactly the same story in relation to the housing condition survey. We illustrated at great length and in great detail that the statistics on which the Scottish Development Department was operating were little better than fiction, and we urged the Minister to try to obtain better information and statistics so that the job could be done better. But he is not interested in the facts. He is interested in continuing to obscure the picture and to conceal the crisis in Scottish housing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the honourable Member accept that the below tolerable standard measure relates primarily to private sector conditions?

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>258</span>
cheerfully conceding that private landlords and house-owners in Scotland have such an appalling record that they have 99 per cent. of the below tolerable standard housing in Scotland, one wonders why the Government want to give even more power and authority to private landlords under the Bill. But I do not accept his figures. I do not want to go through everything in the Glasgow house condition survey again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because those facts and figures are on the record. We have invited the Government to accept that they are operating on duff figures. They are working in cloud-cuckoo-land if they are basing their strategy for funding housing in Scotland on those figures. They are rubbish. Whatever the reason may be, the figures are badly misleading. A responsible Government operating in that area should, as a very early priority, seek accurate information so that they can quantify what needs to be done and how best to go about it. But I fear that this Government are more interested in concealing the scale of the crisis than in resolving it.

These are neat little debating points with which we can enjoy ourselves in Committee, but there is more to this subject than debating points. Many thousands of people whom we represent in Scotland, be they in private sector or public sector housing, are living in intolerable conditions. Their children's health is being affected; indeed, the health of all members of the family has been affected by the infestation of their homes with fungus and fungus spores. The sheer demoralisation of living in property where it is a pure waste of time to go on decorating, hanging new curtains and laying carpets, because they will rot almost as fast as one puts them down, is a national scandal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All that we are appealing for is a proper analysis of the problem and how best to deal with it. My honourable Friend the Member for East Kilbride (Mr. Ingram) could probably tell us about the valuable work done on that subject by the Building Research Establishment, which is in his constituency. It could probably help us to find better methods of insulation for new houses and existing property. Many things can be done about the crisis, but we shall be unable to deal with it if the Government keep burying their head in the sand and saying, "What crisis?" I am afraid that we have had another spectacle of that this morning from the Under-Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is for my honourable Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South to decide what to do with the amendment which he moved so ably. The honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) has not had an opportunity to take part in the debate, but I know that he cares about this matter because, as a constituent of his, I have a copy of his election address. It does not mention the Liberal party anywhere, although it says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Archy Kirkwood speaks out on the issues that matter. Positive points from the Alliance programme."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0220">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>259</span>
He could find only 13 positive points in the alliance programme, but one of them—I want to be fair to him—is on housing. He says that there should be an increase in the
	<br><blockquote><p>"capital available to insulate private and council houses, and eradicate damp."</p></blockquote>
Now we see why the honourable Gentleman had such massive support in Roxburgh and Berwickshire: he concealed his allegiance to the Liberal party, or whatever it is called now, and made it clear that he was anxious about dampness in housing. I sincerely hope that he will be with us when we vote on the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Labour Members have spoken for more than two hours and 10 minutes on the amendment and the Government have difficulty in cobbling together even 20 minutes' worth in defence of their Bill. That is because little in the Bill is worth defending. Labour Members have hammered home point after point on the problems of Scottish people living in damp houses. The Minister read the figures as though he was reading the lunch menu in a Wimpy bar. I gather from the way in which he read them that he found them more indigestible than inedible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>260</span>
The Minister's figures show that spending on dampness will fall during the next five years when the problem is likely to increase. In Central region, spending will be cut by £100,000 from £2.5 million to £2.4 million; in Dumfries it will be almost halved from £1.4 million; in Lothian it will be cut by £1 million; and in Tayside spending will be cut by £1.5 million. The Minister seems to take some credit for those figures, but they are in the latest housing checklist. The Government said that less than £30 million would be spent on dampness by councils, but the councils have asked to spend more than £78 million. Government spending on alleviating dampness is paltry. The Minister is not even offering more of the same; he is offering less of the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister was a sorry sight fumbling with his figures. I suspect that he does not care about them and that he cares less about the facts and even less about the people who have to suffer in damp houses. The honourable Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) castigated local councils for not following his advice on dampness, but the Tory solutions were spelt out in those 20 minutes: they lay in the hands of the tenants. The Secretary of State for the Environment seeks to double rents to over £28, a move endorsed by the Minister and the honourable Member for Tayside, North. That was one solution: make the tenants pay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
