	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be helpful to Members if I make a number of summary points on the changes that I announced this morning on the right to buy cost floor arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Cost floor means the price below which the sale price cannot fall. Outstanding debt means the original debt less the debt that has been repaid, and historic costs are those incurred by the authority. Those definitions may be obvious, but I thought that I should mention them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1114</span>
We are replacing the present test, in which the debt outstanding on the house is the crucial factor, with a cost floor based on historic costs—the actual costs incurred by the authority in providing or improving the house since the relevant date. That date will be the beginning of the financial year five years before the right to buy application is made. Thus, if a local authority tenant applies to buy his house in November 1988, the cost floor will be the total costs incurred by the authority on that house since 1 April 1983. The price that the tenant has to pay for his house will not fall below that figure. This date will roll forward each year. So, if a tenant applies in July 1989, the cost floor will be the costs incurred on the house since April 1984. For local authorities, 1 April is the beginning of the financial year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result of the change that we announced, some tenants will be able to buy their houses at a local price. Those tenants who decide to remain as local authority tenants will not, however, be badly affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where the authority receives housing support grant at present, the housing support grant payable to that authority will compensate—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. This is all very interesting and we look forward to debating it, but am I not right in thinking that the announcement that the Minister is talking about has nothing to do with the Bill or the clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I was assisting hon. Members, but I am in the hands of the Committee. Outstanding debt relates to two subjects—the right to buy and the right to transfer. This morning's statement related only to the right to buy. The key difference is that the right to transfer does not carry with it a discount.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point of order was correct, but as a press release was announced this morning I thought that it would be helpful to allow the Minister to stray from the amendment. If the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) wishes to press his point of order, I shall ask the Minister to stick to the amemdments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief on this subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where the authority fails narrowly to receive housing support grant, this grant may once again become payable. Where the authority does not receive housing support grant, this means that the rent level necessary to balance the housing revenue account is below the level assumed for the Secretary of State's housing support grant calculations. If rents were to rise sufficiently as a result of sales of property below the outstanding debt levels, housing support grant would become payable again. In all authorities, most sales will take place at prices well above outstanding debt. That is because the houses will be older and will have risen in price over the years, and because tenants' discount entitlement is often not enough to lower the price below the outstanding debt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today's announcement will be welcomed by tenants and by many public sector landlords, where
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0692">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1115</span>
much of the cost of building or improving houses has been met in recent years by receipts from council house sales. I have in mind particularly the new towns. The hon. Member for East Kilbride (Mr. Ingram) said this morning that there may be little or no debt outstanding on many new town houses. I understand that that is the case. The change to a cost floor based on historic costs is in line with what the new town development corporations have been seeking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tenants of houses built or extensively modernised within the last five years will be little if at all affected by today's announcement. Some tenants of houses built or improved between 1979 and 1983 may find themselves, according to their tenancy record, able to buy their houses under the right to buy for several thousands of pounds less under the new arrangements. Some 36,000 houses were built in that period, and 1,000 have already been sold. But selling prices under the right to buy will depend crucially on each individual tenant's record of tenancy, and it is therefore impossible to give an accurate estimate of additional sales which might be generated as a result of today's announcement. Nor can we forecast the additional receipts that will accrue, or the numbers of houses where sales may take place below the level of debt outstanding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that today's announcement will encourage additional right to buy sales, without leaving public sector landlords in the position of having to sell houses under the right to buy immediately after they are built, for less than the construction price. Today's announcement will allow authorities to reach sensible building, modernisation and allocation policies without the distorting effect which the absence of any cost floor might have introduced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a fascinating little excursion into the Tenants Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Act in relation to the statutory right to buy. I will give an example of the situation that could arise, first in relation to the right to buy, and secondly in relation to part III of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us say that it costs £35,000 for a local authority to build a new house in Scotland. If a tenant who has the full qualifying period of tenancy transfers into such a brand new council house, after five years he can purchase the house with the full discount of 60 per cent. on the district valuer's valuation. He could therefore buy a house that had cost the district council £35,000 five years earlier for £15,000 or £16,000. I am the first to acknowledge that that is nice for the tenant, but it would be rather imprudent for a local authority to run the risk of throwing away public money to that extent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman accept that in a five year period the value of a house will rise considerably, so the problem will not arise in the case of many of those houses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So the Government are founding their policy on the hope that there will be rip-roaring inflation in house prices. That may happen, but it should not necessarily be welcomed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1116</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister came to Edinburgh, where many houses have been sold, he would see that the pattern of valuations and receipts there contradicts his view. Prices in Edinburgh stuck at a basic level for several years. With the increase in discounts, there will be fewer receipts, but that is another argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right and he has the benefit of knowledge of circumstances in Edinburgh. As the Government are proposing that after five years a sitting tenant should be able to buy his split-new house with a 60 per cent. discount, it stands to reason that the local authority will be taking a serious risk with the money for which it is responsible if it builds houses in such circumstances. Even a district auditor might criticise a local authority that went ahead with building knowing that that property would be devalued at such a dramatic rate under the statutory provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to move from the right to buy, which is not strictly relevant to the Bill, to the circumstances that could arise under part III in which a speculative landlord may wish to move into such a property market. Five years after a house is built for £35,000, an approved landlord may knock at the door asking the tenant to sign on the dotted line. The tenant may sign, unaware of the risk that he or she is taking. The landlord may then go to the district council saying that he wishes to buy the house, and activate the procedure laid down in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The district valuer will then be asked to give a valuation. Such valuations are always below the market valuation. Furthermore, the valuation will be reduced by one third because of the sitting tenant, so it may be about £20,000 or £25,000. That means that about £10,000 has already been written off the value of the house. If the transaction goes through and the private landlord acquires the property, he may be able to get rid of the tenant after a few years because of the insecurity of the assured tenancy system. He will then be left with a vacant, nearly new house that may easily be worth £40,000 or £50,000 on the market. Therefore, at public expense, that speculator landlord will have achieved a windfall profit of £20,000 or £25,000 on one property. That is what the Government seem to condone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland announced that the five-year cost floor would cave in for local authority houses sold compulsorily to the tenant or to a speculator landlord.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From another announcement this morning I understand that the relevant period for England and Wales will be eight years. I do not like either of those figures, as they are both irrelevent and inappropriate, but I should like the Minister to explain the discrepancy between the two announcements by two different Ministers in Committees on the same Corridor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was noticeable that when the Minister made his statement hon. Members on both sides could not unerstand it, with the notable exception of the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) who knows everything
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0693">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1117</span>
anyway. I think that it was the hon. and learned Member for Perth Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn) who nicknamed him the Encyclopedia Billyanica, which is exactly what he seems to be. However, matters seem clearer now because the Minister has given us more information this afternoon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, if a house has been built or substantially improved since 1978 the discount will be reduced if the outstanding debt owed by the public sector authority—the district council in this case—exceeds the market value minus the tenant's discount. The Minister gave the example of a house that had cost £22,000. A sitting tenant of 10 years' tenure would qualify for a 40 per cent. discount of about £9,000. That leaves £13,000 to be compared to the outstanding debt. That sum may be much less than the outstanding debt owed to the district council. If it were, the resent discount would have to be reduced to compensate the council and its remaining tenants from having to bear the costs involved in subsidising the tenant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that that arrangement will be replaced by a modified cost-floor arrangement. That is the sort of expression that caused so much confusion this morning. He seems to be saying that under the new arrangement more tenants will be able to get bigger discounts, and district councils will be protected because of their new build programmes. That shows the Minister's sense of humour, as few district councils now have new build programme because they have been starved of cash by the Government. The Minister believes that the new build programme and modernisation and allocation policies will be protected from distortion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That has to be humbug. The Minister cannot simultaneously favour the tenant without acting equally favourably on behalf of the district councils and their remaining tenants who have to bear the cost of dealing with the outstanding debt on the houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is now being proposed that if the selling price, taking account of the tenant's discount, is less than the historic cost of building, the discount will be restricted. Let us take as an example a house built in 1983, within the specified five-year period, which cost £28,000. The Minister conceded that in that period the value would have gone up to about £40,000. Therefore, a tenant, after five years, would get a 35 per cent. discount—that is, £14,000 of a £40,000 market value, leaving a sum of £26,000 which is less than the historic cost to the district council of constructing the house. Under the new arrangement, the discount available to the tenant will be reduced, so that instead of £26,000 accruing to the council on the sale of the house it will get £28,000. There will be £2,000 less in discount, and at least the council will get what it paid for for the building in 1983.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That applies only on the five-year limit. If the tenant is prepared to wait for a year, he will get an even bigger discount, because there will be no reduction as he will be outwith the five-year period. That will happen increasingly. Tenants will wait six
	<span class='label label-info column'>1118</span>
years so that the provision no longer applies and the discount is not restricted. They will then buy the house with no penalty. The only penalty will be that on the district council and its remaining tenants and the ratepayers, who will be responsible for the outstanding debt. The Minister has not addressed that problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same applies to houses that have been improved. For example, £15,000 may have been spent on improving a house in 1983. That is not an exaggerated figure. I know of some modernisations in Dundee that include new windows and new central heating systems and cost £17,000 or £18,000 per house. A sum of £15,000 could have been spent in April 1983 to modernise a house that a tenant may buy five years later. The tenant may have been in that house for 40 years and thus will be entitled to the full 60 per cent. discount, which would mean that he could buy it for £16,000. If he waited for six years after the improvements had been carried out, there would be no reduction in discount so it would be an even bigger bargain. Therefore, £16,000 could buy a modernised house on which the council spent £15,000 only a few years previously. The outstanding debts on the building and the repairs will remain and, while the tenant walks away with a bargain, the district council and its remaining tenants will be left with the burden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is using the Bill to create a landlords' charter and to undermine public sector tenancies. There will be no protection for district councils or those who choose to remain as their tenants. That is in line with the Government's thinking in the White Paper. The Minister envisages a reduced role for local authorities in providing houses for rent. It is another attempt to drive people out of district council houses and into the independent rented sector, particularly to the Minister's own favoured form of tenure—private rented sector—from which his friends can make a great deal of money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tenants who choose to remain with district councils will be asked to pay the real market price of the houses. Those who choose to buy the houses are shielded by the Government from the full market price—the price has to be borne by those who remain with the district council. The Minister must accept that they will be subsidising the sitting tenants. It is nonsense for the Minister to say that it is possible to recoup the money that was spent five or six years previously. That money will have been eroded by five or six years of inflation, so the £ 15,000 or £28,000 that can be recouped today will not be able to buy the same kind of house that it could have bought five or six years ago. From every angle, that is a bad deal for public sector tenants and for the public sector generally, which will be made to bear the brunt of the Government's actions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to draw to the Minister's attention two briefs that were handed to Committee Members. The first is from the Institute of Housing In Scotland, which points out that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The prospects of the removal of the cost-floor is of considerable significance … cost-conscious councils (particularly those no longer in receipt of subsidy)"—</p></blockquote>
which the Minister has accepted is the majority of councils—
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0694">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1119</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"will be reluctant to incur expenditure on modernisation if there is no assurance that the debt so incurred can be redeemed upon sale."</p></blockquote>
The Minister announced just such arrangements. There is no assurance that the debt incurred by district councils when modernising properties and building new houses will be redeemed upon the sale of that house to a sitting tenant. The Minister has announced today an initiative that will lead to district councils being more reluctant to spend money in upgrading their housing because they know that they are ultimately incurring greater debt, which they will be unable to redeem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Society of Scotland also draws attention to that. It says that section 62(7) of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 ensures
	<br><blockquote><p>"that the price fixed for sale to the tenant is not less than the outstanding debt incurred in providing the property or carrying out repairs thereto."</p></blockquote>
It asked for a similar provision to be put into this Bill. The Minister will not do that. He is not listening to the housing bodies, to the public sector, or to those who know about housing. He is proceeding in a cavalier fashion to try to undermine the public sector. That is the only rationale for such a move, which does not favour but actually handicaps tenants who remain in the public sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the pick-a-landlord provisions, the district valuer must put a value on the house that a private sector landlord is purchasing and must determine that value by assuming that if the house were sold on the open market it would be subject to a secure tenancy, for example. That will inevitably reduce the price for the sale of the house and that is particularly bad because the house is being sold subject not to a secure tenancy but to an assured tenancy. The provision has been inserted deliberately to reduce the cost of the house so that it is cheaper for a private sector landlord.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause also specifies that allowance must be made for remedial works that are necessary
	<br><blockquote><p>"to put the house into the state of repair required by the landlord's repairing obligations."</p></blockquote>
There are many houses, especially in Dundee, where councils are starved of cash and have been unable to spend the money that they wish on housing. Houses that require £15,000, £16,000 or £17,000 worth of repairs will have that amount subtracted from their price for private sector landlords. The Minister intends district councils to pay the private sector landlord for taking over houses and carrying out the modernisation programme. That is grossly unfair and could mean that some houses will be taken over by private sector landlords with a negative value—district councils will have to pay private landlords for taking those houses off their hands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
District councils cannot live up to their responsibilities because the Government have starved them of money. Dundee's housing convenor told the Minister on Friday that he could spend £53 million per year on upgrading housing stock in Dundee, but he gets nothing like that amount.

deliberately frustrate district councils seeking to carry out their obligations and then exploit the disatisfaction that that causes among tenants so as to transfer houses from district council stock into the private sector. That is regrettable. The Bill is disgraceful and shameful.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would have supported that, but the Government have taken a balanced approach to the problem. I want to comment on those tenants who wish to buy, about whom the Opposition do not appear to care. I understand that if one has a house with a market value of £20,000 and a discount of 50 percent., that means a price of £10,000 to the tenant. If the improvements over the previous five years amount to £10,000, that does not affect the tenants discount. I hope that that is a clear view of the proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is my hon. Friend the Minister considering giving advice to tenants who have not yet applied to purchase their houses and who consider that they may be affected by the provisions that he has announced today? Those tenants will not know what the outstanding debt is on their houses because it is difficult to establish the figures for outstanding debt, especially if there is a complication of capital sales in part. That is why the Scottish Office is to change to the simpler system that my hon. Friend the Minister announced today. Tenants may wonder whether they should apply now or wait until the announcement made by my hon. Friend the Minister is translated into legislation, which will not be for some months. Tenants may be worred that an application made before the legislation is implemented may jeopardise their position and may not be the best action for them to take. They would have imperfect knowledge and not be aware of the exact figures. Will my hon. Friend the Minister consider giving guidance to tenants?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the housing authorities involved be able to implement the provisions immediately if they wish? That issue was raised particularly by Irvine new town development corporation, which has a substantial number of recently built houses. People there have identified that as a major restriction on sales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arguments are substantially different in relation to the provisions of clause 53. Perhaps I may be allowed a codicil to the previous debate. It would help the implementation of the new announcement if the Minister said that the Government intended to bring in the provisions as soon as the Bill became law. If there is no delay it will lead to difficulties for some local authorities, but if the Minister offered some guidance about when the provisions were to be enacted, it would avoid doubt.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assume that the amendment about which the Minister has been talking will be introduced on Report and not in another place. When the dust has settled and we have the opportunity to study today's proceedings, we could then have another bite at the cherry. Amendments Nos. 504, 505, 528 and 529, which stand in my name, are still applicable. Perhaps the Minister could wrap up this debate by explaining the Government's attitude to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Doran 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is an important principle behind the amendments, which has been torpedoed by the Minister's statement. The Committee has had difficulty in assessing the impact of the Bill and the amendments made to it, including the Minister's statement, because of the absence of facts and reliable statistics. We have been dealing with mistaken assumptions about the effect on the market if various encouragements are removed and so on. While my colleagues were speaking, I took the trouble to try to work out the impact of the Minister's statement and the amendments from the Scottish Development Department's latest statistical bulletin, which arrived in the post this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would block the Minister's proposal. He proposes to remove the limitations imposed under section 62 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 and particularly those undere section 62(7), which make special provision for houses first let after 31 December 1978. That would immediately affect 26,093 public sector houses, which is a substantial number. I do not know the average building cost of those houses. Only the Minister could give us that figure and so far he has not been very good at giving us figures. For the record, I took the figure of 26,093, from the Government's table of completed new dwellings. They are all local authority, new town or SSHA houses built between 1979–82. In the same category are houses on which improvements that have been significant enough to warrant borrowing consent and reporting to the Department have been carried out. There are 70,899 such houses. That makes a total of about 100,000 houses which would immediately be affected. I should not have had to search for that figure. It is background material that the Minister should have provided to enable us to decide what the impact of the changes will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister put the figures into cost terms? What was the average building cost of houses in
	<span class='label label-info column'>1122</span>
1979–82? What proportion of the newer houses has been sold or is likely to be sold? They are presumably more desirable and valuable and will sell quickly. What will be the net effect on the local authority, which will have to pick up the tab? I am not sure of the financing arrangements, but I think that the Minister suggested that the Government would make allowance for local authorities' extra costs. The proposal is a political measure and the Government should recompense local authorities, which were encouraged to invest in houses and modernisation but will be left with a huge debt. I am particularly anxious to ensure that the debt should not be shared among the remaining tenants, the Government should accept that they have a responsibility. I should like the Minister to reassure me and those who decide to remain public authority tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends the Members for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) and for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) referred to yet another attack on public authority housing. We have tried for several weeks to work out the logic behind apparently illogical legislation, which I am convinced will be damp squib. The provision is further evidence of the Government's attack on public housing. Even though the Government might think that it will encourage local authorities to build and modernise, it will in fact act as a disincentive against them improving and adding to their housing stock. It is difficult to escape the conclusion that that is deliberate Government policy. Local government's inability to spend money to bring housing up to standard, modernise and meet tenants' legitimate demands will force people who are, and would have liked to remain, local authority tenants to go into the market place, seek landlords and relinquish the rights given to them under .the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987. If it is deliberate Government policy, why do they not have the courage to say so? Why do they mask it in little charades of daily press conferences and the obscure terminology of the Bill? If you want to demolish Scottish housing, just do it. Do not wrap it up in the tinsel and gloss of improving tenants' rights. Have the courage of your convictions and admit that you are taking away tenants' rights.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I should not want to challenge that, at least not in this Room. I was referring collectively to the Government, but the point was well made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister directed us to the terms of the White Paper, which is specific about what the Government intend to do. Paragraph 3(11) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"One aspect of the right to buy which continues to obstruct sales, and is seen by many tenants as arbitary and unfair, is the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0696">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1123</span>
outstanding debt rule. This deprives many tenants of houses provided or improved after 1978 of their normal discount entitlement by requiring them to pay a price related to the money borrowed by their landlord to provide or improve the house. The Government propose that this exception to the normal discount rules should be discontinued."</p></blockquote>
So I cannot argue that the Government have not given us fair warning that this was intended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister made his statement this morning I searched through the Bill in vain to find the provisions that are to be removed. I looked at the schedules to see whether clauses 62 to 67 are to be repealed, but found nothing. Perhaps the Minister will direct me to the right place, because there does not seem to be any such provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why did the Minister wait until the last day to bounce this on us? When the White Paper was published last summer the Government were well aware of their intentions, yet there are no signs of any amendments to the substantive provisions of clause 62.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, why are English local authorities to be given longer—eight years—in which to repay their debt commitment and plan ahead for potential sales? Why are Scottish local authorities to be restricted to five years? Those are serious points and I look forward to hearing the Minister's reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, in reply to the comments of the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran), we waited because we were considering representations arising from the White Paper. We listened to the views expressed and have been flexible about them. We believe that this is a sensible compromise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked why the situation was different from that in England. The answer is that it has been different for many years. The cut-off date at present for Scottish outstanding debt is 31 December 1978. In England it is March 1974, so there was a considerable discrepancy in dates long before the statement today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the justification for retaining the distinction?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We do not have to do everything exactly the same as in England. The hon. Gentleman has made speech after speech saying that we are borrowing the ways of the English yet now, when we show some initiative, he does not want us to go our own way. The hon. Gentleman is a Scottish lawyer like myself and he will agree that the requirements of the Scottish legal system are sometimes different. Having taken all the circumstances into account, the Government believe that what we have done is fair. I was asked whether an amendment will be tabled on Report: it will. Furthermore, we intend to implement the provisions at the commencement of the Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths) raised the question of the right to buy sales. Our assessment is that the decisive majority of sales will continue to be at prices well above outstanding debt. Most council houses were built well before
	<span class='label label-info column'>1124</span>
1983. There is little or no chance of any house built before, say, 1975 being sold for less than the outstanding debt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) suggested that tenants would get a bigger discount after five years. That is true, but the market value will have gone up and the vast majority of properties sold will not be at a price below the outstanding debt. I have already said that this is a compromise. The hon. Gentleman also said that there was a need for a cost floor. I agree that there is no chance that the debt will be fully redeemed, but I have explained that the housing support grant system will ensure that remaining tenants will not face substantial rent increases. My hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) said that that was a balanced approach to the problem, and I believe that we have gone a long way to meeting the point about retaining a five-year cost floor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We intend to introduce a provision in the Bill that will oblige local authorities to inform tenants moving into a house if the cost floor is likely to restrict their discount, and we shall mount a publicity campaign. I was asked whether housing authorities could implement a five-year cost floor now. They could apply for voluntary consent to sell at less than the price to be realised under the right-to-buy provisions now in force. Clearly, applications will be considered on their merits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the amendments to which the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) eventually spoke.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position under the tenants' choice provisions in the Bill, and under the right to buy provisions are not wholly analogous. In the right to buy, because the house is sold into owner-occupation, the price set is the market value with vacant possession. To this price is applied a discount, which is calculated according to the tenant's own tenancy record. In tenants' choice, however, where the house will continue to be tenanted after transfer, the price, quite logically, will be market value subject to tenancy. No discounts are involved, so there is no discount to restrict and no logical reason for a higher sale price than that set by the district valuer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been argued that one should not dispose of property without realising at least enough from the sale to extinguish any debt attaching to the property. That argument fails to take into account the costs involved in managing and maintaining the property in good order. What is important is not the debt outstanding on the house, but the flow of rental income against expenditure on management and maintenance costs. Those flows will be taken into account by the district valuer in his "market value subject to tenancy" calculation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In circumstances where costs exceed rent income, the public sector landlord, by transferring a property, will be divesting itself of an obligation. It is something of a red herring to seek to impose any requirement that the price realised should in such cases meet the amount of loan to be repaid. For those reasons I cannot accept the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0697">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1125</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) returns to the fray for the conclusion of this extraordinary debate, I must point out that the Minister has let the cat out of the bag. He confirmed that the majority of local authority houses are considerably older than the five-year threshold and the rate of inflation in recent years means that the local authority will not be adversely affected by the removal of the cost floor. However, that means that any newer house sold will certainly be adversely affected by the removal of the cost floor, even after five years. Any house with substantial outstanding loan charges, either because it is newly built or has been comprehensively modernised, will almost inevitably be sold for substantially less than the money recently spent on it by the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has confirmed that the effect of the Government's action announced today is that any local authority that is rash enough to borrow money to spend on upgrading houses to a modern standard, or on building new houses, is running a risk that within five years that property may be sold off for substantially less than the local authority has invested in it. The Minister is telling local authorities that they will be ill-advised to build any new houses or to upgrade, at any substantial cost, their existing housing stock. That means that we shall be left with ghettoes of property that are not properly renovated. That is disgraceful and the Minister must stand condemned for aggravating such a state of affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister trotted out the old chestnut used in earlier debates that just because a house has been sold off it has not been taken out of the neighbourhood and that the sitting tenant has merely become the owner-occupier. He has conveniently overlooked the fact that that house will never, never, never be relet to another tenant on the local authority waiting list.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Fairbairn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Perth and Kinross)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that he did not want to overstate his case, but he said "never" three times. For all we know, the chap who buys the house will decide that he is buying it to let it.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point that the legislation would make that possible. However, he is deluding himself if he thinks that the sort of tenancies and rents that would apply in such circumstances would be of any use to the vest majority of people on the local authority housing waiting lists in our respective constituencies. He is not living in the real world.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At my surgery on Saturday there were dozens of people who would give their right arms to be able to rent a house privately, because they cannot rent from the local authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The price does not stop them renting—the absence of houses for rent does.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1126</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Exactly, and clearly local authorities are currently the most satisfactory source of rented housing in Scotland, by almost universal acceptance. They can provide housing at fair rents with secure tenancies. That will be more graphically visible in future. Local authority rents will be substantially lower, and the security will be substantially higher than in the private sector. Are Conservative Members suggesting that the proposals are likely to lead to people buying their council houses to let them to people on the housing waiting lists? Even Conservative Members cannot believe that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not overlook the fact that a significant number of people who buy their council houses find that they cannot afford the costs of owner-occupation. That is distressing. In my constituency, I come across a significant number of people who have bought their council houses and who subsequently find that, perhaps through unemployment or illness, they can no longer afford to pay the mortgage and the other home-ownership costs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am on the point of concluding, Mr. Martin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The mortgage is foreclosed and people find themselves again on the housing waiting list. It is a bit much for a local authority, which has been required to sell off the house at a fraction of the cost, to find that the same person who has taken advantage of that provision comes back onto the housing waiting list, or becomes homeless and has to be housed as a priority. The Minister is not living in the real world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has made a cruel announcement today, and it spells considerable hardship for a significant number of people who already experience hardship in Scotland. I am far from happy about the announcement, but it is up to the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) to decide what to do with his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no wish to prolong the agony. The Committee wants to make progress, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 552, in page 33, leave out lines 7 and 8.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 561, in page 33, line 7, leave out

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is intended to quell the implications of clause 53 (6)(a) about the value of a house being sold with a sitting tenant. One of the assumptions in determining the market value of a house sold under the landlord lucky dip system,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0698">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1127</span>
which that we have discussed, is that the house is sold with a sitting tenant. When market value is determined, the sitting tenant will still be a secure tenant with a set of rights under the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987, including the right to buy, and rights of succession. What are the financial implications for the value of the house? It will presumably be valued on the basis of a secured tenant occupying it, with all those rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Presumably, the existence of a secured tenancy at the point of valuation will reduce the valuation of the house. However, once the house is valued and sold, the secure tenant immediately becomes an assured tenant. Can we assume that the value of a house occupied by an assured tenant will be more than that of one occupied by a secure tenant? That stands to reason. Assured tenants will not have security, the rent will be higher, and the tenant will no longer have the right to buy with discount. It stands to reason that the house will have more capital value to the landlord because the assured tenant will have less security of tenure and fewer rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That being the case, the new landlord will realise an instant capital gain on the value of his property as soon as the transfer of the house occurs, and the secured tenant becomes an assured tenant. That could create an incentive for the landlord to realise his capital gain by reselling the property quickly, with the sitting tenant still in it. The landlord could make an immediate profit because the valuation of the property will then take into account the limited security of his assured tenant, and will be higher than the original price he paid for the property when it was occupied by a secured tenant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Shelter appreciate that an approved landlord could dispose of the property only with the consent of Scottish Homes. However, the Bill does not outline the criteria on which Scottish Homes will base its decision to consent to a resale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is anxiety that clause 53(6)(a) may be open to exploitation by property speculators. Shelter would like some clarification about that, and information about the likely financial consequences for the valuation of property sold with a secured tenant occupant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already made the point that that mechanism will create a windfall gain for those landlords who succeed in acquiring property under the provision. We should higlight that, and we seek information about the consideration that the Government have given to the matter. Have they considered extra taxation, for example? There is also the question of onward sales. Under what circumstances will Scottish Home consent to the resale of property after it has been acquired under part III?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 561 deals with the same point, and has been drafted by the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government must deal with the question of the windfall gain which will be made under the legislation by the acquiring landlord.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On windfall gains, receiving landlords will not be able to sell property
	<span class='label label-info column'>1128</span>
acquired under Part III without the approval of Scottish Homes. Clause 60 safegaurds against that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman's arguments for amendments Nos. 552 and 561. The first of the amendments would remove completely the guidance proposed in clause 53(6)(A) that district valuers should include, in the assumptions they take into account in determining the value of a property under the provisions, the fact that the property is being sold subject to the form of tenancy held by the qualifying tenant—that is a secure tenancy—but otherwise with vacant possession. We have been reluctant to impose too detailed a list of factors which valuers should take into account when carrying out their responsibilities. We have tried to avoid being too prescriptive. However, I believe that the provisions contained in clause 53(6)(A), and elsewhere in that subsection, are necessary and will be of assistance to district valuers. Therefore, I am not willing to accept amendment No. 552.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While amendment No. 561 would keep in the bill guidance on the tenancy factor to be taken into account on valuation of property transferring under the tenants' choice provisions, it also proposes that valuation should be based on the type of tenancy to be established following transfer, rather than at the point of transfer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider what that would mean. The district valuer would have to value a house on the basis of its market value subject to a tenancy whose terms he would not know. That is because the assured tenancy, which will be created if the transfer takes place, will be on terms and conditions which can be finalised only after the sale price of the property is known. Rents, for example, will be negotiable between the tenant and his prospective new landlord, who will want to ensure that he can make an acceptable return on his investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would therefore be impracticable for the Bill to be amended as the hon. Gentleman has suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Earlier the Minister said that a transaction under this provision could not be completed until the new lease had been negotiated. Up to that point the tenant would be able to block the transaction. The Minister is trying to have it both ways. He is now saying that the district valuer will not know the terms of the new lease until after the transaction has been completed and the transaction will have to be completed before the new tenancy can be created. What does he mean?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, arrangements have to be formalised by a lease. In determining market value, that must be an early part of the procedure to be followed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to make a meal of this matter. This was intended to be a probing amendment. The Committee has established without doubt that a property with an insecure tenancy will have a substantially higher capital value than a property in the public sector with a sitting secured tenant. The Minister has acknowledged that fact.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0699">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1129</span>
Who will get the benefit of that windfall increase in valuation? The Minister has tacitly confirmed that the acquiring landlord will get the benefit of the substantial increase in the value of the property as a direct result of this legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is shameful and we shall return to this matter because people in Scotland will be interested to know about the incentives that the Government are giving to speculator landlords in the Bill. We have come to expect that sort of thing, but we do not often come across such a blatant example as this. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It is unrealistic to assume that only the prospective purchasers are in the market for the house and that competition on the open market would not result in a higher transfer value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As currently drafted, the clause is inconsistent with comparable council house sales legislation which assumes an element of competition—I refer to section 62 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987. The district valuer will have to set an artificially low valuation, which will generate a windfall for the acquiring landlord. If the district valuer took into account the fact that only a limited number of approved acquiring landlordss were in the market—only one or two in some neighbourhoods—the scope for operating a price ring and talking down the valuation of property could be extensive. Will the Minister offer safeguards against such bad practice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment raises the question of whether properties will be undervalued in a thin market. The hon. Gentleman was worried that property might be undervalued, especially at the outset of tenants' choice before many landlords are approved as receiving landlords. I hope that I can convince the hon. Gentleman that his concern is unfounded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, very few landlords would have to be approved for there to be too few for the valuer to envisage bidding between them. Even if only one applicant had been approved, or the only applicant in the running were Scottish Homes, the valuer's professional expertise and technique would allow him to provide a valid market value by assessing the capital value of the flow of rents against the costs of management, maintenance and repairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government amendment No. 582 is a technical amendment to ensure that the interests of all landlords eligible to acquire property under the tenants' choice provisions are taken into account by the district valuer when determining the price of the property to be acquired. Scottish Homes is an
	<span class='label label-info column'>1130</span>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would rather he did not. Our fears are perfectly legitimate. If he could answer yes or no to one simple point, I shall withdraw the amendment.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Scottish Homes will certainly monitor the situation. If the hon. Gentleman will give me notice of that question, I shall give him an answer later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take it that Scottish Homes, as a quango, a nominated body, will be subject to scrutiny by the Public Accounts Committee and the Comptroller and Auditor General.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am almost certain that, given the aspects of the Bill that we have highlighted, abuses will come to light and individual private landlords will make significant windfall gains by taking advantage of the loopholes in the legislation. I would rather that the Minister had made a better job of the legislation to start with, but he clearly has no intention of even trying. At least he has confirmed that the Public Accounts Committee and the Comptroller and Auditor General, or whatever public official is responsible for vetting these affairs, will monitor what is going on and submit a report to Parliament.

	<p>No. 555, in page 33, line 25, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(c) They shall include such terms as are necessary to ensure that, where the market value of the house has been determined on the assumption contained in (6)(d) above that the applicant will carry out necessary works to repair the house, the applicant will carry out such works within a stated period of time.".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 280 would strike out subsection (6)(d). Under the clause, local authority housing may be transferred to a landlord in such a poor condition that the market value is especially low and a considerable amount of repair work is necessary to fulfill the landlord's obligations. Consequently, the local authority may not receive sufficient moneys to cover the loan debt or other outstanding debts on the property and the tenants who remain within the local authority or the housing association lumbered with the burden of servicing the outstanding debt on the transferred property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In amendment No. 281 we seek to make paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection (8) stand alone. That is to say that the conditions must not:
	<br><blockquote><p>"reduce the tenant's enjoyment and use of the house as tenant of the applicant"</p></blockquote>
or as opposed to the Bill, which says "and"—
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall include such terms as are necessary to entitle the applicant to receive a good and marketable title to the house."</p></blockquote>
We believe that either condition should be necessary, not both.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 282 seeks to add an extra paragraph, (c), which would:
	<br><blockquote><p>"include a condition that the applicant shall, within a reasonable period carry out such works as are reasonably necessary to put the house into the state of repair required by the Landlord's repairing obligations."</p></blockquote>
Amendments Nos. 281, 282 and 555 are designed to ensure that landlords cannot run off with the money and leave tenants with houses that are not in a good state of repair. Amendment No. 555 would include a time scale in the clause of:
	<br><blockquote><p>"a stated period of time."</p></blockquote>
We do not stipulate what would be a reasonable period of time. However, we suggest that because the conditions of houses will vary depending on the level of repairs necessary, some time scale should be included in the Bill so that the applicant, the local authority and the tenant are aware of it. It must be a reasonable period of time so that a local authority or any one else cannot make an unreasonable condition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no guarantee in the clause that, when the tenant transfers to a new landlord, work will be done within any time scale. We wish to incorporate a time scale and that is the impact of the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With amendment No. 280, hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths) seeks to remove from the factors to be taken into account by the district valuer, when determining the value of a property, the assumption that a prospective landlord will put in hand, within a reasonable period, works necessary to bring the property up to a reasonable standard. I believe that the Bill should guide district valuers in their task of assessing the value to be attached to property transferred under the provisions, without being too
	<span class='label label-info column'>1132</span>
prescriptive. That is a delicate balance to strike, but I believe that the condition in clause 53(6)(d) is sensible. Why should a local authority receive a price on transfer that does anything else than fully reflect the current state of the house that it is transferring? We should make it clear that the prospective landlord will be expected to carry out necessary improvement works in early course, and that the property has been valued to reflect the extent of expenditure that a new landlord will have to incur to meet the cost of those works. Of course, where a property has been well maintained, the cost of improvement works will not have any significant effect on the valuation of the property. I believe that it is only fair both to tenant and prospective landlord that valuation assumptions should pave the way for an early start to the necessary repair works.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have also noted what has been said in support of the other amendments in this group. Amendments Nos. 282 and 555 would make it a condition in every instance that the prospective landlord should effect, within a reasonable or a stated period, any repairs necessary to bring the property to be transferred up to a reasonable standard. Of course, I hope and believe that landlords will make every effort to improve the quality of the stock that they take over. I do not believe, however, that it is necessary to enshrine such conditions in statute. Paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection (8) contain provisions to protect the interest of the tenant and to ensure that the new landlord receives a valid title to the property. These I see as fundamental to the transfer, but the legislation leaves open the possibility that other conditions may be included in the offer to sell. I believe, that that is the correct course to follow and all that is necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that, on reflection, the hon. Gentleman will agree that parties should be able to determine themselves the conditions to be attached to a sale of property. Therefore, I hope that he will not press the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not reassured by what the Minister says, particularly in relation to amendment No. 555. Those of us who have experience of housing problems in inner city areas know that private landlords do not have a good record in making repairs to houses. That is usually reflected in the rent assessors valuation of the property. We seek to ensure that properties in need of repairs are not left to deteriorate further when they are transferred and that if extensive repairs are needed, they are carried out within a reasonable period of time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to strengthen and extend landlords' repairing obligations. We do not feel that the Bill does enough to compel landlords who wish to drag their feet to press ahead with repairs. There may be many reasons for landlords to drag their feet. They may have spent all their savings or borrowed to purchase the property and left themselves short of money for repairs. That sort of excuse may be acceptable to a tenant for a short period; it will probably be acceptable to someone who is homeless and is desperate to find accommodation. Plenty of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0701">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1133</span>
people in Edinburgh have been so desperate for housing that they have had to accept private rented accommodation in a dreadfull condition, so I am assessing the problem realistically. We wish to make sure that landlords do not over-reach themselves financially, but instead have enough reserves to tackle necessary repairs within a reasonable period. That will deter landlords from going for quantity rather than quality and from buying up as much as they can and deferring major repairs or even ordinary repairs and maintenance until it is too late to rectify damage through neglect. That happens quite often in housing owned by private landlords in inner city areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 555 will ensure that landlords know that they have to set aside enough money or borrowing power to carry out repairs within a reasonable time and do not fob off tenants with the excuse that they do not have enough money for repairs. However, I have consulted my colleagues and agreed not to press the amendment. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

and new clause 5—	<i>Nomination of tenants</i>—
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where public sector or houses built with public funds are transferred under the provisions of Part III of this Act, the local authority (district or islands council) shall retain a right to nominate tenants from its waiting list to a proportion of those houses to be prescribed.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would allow the public sector landlord to have as a condition of sale to an applicant certain rights of nomination to the property acquired.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we all recognise that a local authority will continue to have statutory responsibilities towards those with housing needs, and will continue to satisfy those needs, whether providing housing from its own stock or ensuring that housing is provided by other landlords, such as housing associations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many tenants and local authorities will travel hopefully under the new Scottish Homes regime, but that hope may not always become reality. The amendment would allow local authorities to lay down some rights of nomination on the properties acquired from them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities will lose houses, but some nomination right should prevail thereafter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We recognise that nomination rights may reduce the initial value of a house being transferred to a new landlord, but amendment No. 553 does not give
	<span class='label label-info column'>1134</span>
a housing authority any absolute right over other landlords or the control of allocations. It simply seeks certain rights of nomination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 539 deals with the same principle, as does new clause 5. The proposals deal with the special needs of elderly people, homeless people and those who are economically mobile and move around in the housing market. It is important that public sector landlords have some involvement with the new housing agencies such as Scottish Homes or any other approved landlord and can, after consultation, lay down nomination rights for the good of the communities served by that housing stock.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I noted the arguments of the hon. Member for East Kilbride (Mr. Ingram) in favour of nomination rights. The proposals seek to allow some form of nomination rights by local authority landlords over stock transferred under the tenant's choice provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The suggestion is that offers to sell should include conditions allowing authorities to nominate persons from their own waiting list to the tenancies of stock which transfers in this way. I must remind hon. Members that under the tenants' choice provisions we are dealing with individual transfers of tenanted property, and not with block transfers where some of the houses might be vacant. There are other provisions in current legislation which allow authorities, with the approval of the Secretary of State, to dispose of blocks of housing stock, and such disposals may be agreed with conditions covering nomination rights. I repeat that the provisions are based on individual transfers of tenanted property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be open to a new landlord to dispose of property acquired in that way, with the consent of Scottish Homes. Clause 60 deals specifically with that point. That disposal could take place without any requirement that the property should continue to be let. Scottish Homes might decide that certain properties are suitable for owner-occupation. In such circumstances, nomination rights would not be relevant or practicable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree to withdraw the amendment and the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the Minister has answered my points. Although the legislation allows individual choice about letting houses, none the less they could fall vacant later and would be available in the overall housing stock of a particular area. In those circumstances, the local housing agency should nominate people for those houses from its waiting list.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to overstress the point, but housing waiting lists are considerable in all housing areas in Scotland. By no stretch of the imagination will the amendment solve that problem. We need to build new houses, not just recycle the ones already there. None the less, as houses will in a sense, go out of the public sector stock, it would be useful if local authorities had some nomination rights regarding those houses remaining in the overall housing stock.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This underlines one of the problems that the Minister is creating. There are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0702">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1135</span>
about 200,000 people on housing waiting lists in Scotland. In our constituency work, many of us come face to face with a number of those people on a regular basis. The Minister should be aware how tragic and distressing it is for people in overcrowded accommodation who are waiting for housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is going to great lengths to reduce the amount of local authority housing stock, thus reducing the ability of local authorities to meet those unfortunate people's needs. As he is piloting this important legislation through, presumably, he has thought about its effect on housing in Scotland. My hon. Friend the Member for East Kilbride (Mr. Ingram) has made an important proposal. It deals with the problem of relating the need for rented housing with the rented housing available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will not necessarily be blocks of housing that get sold off, but individual properties, dotted around all over the place. When a property becomes available for reletting—if the landlord is prepared to relet it—how on earth will people who have been waiting patiently, or not so patiently, for suitable housing for months, years, or decades be made aware that there is a house available? How can we ensure that they will get fair consideration and a fair opportunity to rent that house?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My own local authority has at last transferred, rather painfully, into using a points system for allocating district council housing. The system has certain shortcomings, but at least it is seen to be fair. On the rare occasions that a house becomes available, it is allocated to the person who has the greatest need and has been waiting the longest. The proposed set-up will mean a capricious system. The landlord who owns the property will be able to let it to whoever he likes. Indeed, he will not be compelled to let it—he can leave it standing empty or, as the Minister pointed out, sell if off for owner-occupation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the absence of a nomination facility, how does the Minister anticipate that the 200,000 people in Scotland currently stuck on housing waiting lists will be able to find those houses that will become available to let in dribs and drabs up and down the country?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is seeking to widen this into a debate on waiting lists. As he well knows, when people want a house, they may put their name on several waiting lists. Whatever the number of names on a waiting list, a person may have applied to more than one. There is a safeguard in clause 60 which requires Scottish Homes to give consent for subsequent disposals. I expect the new agency to take that obligation seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nomination rights at present are non-statutory. They involve local authorities and other landlords, usually housing associations, and normally allow the allocation of a proportion of stock to local authority housing applicants. We do not need statutory arrangements for tenants' choice landlords. The proposals in the amendments do not make sense with regard to individual transfers of tenanted housing under the provisions of part III of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1136</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is getting worse. The Minister is dispersing the ownership of let housing. He has acknowledged that numerous people are waiting for houses. How will the 3,000 or 4,000 people on waiting lists in East Lothian find out when a private sector house is available to rent, and how can they be sure of being fairly considered for it in the absence of nomination rights? Have the Government given any thought to the way in which landlords with housing available to let can be co-ordinated with the people who urgently need to rent housing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I make the general point that there is no bar to drawing up non-statutory agreements on a nomination agreement if an acquiring landlord finds that he has a number of vacant houses. The hon. Gentleman asks what he can tell tenants on a waiting list. Most of the tenants who come to my surgery complain because they want to transfer within the public sector from one council house to another but they have to wait depending on the number of points that they have. The purpose of the Bill is to bring more housing into the private rented sector, but that is not relevant to the issue of nomination rights.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In other words, the Minister does not have a clue?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will people want to transfer within the housing market to the same extent as they do now when instead of secure tenancies they will have only assured or short assured tenancies? The Minister must be living in a fantasy world if he thinks that people will transfer to the private sector willingly, but people will do so in desperation. Dozens of people already turn up at a Member's surgery demanding a house in either the public or the private sector. That shows that people are desperate because of the shortage of houses. In my constituency, a large number of people are buying houses, and the waiting lists are growing. Any house that goes on to the open market does not necessarily satisfy the housing demand, because people can buy into the desirable areas. The housing authority loses a house from the housing stock and the waiting lists grow accordingly. The new housing regime may well exacerbate the situation. A straightforward request is made through the amendment to protect the right of people who are already on the waiting list.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: According to the Government's notes on clauses, subsection (10):
	<br><blockquote><p>"prevents the landlord from imposing a condition in the offer to sell requiring any of his expenses to be met by the applicant".</p></blockquote>
Amendment No. 521 comes from Dundee district council and has nothing to do with imposing conditions upon applicants, which would constitute a wrecking amendment to frustrate efforts to buy council property. The district council wants housing authorities to have the option of charging commercial bodies for administrative costs. If the Government's policy is successful, a high level of applications will be made from the private sector to take over district council houses. In those circumstances, considerable administrative costs will be incurred for the various transactions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The commercial bodies will be private sector landlords who have already been given substantial public sector subsidies from the Government. They will have been able to take over housing below its true market value. The assured and short assured tenancy provisions will allow them to impose higher rents and make it easier for them to evict tenants and obtain vacant possession. A new housing agency, Scottish Homes, will channel scarce resources into joint projects with private sector landlords and public sector money will subsidise the projects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments simply say that business transactions should not be paid for by the ratepayers. The clause deals with the way in which private sector landlords can get their paws on public sector property. The Minister says that the administrative costs involved will be borne by the ratepayer and not by the private sector landlord who is thereby given a significant advantage. He should make a contribution to those costs and should not be subsidised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion). Among the more substantial costs that local authorities had to meet as a result of the right to buy legislation were legal costs, because each transaction required a separate conveyance and standard securities had to be checked. Local authorities also wanted their own standard security because of the five-year pre-emption provisions, so three sets of documents had to be scrutinised and local authority legal departments had to be expanded to cope with that, thus adding to the costs. I cannot speak for all Scottish local authorities, but I know that most are entitled to impose a routine charge on the tenant to cover part of the legal costs involved. The charge is not in the Law Society scale, but it reflects the local authority's costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (10) precludes local authorities from imposing legal costs on the applicant. That is unfair to the local authority because if numerous landlords make applications, although I do not think that they will, a substantial number of conveyances will take
	<span class='label label-info column'>1138</span>
place, perhaps even more than under the right to buy legislation. These are not sales of tenement properties, where the take-up rate has been much lower than for detached and semi-detached houses, but transfers of tenancies and landlords' rights of acquisition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill precludes local authorities from charging for the legal costs of the complex conveyances. These costs will not be taken into account by the district valuer's assessment of the value of a property. It is inequitable that the private purchaser—the local authority tenant—who exercises his right to buy may be charged legal expenses by the local authority while the costs of the speculative property developer will be met by the local authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should make it clear at the outset that the case of standard securities to which the hon. Gentleman referred would not apply in these circumstances. The amendments are not acceptable. Subsection (10) states merely that the selling landlord cannot require that his costs be met by either the applicant or the tenant. That is not unreasonable. The income from the sale of the properties under tenants' choice will normally be substantially higher than the administrative costs involved in their sale. It is only fair that all the parties concerned in carrying through a tenants' choice transaction should meet their own costs. I hope that the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) will agree to withdraw the amendment. If not, I must ask the Committee to reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister explain why he makes a distinction between landlords and those tenants who exercise the right to buy?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said very clearly that all parties concerned should pay their own costs when carrying through tenants' choice transactions because that is their obligation under the law.

	<span class='label label-info column'>1139</span>
main beneficiary from the transaction. Landlords are getting subsidised to get their hands on public property. The Minister is saying that the Government intend the administrative costs involved in the transaction to be borne by the ratepayers in the area in which the transaction takes place rather than by the private sector landlord who makes a profit from the transaciton. That is putting the interests of private sector landlords and profit-makers before those of the ratepayers and tenants of Scotland. That is dreadful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we are trying to make progress, we shall tackle the Minister again on that subject later. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 295, in page 33, line 32, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(11) All offers of sale made under this section shall contain a condition that the new owner shall be obliged to pay a proportionate share of the cost of maintaining or improving common property in a group of houses to which the house being sold belongs and which has been authorised by the owners of a majority of the houses in that group.'.</p></blockquote>
This amendment can be disposed of extremely quickly. If the Minister's experience is anything like mine it will suggest that there have been difficulties in getting improvements such as proper security systems and door entry systems in blocks of flats where individual flats have been disposed of under the right to buy legislation. A parallel and analogous situation could build up where, for example, tenancies were transferred in part within a block of flats and improvements or attempted improvements by the remaining tenants were blocked by the proprietors or new landlords of the properties and tenancies that had been transferred. It is not right that the people who have transferred the tenancies or responsibility for the property should be able to stop improvements that are wanted by the remainder, where, for example, the outstanding number of tenancies have stayed within the public sector. It is a small but important point. Have the Government given any thought to it? I am prepared to accept that the wording of the amendment is technically defective, but its spirit is worthy of consideration and I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman spoke about door entry systems and increased security, which obviously make properties in the public sector much more popular. I appreciate the sentiment behind his amendment, that new landlords should be required to meet a share of the costs of carrying out agreed works to a property in those circumstances where there is more than one owner, for example, in a block of flats.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 53 makes provision for conditions to be attached to the offer to sell and requires such conditions to be reasonable. The legislation refers specifically to the requirement that any conditions attached should
	<br><blockquote><p>"not reduce the tenant's enjoyment and use of the house as tenant".</p></blockquote>
It is for the new landlord to make sure in his negotiations that he obtains the necessary rights to
	<span class='label label-info column'>1140</span>
achieve this. The other side of the coin is that the local authority can and will impose the corresponding obligations to go with those rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fully expect that local authorities will take the opportunity to make it a condition of transfer that the new landlord should meet a proportion of the costs involved in the upkeep and maintenance of common facilities. I believe, however, that it is for parties in individual cases to decide the range of conditions to be attached to the offer to sell, rather than have a list of conditions prescribed in statute. That is normal conveyancing practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have noted the views expressed by the hon. Gentlemen in support of the amendment but I believe that it is sufficient to rely on the provisions to attach reasonable conditions to an offer to sell, and that the amendment is unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is fine as far as it goes, but the Minister will know that individuals who are engaged in such transactions and perfectly properly looking after their own interests—and can, I guess, be left happily and safely to do so—do not often think about the common parts of a flatted building or a tenement building. There are important points still to be considered and I am not sure that the Government have considered and dealt with them properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am still puzzled about how the proportion or the apportionment of the costs of repairs in the common parts of a tenement building will be distributed after the abolition of the domestic rating system. As the Minister knows, the well-tried and established formula has always been that people take a share of the cost of roof repairs, new door entry systems, and so on, based on the apportionment of their rateable value. I raise that matter in parenthesis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not press the amendment to a Division. I hear what the Minister says, but has he given proper consideration to whether tenants who have their tenancies transferred will know enough about the matter to consider the future of the common parts of tenement buildings and flatted properties?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would expect that to be a matter on which Scottish Homes will give guidance and I would expect local authorities to write the conditions into the lease.

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had some interesting debates on amendments to clause 53, including the digression into the question of the cost floor in relation to another piece of legislation. The acquiring landlord will receive many interesting
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0705">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1141</span>
rights. He will also have access to substantial windfall gains with precious little benefit flowing either to the tenant or to the public sector landlord who is to have his housing stock taken away. We have established that the tenant will not be directly involved in the process, so for the Government to describe it as tenants' choice is singularly inappropriate. The tenant can extricate himself from the process if it gets going, but his choice is extremely limited. The clause is entitled:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Application to exercise rights conferred by this Part and offer to sell."</p></blockquote>
The application is not made by the tenant but by the acquiring landlord—the private sector landlord—who wants to amass housing stock on the cheap by raiding the public sector housing stock through this mechanism. This is not a tenants' choice—it is a lucky dip system for speculative landlords which they will be able to use with considerable ease and which will bring them substantial gains. The tenants have to grant their initial consent, although we have yet to gain assurances that the tenant will be actively involved in the process and aware of what is going on. We shall return to that on a group of amendments on the next clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to refer briefly to subsection (8)(a). It reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"An offer to sell under this section may be under such conditions as are reasonable, provided that—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(a) they shall not reduce the tenant's enjoyment and use of the house as tenant of the applicant from that which he had as tenant of the landlord".</p></blockquote>
That cannot be so because in moving from the public sector to the private sector the tenant will be signing away his right to a secure tenancy and to fair rents and implicitly taking on for himself and his family the future risk of eviction under the assured tenancy system. That subsection is sheer humbug. One wonders how tenants can continue to enjoy the same quality of tenancy when the tenancy has been quite deliberately devalued by the Government. This is a dangerous mechanism. Tenants should be warned of the risks to which they are exposing themselves if they endorse an application under this mechanism. The clause should not stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In relation to subsection (8)(a), if a tenant transfers to Scottish Homes he will still be a public sector tenant and will have exactly the same rights as a secure tenant has at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That does not go for the others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, but it will be made clear what the rights are in the circumstances. The tenant has to be directly involved in the procedures. First, he has to agree to the first approach to the public sector landlord. Secondly, he has to agree to the lease before the sale can go ahead. Therefore the tenant plays a key role. Without the tenant's consent nothing can happen. As I mentioned earlier, clause 60 is the safeguard against windfall gains. Clause 53 sets out the detailed procedures for applications under tenants' choice and for issuing
	<span class='label label-info column'>1142</span>
offers to sell. It also describes the way in which transfer price is to be established, that is at market value subject to tenancy. The clause also covers conditions of sale.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirk wood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 530, in page 34, line 6, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(2A) A landlord shall have the right to appeal to the court of session if he believes the determination of the Lands Tribunal to be unreasonable.".</p></blockquote>
The amendment speaks for itself. When I read the parts of the Bill that deal with the rights of determination under the Lands Tribunal system it occurred to me that a landlord should have the right of appeal to the Court of Session if he believes the determination to be unreasonable. The Lands Tribunal is being given wide-ranging new powers. It could take over and conclude any negotiation which cannot be brought to a conclusion by agreement or, alternatively, any negotiation which is delayed through inaction. As far as I can see, no provision has been made for the landlord to appeal to anyone if the Lands Tribunal decision goes against him or he feels it is prejudicial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be worthwhile taking a moment to consider whether we know what we are doing, whether it is sensible and whether we should give an explicit right of appeal to the Court of Session in the situation that I have described. I should like to hear what the Minister has to say about it. The Government must have given some thought to these new powers, which are fairly wide ranging. We should not allow them to be passed willy nilly without some comment and discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is interesting, but in section 13 of the Tribunals and Inquiries Act 1971 there is provision for an appeal from the Lands Tribunal for Scotland to the Court of Session if any party to the proceedings before the tribunal is dissatisfied on a point of law with the tribunal's decision. I believe that that existing appeal arrangement is entirely adequate. I hope, therefore, that the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) will seek leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 540, in page 34, line 11, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(4) In considering whether to strike out or vary a condition, or include a new condition, the landlord shall have regard to any representations from qualifying tenants.".</p></blockquote>
The effect of the amendment would be to require the landlord to ensure that the concerns and wishes of tenants are taken into account before he agrees to make any changes or additions relating to his application. The amendment was suggested by the Scottish Consumer Council. It is consistent with the Government's repeated claims that the Bill will improve tenants' choice. It would oblige the landlord to listen to the tenant before matters are concluded and to take the wishes of the tenant into account by including conditions in the transfer of ownership to the applicant, or new landlord as I prefer to think of him. It is fairly straightforward and consistent with the Government's claim that the Bill will improve tenants' choice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with interest to the hon. Gentleman, but I do not believe that it is necessary to include such a duty in the statute. In considering the new conditions to be included in an offer-to-sell notice, the selling landlord may have regard to representations from other tenants who live in the area. But selling landlords would not welcome a statutory obligation to consider representations from any tenant in dealing with applications under tenants' choice. The amendment is not necessary or desirable and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will seek leave to withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To make progress, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>6.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 563, in page 34, line 11, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(4) Where an amended offer to sell is served upon the applicant, the qualifying tenant will be required to confirm his consent in writing prior to the service of a notice of acceptance.".</p></blockquote>
The amendment seeks to ensure that when the qualifying tenant is about to be served a notice of acceptance he will confirm his consent in writing. That would give anybody who is gulled by a landlord a chance to withdraw up to the last minute. The best way to satisfy the courts or any other arbiter is to ensure that consent is in writing prior to the service of a notice of acceptance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman's arguments in support of the amendment which would require the tenant's written agreement to an amended offer to sell before the prospective landlord can intimate his acceptance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members may have overlooked the fact that what is under negotiation at this point is the detail of a transaction between two landlords. The tenant's
	<span class='label label-info column'>1144</span>
position is already covered by the provisions of clause 53(8)(a), which will ensure that any conditions attached to an offer to sell will not reduce the tenant's enjoyment and use of the house. Further provision is made in clause 55(2) to protect the tenant's position in the sale, in that he must have agreed a conditional lease with the prospective landlord before the latter can serve a notice of acceptance. Those provisions adequately protect the interests of tenants in the matter of transfer, and therefore amendment No. 563 is not required. To require an additional reference to the tenant would merely delay matters unnecessarily and to no purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I invite the hon. Gentleman to seek leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the Minister has said about clause 53(8)(a) does not adequately cover the point that an additional subsection (4) in clause 54 would embrace—that is, to specify that at that stage in the transaction the tenant must put in writing his intention to avail himself of any offer from the landlord.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister also referred to clause 55(2). Again, although it requires the service on the tenant to be in writing, it does not require the tenant to write back to accept unequivocally. That is the key point. We know that correspondence will already have been exchanged, but at this stage a further letter is necessary from the tenant to confirm final agreement to the terms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have nothing to add to what I have already said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister did not say anything.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly did.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can only hope that the Minister's assurance that the amendment is unnecessary and already incorporated is good. In that spirit, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause deals with the variation of conditions for the acquisition of public property by a predatory landlord. Such an acquiring landlord, exercising rights granted under the clause, would have all the advantages. The tenant has certain residual rights to block the process, but the public sector landlord, who has all the duties connected with housing in Scotland, has only limited rights. Local authorities have virtually no way of safeguarding the interests of their tenants. The only way in which they can insist on better conditions for sitting tenants in the properties affected, or for the wider community with regard to the wider interests in housing in their area, is to try to impose different conditions on the transaction. The matter is then referred to the Lands Tribunal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister take the opportunity of saying a few words about the Lands Tribunal in that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0707">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1145</span>
connection? What is its status, and what relevant experience does it have in the area of conflicting interests? Indeed, who nominates the members of the Lands Tribunal? They have massive powers under the clause. The way in which they deal with cases that are referred to the Lands Tribunal by acquiring landlords could be immensely important to the interests of the predator landlord and to the rights and responsibilities of public sector landlords in the districts and islands areas of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is using the Lands Tribunal as the long stop to deal with any complaints or difficulties that may arise. He therefore owes it to the Committee to explain those circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I probably should have intervened on the previous amendment. This clause, again, pays little regard to tenants' rights. It requires the service of notices and of offers to sell and, in the event of a failure to agree, reference to the Lands Tribunal. That may be a lengthy process, which could impose conditions that would materially affect the tenant. I accept that clause 53 makes it clear that the tenant's enjoyment and use of the house must not be affected, but we are talking about a lengthy process from the time when the tenant gives his approval until the landlord and the applicant finally sort out the terms on which the property is to change hands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take an example that is not outwith the bounds of possibility. Nothing in the Bill would prevent the local authority in certain conditions. Such a clause would allow the property to revert back to the local authority in certain conditions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With a discount?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I very much doubt that there would be a discount. A landlord who wants sole negotiating rights in an area or housing scheme may be able to arrange a deal with the local authority. A local authority might be able to set up its own company for a similar purpose. Those are the possibilities that lawyers are paid to explore.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be unacceptable to the tenant for the local authority to become his landlord again by using a pre-emption clause. The tenant is given no say when the deal is finally concluded between the landlord and the applicant, despite the fact that the process may have taken months or even years by the time the case has gone through the Lands Tribunal and any appeal has been decided by the Court of Session. At no time is the tenant consulted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was asked a technical question about the Lands Tribunal. Section 50(1)(6) of the Conveyancing and Feudal Reform (Scotland) Act 1970 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The President shall be a person appearing to the Lord President of the Court of Session to be suitably qualified by the holding of judicial office or by experience as an advocate or solicitor, and of the other members of the Lands Tribunal such number as the Lord President of the Court of Session may determine shall be persons so qualified, and the others shall be persons who have had experience in the valuation of land appointed after consultation with the chairman of the Scottish Branch of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors."</p></blockquote>
Clearly those people will be thoroughly experienced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was a good thing that the Minister's civil servants brought that Act along.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank those assisting me for providing the information so speedily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In answer to the question asked by the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson), public sector landlords will receive the market price for the sale. The powers of the Lands Tribunal they will be similar to those under the right to buy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths) asked whether tenants would be informed of their future rights. The answer is that they certainly will be informed—by Scottish Homes. There is a pre-emption clause for the disabled under the right to buy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under clause 54 applicants can seek to vary the conditions that a landlord attaches to an offer to sell. The clause includes a right of referral to the Lands Tribunal for Scotland by the applicant if he wishes to dispute a condition, or if the landlord has not served an offer to sell within the required time period. It provides that the Lands Tribunal may make a Determination which may vary the offer if it thinks fit. The clause also sets out the relevant time scales which apply to that part of the procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can read the clause for myself, but I am worried that while all those wrangles and negotiations are going on between landlords and applicants the poor tenant will not know what is going on. He does not have to be consulted again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I have said, it would be the responsibility of Scottish Homes to inform tenants fully of their rights. I have no doubt that that will happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Scottish Homes will not be party to the negotiations between landlords and applicants. For example, if the City of Aberdeen district council is approached by an applicant, Scottish Homes may be neither involved nor informed. There is no requirement to seek the tenant and advise him. I am concerned about the individual tenant who may be affected by the result of negotiations between a landlord and an applicant but may have no knowledge of the negotiations. No one is required to tell him how the result of the negotiations will affect him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems unlikely that the applicant will not keep the tenant fully informed of the progress of the application. The landlord will have to be approved by Scottish Homes, so that body will be involved, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have established the exact degree of daftness into which the Government are leading us.

The Lands Tribunal, as the final arbiter of fair conditions, will have a heavy responsibility. I can think of many circumstances in which a pre-emption clause would be appropriate in the public interest. As my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) said, a public sector landlord may want to impose a right of pre-emption on properties and it will be up to the Lands Tribunal to decide whether that would be reasonable. We shall watch the performance of the Lands Tribunal closely if this unfortunate piece of legislation ever hits the statute book, as seems all too likely. I hope that the Lands Tribunal will be able to do its job and protect the public interest, but I have my doubts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 585, in page 34, line 34, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(b) prior to the conclusion of the aforementioned lease, the applicant has served on the qualifying tenant a notice in such form as may be prescribed, informing the qualifying tenant that he (the applicant) wishes to accept the landlord's offer to sell, and that once a contract of sale has been agreed the tenant will no longer have the right to withdraw his consent to the application".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is intended to ensure that the tenant is made fully aware of his right to withdraw consent from an application. We have touched on the subject already, but the tenant's right needs to be reinforced on the face of the Bill. The amendment was drafted by Shelter and deserves positive consideration. As things stand, it is not clear what right the tenant has to withdraw consent for the transfer of his house to another landlord.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part III of the Bill enacts the Government's proposals for so-called tenants' choice. I have already made it clear that I do not like that inappropriate term. It is not the tenant but the acquiring landlord who will exercise the choice. Each clause is drafted in terms of the rights of the applicant landlord who seeks to acquire the tenant's house. Consequently, it is difficult to establish exactly what rights the tenant has during the transfer of his house from one landlord to another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under clause 53 the tenant has the right to withdraw his consent for the initial application. We have already discussed that. The tenant is given a copy of the consent by the potential new landlord. During the later parts of the process of transfer the tenant appears to have no right to be involved or directly consulted at any stage. Following the application, the housing authority has to make an offer to sell to the potential landlord, who then has to serve a notice of acceptance on the housing authority. All that correspondence takes place between the acquiring landlord and the public sector

landlord. The tenant may receive copies of some of it but he is not actively involved at any stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the potential landlord can serve a valid notice of acceptance he and the tenant have to agree a lease. The new landlord and the housing authority then enter into a contract of sale. Between giving his initial consent and signing the lease, the tenant has no right to be part of the process or to have any say in the negotiations. His sole right is to veto the deal by withdrawing his consent or refusing to sign a lease.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The situation is slightly more complicated than that, and the amendment would reinforce the tenant's right to take an active part in the process that will crucially affect the house in which he and his family five. The amendment seeks to establish the stage at which the tenant may withdraw his consent to the transfer, and whether he has the right to refuse to sign a lease.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 53 provides only that the tenant may withdraw his consent to the original application from the acquiring landlord to the public sector landlord. Does that mean that when the housing authority has accepted the notice of application and begins the process of sale the tenant no longer has the right to withdraw his consent? Or is the entire process from the initial serving of the notice of application to the contract of sale deemed to be the application? If so, presumably the tenant would have the right to withdraw his consent to the application even after he had signed the lease, because the application is not concluded until the contract of sale is signed. If that is the case, at what precise time does the tenant cease to be able to withdraw his consent to the application? Can he withdraw that consent at any time until the contract of sale has been concluded? Another possibility is that the tenant can withdraw consent until the applicant has served a notice of acceptance on the housing authority. It would be useful if the Minister could explain exactly how the Government intend the arrangement to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that important fact is not clarified, the tenant's right to refuse to sign a lease may be in jeopardy. If his only opportunity to withdraw consent from the transfer is when the notice of application is served on the housing authority, he would be bound by his initial agreement even if he subsequently had second thoughts. The applicant landlord could thus insist that the tenant sign the lease, however unfavourable to the tenant it might be. The landlord would be entitled to have the lease signed, as would be necessary before he could proceed with the purchase of the tenant's house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Shelter hopes that that would not be the Government's intention. Instead of the disturbing possibilities that I have described, the tenant should have the clear right to withdraw consent until the contract of sale is concluded, or at least until the applicant has served a notice of acceptance on the housing authority. The tenant would then be in a stronger position during negotiations over his future lease. He would be better able to negotiate a fair lease with his future landlord, because if the landlord attempted to force him to agree to an unfavourable lease the tenant would have the ultimate sanction of

	<span class='label label-info column'>1149</span>
withdrawing his consent to the transfer. It is important to establish that right for the tenant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that the tenant should positively agree to the various stages through which the applications pass. I am disturbed because at present the tenant actively intervenes at only two stages—first by signing the consent for the acquiring landlord to approach the public sector landlord, and finally when he signs the lease accepting the new terms of the assured tenancy after the deal has gone through. Otherwise the tenant may from time to time receive copies of legal documents, which he may not understand, but he may not be fully aware of the real implications of being transferred from a secure public sector tenancy at a fair rent into a thoroughly insecure private sector tenancy at a high rent. There must be proper safeguards for tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have already described what could happen, with representatives of an acquiring landlord trying all manner of ploys to persuade the tenant to grant the initial consent. The tenant may think, "Oh, well, it is only an initial consent. There is nothing wrong with allowing them to explore it all, is there?" One can imagine how the prospect could be sold to a tenant. After some months the tenant could find himself at the final stage of the procedure, being offered a new assured tenancy with the acquiring landlord on thoroughly disadvantageous terms. The tenant may be alarmed at the prospect of ending up without a lease—that could happen—and sign the new lease without being aware that even at that late stage he could protect himself and stay safe and sound in a public sector tenancy with all its associated rights. Any tenant would be singularly ill-advised to move from a public sector secure tenancy into a private sector so-called assured tenancy. I hope that voluntary bodies and others who take an interest in tenants' affairs in Scotland will warn them of the dangers to which the Bill will expose them. But there must be proper safeguards, too. I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to confess to having almost fallen asleep over some of the details that we have been considering, but my attention was grabbed by the argument of my hon.

The hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn) and I have already criticised the drafting of the Bill. As a recently practising solicitor my mind is working overtime wondering what would happen if the tenant decided to withdraw his consent under clause 53(4)(b). There is no time limit on that arrangement. Clause 53(4) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"An application shall cease to have effect … if the qualifying tenant withdraws his consent".</p></blockquote>
There is no suggestion of when an application becomes something else. The normal process for selling property in Scotland is that an offer is made and accepted and a contract concluded. I presume that the Government expect there to be such a process, so that the contract would tie both parties, the applicant and the landlord. Superimposed on that situation is the tenant's right. I am intrigued at the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1150</span>
possibility that lax drafting seems to allow—that the contract would be concluded between the landlord and tenant so that each had obligations to the other yet the tenant could still withdraw his consent. Who would be responsible for the breach of contract that would then arise?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Members for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) and for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) for the opportunity to offer reassurance, especially to Shelter, which is behind the amendment, by clearing up any misunderstanding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The application remains an application until missives of sale are concluded. At any time before that the tenant can, by serving notice on the landlord, cause the application to cease to have effect and the transaction to collapse. The transaction cannot in any event proceed unless the tenant reaches agreement with the new landlord on the terms and conditions of the new tenancy. The tenant retains the right to withdraw his consent, so that the application ceases to have effect, until the conditional lease is concluded between the tenant and the applicant, and thereafter until missives of sale have been concluded between the old and the new landlord. I believe that my response will give the Opposition and Shelter the reassurance that they seek. So I hope that the amendment can be withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Act really say, "before missives are concluded"? Statute is being introduced into the common law practices of conveyancing as modified by conveyancies legislation. If the Bill means "if consent is withdrawn before missives have been concluded", why does it not say so? Why should we assume that the Bill means that if it does not say it? It would be a simple clarification. I am all for the shortening of statutes, but to add the words "before missives have been concluded" would not constitute a hefty amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The position is governed by clause 55(2), which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A notice of acceptance under subsection (1) above is of no effect unless the qualifying tenant and the applicant have concluded a lease of the house for a period subsequent to the sale of the house in pursuance of this Part of this Act, being a lease which is conditional upon that sale proceeding."</p></blockquote>
The state of affairs would be reached when missives had been concluded. My hon. and learned Friend has considerable knowledge of conveyancing—although I believe that he once confessed to having failed conveyancing. I find it hard to believe that my hon. and learned Friend has failed any exam, but clearly conveyancing was not his speciality. The position of the tenant is well safeguarded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find it more extraordinary that I ever passed any examinations than that I may have failed one. Sparse and threadbare as my knowledge of conveyancing was when I was examined on it 30 years ago—and it has not improved since—I cannot believe that the exchange of missives is said to conclude a contract. I am sure that the late professor Henry would not have agreed with that. Scotland

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are falling into the trap of talking about the exchange of missives. The offer-to-sell notice is a bureaucratic creation and the notice of acceptance is alien to the normal process of buying and selling property. Both procedures should be regulated. I am worried about laxity. Regardless of
	<span class='label label-info column'>1152</span>
the fact that the landlord and the applicant conclude a bargain, there is still an opportunity for a tenant to say no. I should be interested to know how the Scottish courts would deal with that. The hon. and learned Gentleman's complacency could be misplaced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
