	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had sat down, Mr. Martin.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>174</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may have sat down, but if he thinks that he has heard the last of the debate he is making a serious error of judgment. The Government have abused the House of Commons this afternoon. Just because the Minister is thought of as a rather charming man, he thinks that he can get away with shrugging off a major debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning, my hon. Friends, the Members for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran), for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths), for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion), and for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galloway) raised serious issues concerning a house conditions survey and a housing needs survey. We made serious representations to the Government on behalf of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and Shelter. We cited detailed examples of the inaccuracy of the Government's official statistics on the condition of housing in Scotland, and we outlined the glaring discrepancies between the Government statistics on Glasgow and those of Glasgow district council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully agree with my hon. Friend's comments. Will he give way to the Minister so that the Minister can tell us whether he expects councils to fund the house conditions survey out of the housing revenue account? From which allocation of funds does he expect them to meet such costs?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be delighted to give way to the Minister. This morning he had a sheaf of notes given to him by his advisers to enable him to reply to the debate. Someone has got at him and told him that he had not simply been interrupted by his hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean), who moved the adjournment of the Committee. He has been told that it would be wise for him to kick over the traces and sit down. If the Minister thinks that he can do that, he has another think coming.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is either ignorance or dumb insolence, but it is by no means the end of the debate. We have argued the case for a house condition survey. The Minister referred to section 85 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987, which is a convenient consolidation measure. It provides that local authorities have a statutory duty to analyse the housing need and the condition of housing in the areas for which they are responsible, be they district or islands councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities do not have the wherewithal to carry out that duty as it is extremely complicated to conduct detailed surveys of housing, including not only their own housing stock, but Scottish Special Housing Association, private and owner-occupied housing stock. If local authorites carry out surveys in their own way, a wide range of data will be produced on different bases which will not be comparable, so the statistics will not be so useful as they could and should be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Fairbairn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Perth and Kinross)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman seems to be providing the evidence for the lunacy of his proposition. If local authorities
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0176">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>175</span>
do not carry out surveys properly, what is the sense of putting the matter in a national context? If we accumulate figures about farm cottages in Perthshire and damp in Kinross and Easterhouse and then call them national, the analysis will be infinitely worse. It would be better if those nearer the problem analysed it and informed the Scottish office. We should not try to suggest that there is a Scottish problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is something wonderfully appropriate about getting lectures on lunacy from the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn). However, he has acknowledged my point that it is not satisfactory to have 56 different surveys, perhaps calculated on the basis of different critieria, fed into the Scottish Office to form a basis on which future investment strategy and housing policy can be determined. In case the hon. and learned Gentleman has not noticed, clause 1 provides for the establishment of a new quango called the Scottish Homes, which will have wide-ranging powers under which to determine long-term housing policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most spectacular example that we have illustrated is the difference of opinion about how many houses are below the tolerable standard. The Minister hides behind the Scottish Development Department figures in "Scottish Housing Statistics 1986", which state that there are 55,516 such houses. I wish that the Minister would acknowledge that the database for those statistics is not terribly sound. Will he say why his colleagues in the Department of the Environment and the Welsh Office have set up national house condition surveys in England and Wales to analyse competing claims and target the limited resources? Clearly, the Minister prefers to conceal the circumstances that afflict people on housing estates and in owner-occupied property in Scotland and to rely on patently absurd information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister thinks that 56,516 houses are below the tolerable standard. The detailed analysis carried out in Glasgow shows that that city has 44,000 such houses. The Scottish Development Department therefore made an error of 378 per cent. There are almost four times more houses below the tolerable standard in Glasgow alone than the Scottish Office thought. Yet the Government believe that such figures are good enough.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to be personal, but how many farm cottages in the hon. Gentleman's constituency are below the tolerable standard? Similarly, how many are there on his estate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. and learned Gentleman that there are no houses below the tolerable standard on my farm. I do not know how many such houses there might be in my constituency. The hon. and learned Gentleman tempts me a little because we hear much about substandard public sector housing. He and I were members of the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs, as was the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, when it examined dampness in housing. We saw some appalling
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>176</span>
housing conditions in public sector housing stock. Some of the property was pretty grim, including the damp housing to which my hon. Friend the Member for Hillhead referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The worst housing that I have seen since I became a Member of Parliament, however, was in privately-rented farm cottages in Berwickshire. It is embarrassing to me as a farmer—I refer to myself in my earlier career—that some farmers in Scotland spend a fortune, with the aid of Government grants, to upgrade their farm steadings and housing for their animals, but do not upgrade the houses in which they expect people to live. I do not wish to be unfair to every farmer—many keep their property in good condition—but as a Member originally for the constituencies of Berwickshire and East Lothian—the worst housing stock in which it has ever been my misfortune to set foot was in privately owned and rented former farm cottages. It is a national shame.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) referred earlier to the position in Berwickshire. It would be difficult for a small local authority, such as Berwickshire district council, to carry out a detailed survey and go down every farm track to see how much of the property was in bad condition. Such a local authority will send its returns to the Scottish Development Department every year as required, but the only houses below the tolerable standard that could be taken into account would be those drawn to the attention of the local authorities and they would not get the whole picture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Berwickshire is one of the smallest district councils in Scotland. We discussed Glasgow in detail this morning, which is by far the largest housing authority in Scotland, if not in Britain. We came up with some hair-raising facts and figures about damp housing and about housing with dangerous wiring or without basic amenities, which showed how far adrift the Scottish Office statistics are. We are talking about establishing a great new national housing quango, which is supposed to co-ordinate national housing policy, to assist in backing up local housing authorities and to provide the resources, targeting them in the most appropriate way, to help private landlords and owner-occupiers, housing associations, housing co-operatives and local authorities to deal with the problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part IV of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 requires local authorities to analyse the housing in their areas. The Bill seeks to set up a new creature of statute, a new quango to look after housing in Scotland. Why do not the Government put in the Bill an identical requirement on Scottish Homes, so that it has the information needed to do its job properly?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland seems to have been advised that if he sits down and refuses to take any further part in the debate, we shall make rapid progress. I do not want to fall out personally with the hon. Gentleman as he is a nice guy, but he cannot get away with that sort of conduct. We have seen some despicable conduct from some of the hon. Gentleman's ministerial colleagues in the past 24 hours, and we saw more of it on the Floor of the House today. Housing conditions in Scotland are far
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0177">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>177</span>
too serious a problem for that. The Minister is a constituency Member of Parliament, as are the rest of us, and he meets people in his local surgery who complain about overcrowding, bad housing conditions, long waiting lists and the threat of homelessness. They are not just statistics or faraway theoretical ideas in the minds of Ministers. We are talking about people's personal everyday lives. In Scotland, some people's living conditions are intolerable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are debating legislation to provide a framework for improving the lot of those people in the 1990s and beyond. That is what the Government say that they want to do, but it cannot be done with the information on which the Government are working. If the Government do not know within a factor of 400 per cent. how many houses are below the tolerable standard in Scotland, what is the prospect of Scottish Homes getting its initial decisions even remotely correct? Proper decisions need accurate information. I am not satisfied with the Minister's answer. It will be necessary from now on to put a range of specific points to the Minister. I suspect that several of my hon. Friends will also want to press the Minister for an answer on specific points. I shall try one for starters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 26th January the Minister paid tribute to Shelter in Scotland, referring to the work that had been initiated in care and repair projects. I know something about that because a project has been undertaken in my consitutency. I whole-heartedly welcome the fact that Shelter and the local authority are jointly funding the employment of an official whose job it is to exmine the concentration of owner-occupied housing in bad condition. I met the lady who is doing that job in East Lothian. She started her work in an area of the constituency where many elderly people live in flats, small cottage-type accommodation and owner-occupied houses in the Dunbar area of East Lothian. She has a difficult job. How is she supposed to find out what sort of problems need to be dealt with? How is she supposed to identify concentrations of difficulty? She has been asked by the local authority and Shelter to coordinate efforts to improve owner-occupied housing but what can she do? She can only ask elderly people whether they own their own flats or whether they live in privately rented accommodation and what state it is in. Some elderly people might say, "It is none of your damned business." That lady is supposed to knock on people's doors and ask about the state of the wiring and the roof and whether there is rising damp or condensation. She is supposed to ask, "Would you like me to find you some help?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all want to see such projects succeed—that is why they are supported by Shelter, local authorities and others—but those projects are being initiated on the basis of concentrations of elderly persons in owner-occupied property identified in the 1981 census. How accurate is that census? Is it the best database for setting up projects of that nature? A serious approach is needed to the problems of owner-occupied housing, especially where elderly or
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>178</span>
disabled people have great difficulty understanding the nature of the work that needs to be done. They need to find out where they can get finance, getting a loan from a bank or a local authority grant, which contractors can do the job and how to get competitive quotes for the best possible deal. Many elderly people are worried about the disruption that will be caused to their households by joiners, plumbers and electricians. They will need advice and reassurance about how the work can be done effectively. That is what the care and repair scheme is for. But Shelter has said that it is difficult to embark on such projects in the absence of the sort of data that could be provided by a nationally co-ordinated house condition survey in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a clear need for such a survey, we have demonstrated incontrovertibly that the information available to the Government is little better than fiction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend speaks of the valuable work being done by Shelter, Age Concern and the other organisations involved in the care and repair schemes, but we should not be too fulsome in our praise of the Government. My hon. Friend may not be aware that for at least a year the Minister and his colleagues delayed taking a decision about extending the care and repair project in Edinburgh. At the time, I thought that it was due to the Government's parsimony. My hon. Friend has led me to consider another possibility—that without a house condition survey the Government did not know where to target the money. I believe that there was some correspondence or dialogue with the Minister's predecessor about that matter and about why there were only two such projects at that time, one at Tollcross in Edinburgh and another in the Western Isles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one is more pleased than I am that there has been an extension, but I have a letter from Age Concern Scotland which states that it believes that 50 per cent. of elderly people in inner cities live in substandard housing. I agree with my hon. Friend's comments about the need for a house condition survey to ensure that the small resources that the Government are making available for care and repair are targeted properly, to Edinburgh and the east coast and to the Western Isles—to continue projects already started—and to other areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want anyone to get the impression that we are being critical of the care and repair project, which my hon. Friend supports wholeheartedly. He is right that it must be difficult for the Under-Secretary of State, Shelter or any local authority to identify the areas where it would be most appropriate to set up the schemes. There is some dreadful owner-occupied housing and many elderly people live in difficult circumstances. They need help, support and advice so that they can take advantage of grants and other assistance that can be made available to them. The projects should be targeted on people in the greatest need in areas which face the greatest difficulties. I suspect that someone in the Scottish Development Department has got hold of a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0178">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>179</span>
map and said, "Well, we'll try one here and we'll try one over there because that is a Tory marginal seat and we need to be seen to be doing something".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman aware that care and repair projects receive funding from the Scottish Office but that Shelter decides the projects?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have it in one. I am delighted to hear that we are getting a bit of money. It would be interesting to have a breakdown of who is paying for setting up the projects. Some money comes from the Scottish Office, but how much is funded by Shelter—a charity—and how much comes from the local authorities in the areas involved? How about restoring the proper value of repair and improvement grants for property?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is this the same Shelter organisation that Ministers allege has been exaggerating the problems in Scottish housing and which has a left-wing bias according to some Back Benchers? I am pleased that the Minister has praised and endorsed Shelter's work, but why does he not endorse Shelter's call for a house condition survey?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join people from all parties in Scotland who are worried about housing and the homeless in paying tribute to Shelter, which does a useful job. The Minister says that he has left it to Shelter, a charity, to identify the areas where the care and repair schemes should be set up. The Government want to set up a scheme so that they can say that they are doing something about the problems of elderly owner-occupiers living in bad quality housing, but they have not the remotest idea where to start, so they leave it to Shelter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested to hear that the Minister believes that Shelter should decide the areas in which care and repair schemes should be carried out. As I understand it from the White Paper "Scottish Housing" and from the Bill, local authorities were supposed to take a strategic role in deciding where money should be spent in their areas. The Minister seems to be suggesting that Shelter is usurping the role laid down for district councils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend must not sow seeds of dissent and discord between local authorities and Shelter. I know from personal experience that East Lothian district council was enthusiastic about co-operating with Shelter in setting up a care and repair scheme and I have no doubt that other Labour authorities will be happy to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure my hon. Friend that I am not trying to sow any seeds of division between Shelter and local authorities. I merely point out that the Minister is sowing the seeds of confusion about the Government's intention in introducing the Bill. Who is to take the strategic role on housing in local
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>180</span>
authority areas? Who is to decide how money is best spent—the charities, the local authorities or Scottish Homes? The Minister has not clarified that. I hope that my hon. Friend will press him to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister, poor chap, is obviously confused. Someone has got at him and told him to sit down, shut up and stop demonstrating that he is confused. I see that he is getting a bit more inspiration now, so with a bit of luck he will shortly be reading something out for the record. Now the Whip is starting to bully him. That is appalling. I hope that you will be able to protect the Minister, Mr. Martin. He has much to tell us and he cares about housing. The hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean) is trying to interfere when the Minister is trying to concentrate in important affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like care and repair schemes to be developed in many parts of Scotland. The Minister has confirmed that the Scottish Office does not know where to start. It has had to leave Shelter to consult local authorities and to try to determine the areas in which is would be most appropriate to set up the schemes. Shelter and the East Lothian district council decided that the most fruitful area in which to start the operation would be the Dunbar neighbourhood. I understand that they will also look at the north Berwick area where the Minister lives. The Minister is not elderly enough to qualify for help under a care and repair scheme, but his near neighbour Lord Stodart of Leaston might qualify.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scottish Homes must be taken seriously to be able to determine how to target private or public investment on the improvement, building or management of houses. It must have accurate information, which can be obtained only through a nationally co-ordinated house condition survey such as that which exists in England and Wales. COSLA, the individual members responsible for housing in that organisation, Shelter, and everyone who takes an interest in housing matters is appealing for the establishment of a properly co-ordinated housing conditions survey. Even the Minister, when he replied to my parliamentary question in October, said that he had not closed his mind to the idea and that the Government were considering it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a tailor-made opportunity to lay down a statutory basis for a survey similar to that already mentioned by the Minister in relation to the duty which Government have imposed on local authorities in Scotland. It is right that local authorities should continue to have that duty, although it would be nice if they had the wherewithal properly to carry out that duty. It would be even nicer if the Government were to give an undertaking to provide the funds needed to solve the problems identified by the local surveys. If Scottish Homes, the new co-ordinating body, is to do its job properly, the information must be drawn together so that different neighbourhoods can be compared so as to make it possible to target the available funds as effectively as possible. Surely that is not controversial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am amazed that the Ministr has shrugged off the debate. He will not get away with it—I hope that I have made that clear. I suspect that some of my hon.

Friends will want to return to the debate on this matter. If the Minister fails to respond, we can easily make progress. I should be happy to dispose of this group of amendments and several others. Committees of the House are supposed to be debating Committees when hon. Members can ask questions and Ministers respond.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am surprised that no Conservative Member has seen fit to take part in the debate. I exempt the hon. Members for Penrith and the Border and for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Arbuthnot) from that criticism, as it would obviously be silly for them to support a Scottish housing conditions survey because it would be of no interest to their constituents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend says that he exempts the hon. Member for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Arbuthnot), but when hon. Gentleman's membership of the Committee was challenged at an earlier sitting the Minister defended it by saying that the hon. Gentleman was a chairman of a housing committee and would be able to contribute to our debates and to bring his experience in Kensington and Chelsea to bear on housing conditions in Scotland and the problems that they raise. I therefore looked forward particularly to hearing from the hon. Member for Wanstead and Woodford, but he has yet to raise his head from his correspondence. The Minister owes us an apology for misleading the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely grateful to my hon. Friends the Members for Aberdeen, South and for Dundee, East.

Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire is getting himself into a lather, but that is a fact. We have present an hon. Member who has experience as chairman of a major housing authority in a nation where there is a national housing conditions survey. I am talking about England. The hon. Member for Wanstead and Woodford has experience as chairman of the housing committee of Kensington and Chelsea borough council and presumably had allocations of funds for improvements, for investment in local authority housing, for whatever the English equivalent of the SSHA is, and for his local housing associations. Those funds will have been targeted by the Department of the Environment on the basis of the national house conditions survey in England. One could make a similar point about Cumbria county council and the hon. Member for Penrith and the Border.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are constantly told that it is a unitary Parliament, but when it comes to the treatment of the people and the condition of the houses in which they live, it is not so unitary. The Government are prepared to provide funds for and pay heed to the national housing conditions survey for England and Wales, but they prefer to confuse and conceal the nature and scale of the housing crisis in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have spoken for longer than I intended, so I hope that the Minister has had time to gather his thoughts and to reflect on the serious points raised by my hon. Friends and myself. We trust that he will be prepared to rise to the important responsibilities that he is supposed to carry and which have a direct bearing on the living conditions of every citizen of Scotland. It is not good enough for the Minister to sit in silence and to try to shrug off the case for a housing conditions survey in Scotland. We need a proper reply to the debate, otherwise I suspect that it will go on for some time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) has been extremely polite about the Minister's refusal to respond to the debate. I shall be less polite, for two reasons. First, for the three quarters of an hour before we began this afternoon's sitting I, with other Opposition Members, had to sit and watch the Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth), gloating and chuckling over the little ploy on education which has caused so much anger on Opposition Benches. That is symptomatic of a problem which a former Member of the House, Lord Prior, pointed out before the last election, when he hinted that absolute power corrupts. That corruption

is spreading to the Committee. Secondly, I have not had an answer to the specific questions that I asked the Minister. I intend to repeat those questions to try to coax a reply from him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is not giving the Committee the attention that it deserves. If he would show that he is willing to respond to the debate, and that he has managed to recall the questions asked by my hon. Friend this morning, we would be glad to hear from him.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall repeat the questions that I asked this morning. I shall also return to important issues raised in the debate, although I shall try to avoid repetition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried by one statement that the Minister made this morning. He was at pains to refer to section 85 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987. I am fairly confident that the record will show that the Minister suggested that the Government had, in some way, brought the provision in specifically to deal with the question of the housing conditions survey. The Minister and I well know that that is not true. The Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 is a consolidation Act. The specific provision in section 85 is derived straight from the Housing (Scotland) Act 1974, although I have not gone far enough back to see where that provision came from. The duty placed on local authorities by section 85 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 had been in force at least since 1974. The corresponding provision of the 1974 Act is contained in section 13, which placed a duty on local authorities to secure
	<br><q><p>"that all houses in their district which do not meet the tolerable standard … are closed, demolished or brought up to the tolerable standard within such period as is reasonable in all the circumstances."</p></q>
Today we are not talking about tolerable standards or about the duty which was placed on local authorities by the 1974 Act and its predecessors. That Act was designed specifically to improve the low standards of the housing stock in Scotland, particularly the private housing stock. The Minister should not try to confuse us by saying that it is there to deal with the public sector because it was aimed to deal specifically with the private sector and in particular the problem familiar to some of my hon. Friends of single ends in Glasgow, houses with no inside toilets,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>184</span>
no baths or showers and no proper cooking facilities. Those houses had all the defects specified in section 86 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987, which is derived straight from the Housing (Scotland) Act 1974.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should not seek to suggest that the provisions of section 85 were a Government creation to deal with a house condition survey, because that is not true. The legislation has been in force for 13 years—posibly longer if one checked it carefully—and there has not been a house condition survey in Scotland. We have not had one because that provision is meant to deal with a particular problem. As a solicitor in private practice I have had experience of the improvement orders imposed by local authorities and the steps which local authorities can take under the Act. The Act does not deal with the specific problem that the Opposition have described which is the condition of local authority houses. Following the logic of the Bill, if Aberdeen district council discovers that it owns a defective property it has to serve a notice on itself and impose upon itself the obligation to bring that house up to standard, but the Act just does not work like that. Tenants in Scotland have been forced to use other legislation such as public health legislation. The Act deals with the private sector. I accept that it could be extended to the public sector, but that was not what it was intended to do or how it operates at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I raised a specific point this morning. I understand from what the Minister said that local authorities under the powers available to them under section 85 would have the authority to deal with the problem of defects in any property owned by Scottish Homes. I accept that that would be feasible under the Bill. But again, that is not what we are talking about. We are talking about having a proper assessment. My main concern is who pays. I understand from the Minister that the local authority is to pay. What part of the housing budget will cover the costs of that programme? What additional finance will the Minister provide to ensure that that survey is carried out? Why cannot it be clearly spelt out where the money will come from?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I return to the point raised by the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn). I do not think that he was totally aware of what he was saying, but he was arguing our point for us. He was arguing the case for a national house condition survey. He made the point that it is no good just bringing together a hotchpotch of local authority representations or figures—it has to be coordinated. A national housing body—Scottish Homes—is to be created. There is no reason why the Scottish district councils—the housing authorities—should have a duty imposed on them to carry out a house condition survey in their own areas when the national housing body does not have a corresponding duty. We want to take it a stage further and ensure that the local authorities and Scottish Homes coordinate their activities. There is nothing illogical in that. It is perfectly reasonable, particularly as the powers exist in England and Wales. I see no reason why that should not be extended to Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to respond to the many points which have been raised in the debate. The hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) asked about Shelter's work. Funding for Shelter's work, both for the rural housing project and for care and repair has been provided by the Scottish Development Department. Age Concern also receives funding and was at one time wholly funded by the Scottish Development Department. We continue to award a substantial proportion of Age Concern's Scottish funding. Shelter makes proposals about the care and repair programme. However, I did not say that it should be left to Shelter, nor am I asking Shelter to take on a strategic role. Shelter sought funding on the basis of specific proposals and we responded. We will be pleased if local authorities carry out the proper local surveys to assist this process. When Shelter received funding from the Department for care and repair it made no mention of difficulty in selecting the areas concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for East Lothian also mentioned the discrepancy in figures this morning. I shall clarify my remarks about the number of houses which are below tolerable standards. On 31 December 1977 there were 150,000. On 31 March 1979 that figure had fallen to 121,000. No figure was published for 1978. In November 1987 the figure was 57,000 and it has fallen by 2,000 over the past two months to 55,000. That illustrates my point that the figures are not static. Since 1979, the figure of 121,000 houses below tolerable standard has been reduced by 66,000 to 55,000. In other words, it has been reduced by just over a half.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that when 	<i>Hansard</i> is printed it will show that this morning, the Minister said there were 152,000 houses in 1979. What has heppened to the other 31,000 houses in the meantime?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be glad to clarify that. The hon. Member for East Lothian pointed out a discrepancy in the parliamentary answer which gave a figure of 121,000 in 1979. I have checked on that. The error was in the date. I make it quite clear that the figure of 150,000 was for 31 December 1977 and on 31 March 1979itwas 121,000. As I have said, it fell to 57,000 in November 1987 and it is now 55,000.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister seriously believe that there are only 57,000 houses below the tolerable standard in Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is anticipating what I am about to say. This morning he said that there were 44,500 houses below tolerable standard in Glasgow. I should like to give the Committee the figures available to the Department from returns made by Glasgow district council. The figure for March 1986 was 11,452. In Glasgow the figure has continued to show a steady decline. The figure which the council submitted for March 1987 was 9,446. I await Glasgow district
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>186</span>
council's figures for March 1988 with interest. The Scottish Development Department will obviously discuss the basis of any significant change with the district council. If it submits different figures, we shall obviously wish to discuss them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has had fair warning that it is on the cards that the district council will be submitting substantially different figures from those submitted last time. Is there not a case for making a distinction between the information derived from very patchy sources in the past with a proper information based on a comprehensive survey? The previous figures from Glasgow were hopelessly inaccurate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the hon. Gentleman that section 1 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 states that:
	<br><q><p>"Every local authority shall consider the housing conditions in their areas and the need of the area for further housing accommodation."</p></q>
Section 85(1) states that:
	<br><q><p>"It shall be the duty of every local authority to secure that all houses in their district which do not meet the tolerable standard are closed, demolished or brought up to the tolerable standard within such period as is reasonable in all the circumstances."</p></q>
That is undoubtedly a duty that all councils have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We began this sitting at 4.57 p.m. it is now 5.50 p.m. The Minister had a brief at the start of our sitting, yet we have wasted an hour asking him to respond to the points made this morning. That hour has been wasted due to the Minister's unwillingness to answer the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) and myself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The regular procedure in a Standing Committee is for hon. Members to raise any points on behalf of their constituents. I think that all hon. Gentlemen, with the possible exception of the hon. Member for East Kilbride (Mr. Ingram), spoke this morning. I responded to those points and, naturally, I expected hon. Gentlemen to make further points if they were not satisfied. They have done so, and I am going through those further points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) asked why local authorities should help Scottish Homes. Local surveys would not be for Scottish Homes, but to fulfil the local authority's statutory duties for all housing in its area. The hon. Member for Dundee, East asked about houses without hot water. That is covered by section 86(1)(e) of the 1987 Act which defines a house with tolerable standards as having:
	<br><q><p>"a sink provided with a satisfactory supply of both hot and cold water within the house".</p></q>
A well-managed local authority should know which houses in its own stock are in poor condition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Special Housing Association is well known for its internal monitoring system which keeps it aware of the condition of its stock. Local authorities can apply similar methods to establish which houses in its stock are in poor condition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>187</span>
I was asked about the funding of local district council surveys. An authority can charge the cost of a local survey to the general rate if it is not in receipt of housing support grant. However, it qualifies for rate support grant. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths) was interested in that. It qualifies for rate support grant, because a survey is not exclusively for the benefit of the authority's own tenants, but for the benefit of those who live in housing generally. It is up the local authority to carry out local surveys, and we strongly encourage it do to so, so that it can carry out the duty imposed on it by section 85.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for East Lothian also referred to the danger of local authorities carrying out surveys on different bases. It is for that reason that the Scottish Office has issued 80 pages of guidance to local authorities to assist them. He also asked about an English survey. The Scottish Office has closer links with local authorities than is possible in England. The English survey does not produce details at a level which give a proportionate sample and that would not be of any great value at the district level in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for East Lothian also asked about a census. The census involves a 100 per cent. survey. The national house conditions survey in England uses a sample which is a mere fraction of 1 per cent. I do not think that there is much doubt as to which is the more reliable source. I hope that the hon. Member for East Lothian will recall his opening comments in his reference to overlapping responsibilities. He used the words "reluctant to do that sort of thing".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no disagreement that the assessment of need is extremely important, but it cannot be right to give Scottish Homes statutory duties which overlay the existing statutory duty of local authorities. The White Paper makes it clear that we wish to see local authorities develop their important strategic role. I am sure that Scottish Homes will help, particularly the small authorities, to achieve that. However, that is different from the proposals in the amendments. I recommend that the amendments be withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has helped to some extent by taking part in the debate. By doing that, he has shown a marked contrast between himself and other Conservative Members who, by their silence, have shown their utter contempt for the subject. They sit in serried rows, silent as Trappist monks. They are probably frightened of the hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean) who will report them to the lady queen. Even the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbarn) and the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) have been silenced by threats. It is a disgrace. I have listened to the speeches about berries and so on, and if the hon. Member for Tayside, North did not speak again, the Committee would benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister did break his silence, he did not answer the question regarding the different information that we were given about the number of houses in Scotland that were below the tolerable standard.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>188</span>
The Minister has revised what he said this morning. He said that on 31 December 1977, 150,000 houses were below the tolerable standard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, the Secretary of State for Scotland said that 10 years ago, 120,000 houses in Scotland were below tolerable standards. As the Second Reading was on 11 January 1988, I assume that the Secretary of State was referring to 11 January 1978–11 days after 31 December 1977. The Minister is asking the Committee to accept that during the first 11 days after 31 December 1977. The Minister is asking the Committee to accept that during the first eleven days of January 1978, 30,000 houses were raised above the tolerable standard in Scotland. That was the period when Scotland was enjoying the new year festivities and people were on holiday, getting drunk and staying away from work. I only speak from personal experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During that period 30,000 houses were mysteriously raised above the tolerable standard. That is not credible. He knows that and he owes the Committee an explanation for the difference in information given by the Secretary of State for Scotland and himself. Their failure to get to grips with the figures underlines more than anything else the need for a proper national housing conditions survey in Scotland so that we may know the facts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government can get those figures so wrong, perhaps they are getting other figures wrong. In a previous sitting, we were discussing whether there was any genuine homelessness in Scotland and the Minister said
	<br><q><p>"At present in Scotland there are about 130,000 more houses than households".—[	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 21 January 1988; col. 30.]</p></q>
He implied that if people were genuinely homeless they would have taken some of those empty houses, but if he can get figures about sub-tolerable standards of housing so badly wrong, who is to say that he did not get those figures wrong? Is he sure that there are 130,000 more empty houses in Scotland than hornless people? In view of the discrepancy in figures that have been quoted to us, we can no longer believe other figures that we are given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not merely a matter of statistics, as what is called into question is whether hon. Members can believe the Secretary of State for Scotland. On Second Reading, the right hon. and learned Gentleman said,
	<br><q><p>"Ten years ago, 120,000 houses in Scotland were deemed to be below the tolerable standard—that is, without some of the basic amenities that we ought to be able to take for granted. Today that figure is down to 55,000"—</p></q>
At least the Secretary of State and the Minister agree on that—
	<br><q><p>"and in a few years, on the present course, we shall be able to eliminate such houses."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 11th January 1988; vol. 125, c. 41.]</p></q>
That is what the Secretary of State for Scotland said, but can we believe his figures? That is an important question, because if Scottish Homes is to come into being in a context in which the Secretary of State for Scotland and perhaps the Minister with
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0183">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>189</span>
responsibility for housing are saying that there are no houses in Scotland below the tolerable standard, Scottish Homes may not pay attention to the need for a survey on housing conditions to establish how many houses in Scotland are below the tolerable standard and about which it could do something.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Secretary of State and the Minister have got the figures wrong, that may not be due to a genuine mistake but a fiddling of the figures to make it appear as though there are no houses in Scotland below a tolerable standard. Perhaps the Government wish to remove from Scottish Homes any responsibility for dealing with a serious problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that there was a statutory duty on local authorities to improve houses under their control to above the tolerable standard within a reasonable period. He has admitted that 55,000 houses are below the tolerable standard and I ask him to tell the Commitee whether any of them are under local authority control and, if any are, for how long they have remained below that standard. What does the Minister mean by "a reasonable period"? Why has nothing been done about such houses? Were those 55,000 houses included in the figures of 120,000 or 150,000 sub-tolerable houses that existed in 1978 and have they been below that standard for the past 10 years?

It may be that not only local authority houses are involved and that significant numbers are in the private sector. If houses in the private sector were below the tolerable standard in 1978 they may be below that standard now. Is there no statutory duty on the private sector to improve such houses to above the tolerable standard? Perhaps the Government are so complacent in that regard that they are prepared to sit on their backsides and do nothing. The Minister must explain the Government's attitude to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) disputed whether there were 10,000 or 45,000 houses in Glasgow below the tolerable standard. I understand that the difference probably stems from the different interpretation that has been put on the definition of the low—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Munro) has woken up. He should go back to sleep as we are dealing with the affairs of the Scottish people and that matter has nothing to do with the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In regard to the definition of "below the tolerable standard", Glasgow district council probably applies a more severe standard than the Government when it says that 44,500 houses in its area are below the tolerable standard. The Minister stated that section 86(1)(e) of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 insisted that houses above the tolerable standard had to have both hot and cold water supplies. Does he agree that it would be better if the definition of tolerable standard also specified that houses should be free from condensation? I asked the Minister a question on that subject this morning but he has not answered it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is not primariily a debate about the definition of tolerable
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>190</span>
standards, but a definition is given in section 86(1)(b) of the 1987 Act. which states:
	<br><q><p>"is substantially free from rising or penetrating damp".</p></q>
A number of different conditions of the definition are given in section 86(1).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the answer that I tried to get from the Minister. I explained that we know about damp but the principal argument that atrises between public and private sector tenants and their landlords concerns the definition of "damp". Technically, "damp" can only be regarded as rising damp and when tanants make complaints about damp, landlords will say, "Unless it is rising damp that comes upwards from the foundations, we do not consider it to be damp.". However, condensation can be as debilitating to tenants as rising damp and that is a serious problem that affects many people in Scotland. It is unacceptable that the definition of tolerable standard excludes condensation. The Minister must tell the Committee whether the Government are prepared to include it with damp in the definition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Condensation and rising damp are not the only problems. The Minister mentioned hot and cold water for wash basins, but COSLA recommends that each house should have a bath or a shower in addition. Surely, in Scotland in 1988, it is not too much to ask that people should have facilities in their houses to permit them to take showers or baths. That is not asking for luxury. I am sure that the hon. and learned Minister for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn) will have a bath or shower somewhere in his k3th century castle. Perhaps he takes his baths in the moat, although that is hard to accept from looking at his appearance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must answer that question and he must also deal with standards of renovation. I ask him to tell the Committee the Government's view on whether the tolerable standard should be improved in the ways that I have suggested and whether the standard of renovation that COSLA recommends should be accepted. It is vital that the Minister gives his view on whether there should be insulation standards so that something may be done to help the old people who die each year from hypothermia in Scotland. I keep forgetting that I am in England as my mind and my heart are in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a document which I believe the Minister will have received, Age Concern states:
	<br><q><p>"In the last 12 years, over 3,000 old people were diagnosed as having died from hypothermia in Scotland. That is just the tip of the iceberg, because many doctors are unwilling to put it on the death certificate and because many older people die of cold-related illness rather than hypothermia 	<i>per se.</i> Age Concern Scotland has commissioned new research and found that hospital admissions rise during cold spells. This new research shows that within a week of a cold spell falling below 0°C there are more admissions to hospital for cold-related diseases … For instance within a week of a cold spell with average temperatures falling below 0°C in Glasgow, acute respiratory hospital admissions go up by 105 per cent., bronchitis by 58 per cent. In Glasgow, pneumonia and influenza admissions rise dramatically … The fact that hospital admissions rise shows that old people's houses are not independent of the climate. We know old people go out less in winter, in fact in cold weather they are advised by the media not to go out."</p></q>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0184">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>191</span>
—I understand that the Government give assistance to the media to tell old people to stay at home in winter—
	<br><q><p>"It is the house which is the determining factor in their admission to hospital."</p></q>
Almost all of the controversy that has consumed the House of Commons in this Session has been about expenditure on the National Health Service, but the Minister's inaction has directly contributed to the burden on the NHS because he is not prepared to do anything about tackling the real problem of improving insulation standards for homes in Scotland. That is a direct contributory cause of old people being admitted to hospital and imposing a burden on the NHS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister cannot have it both ways. He cannot say that the matter has nothing to do with him or lower his eyes and refuse to answer questions. He must give the Government's view on what tolerable standards should be. Should they be as set out in the 1986 Act, or as COSLA advises in its Scottish housing manifesto? What does the Minister have to say about renovation standards and, most importantly, about insulation standards? The Government cannot wash their hands of old people's deaths, yet that is what Conservative Members seem to be doing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's intervention was helpful. It was charming to hear him today, of all days, speak about the importance of preserving local authorities' rights in this matter. He says that he is not prepared to do something that local authorities thoughout Scotland are appealing for him to do, for the good of their own areas and the nation, because he does not wish to interfere with their rights. At the same time, his colleagues are cheerfully trampling over local authorities' rights on education. The Government are hypocritical to wade through local democracy in Scotland if they believe that they will gain short-term popularity in one neighbourhood, when in this matter, because they may be embarrassed and although it would be to the advantage of Scottish people and local authorities, they do not want to know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a case for setting up Scottish Homes, the new national housing agency, although Opposition Members do not like some aspects of it. One of its prime functions should be to co-ordinate and to help to found a national house condition and house need survey. COSLA wants the agency to have that coordinating function, yet the Minister, amazingly, refuses to set up a framework to require that to happen. He seems to be satisfied with the duff statistics that he has received and is trying to pass responsibility for them to local authorities. Local authorities have had a hard time under the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: the Minister gave the figures for Glasgow and there is a logical explanation for them. The local authority is looking at the state of its housing stock and applying broader criteria to the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>192</span>
definition of below tolerable standard. Those criteria are more in keeping with the 1980s than when the term was first introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Have the Government challenged the figures for Nairn or Berwickshire? I understand from the returns to the Scottish Development Department, which the Minister will have scrutinised, that neither of those authorities requires any houses to be modernised or repaired and that no houses in their areas suffer from dampness or condensation. Does the Minister accept those figures or, as with Glasgow, has he sought further explanation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman intervened in the speech of the Opposition spokesman and so it is not in order for him to address his comments to the Minister. If the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's reference to Berwickshire fills me with alarm. My hon. Friend, if I may so describe him, the Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) will be as astonished as I to hear that no house in Berwickshire is below the tolerable standard. I assure my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths) that that is not so. If the Scottish Office is labouring under the illusion that no houses in Berwickshire are below a tolerable standard, it is in cloud cuckoo land. That is a problem and I wish the Minister would acknowledge it. He may then begin to do something about it.

I return to the Glasgow figures. The Minister quoted official statistics that were given to him by Glasgow district council on the basis of the limited information that was available to the council. The published figures state that 11,452 houses in the Glasgow city council area are below tolerable standard. A more detailed survey was carried out in Glasgow. The report is not secret and the Minister should have a copy of it because I am sure that the council circulated it to the Scottish Development Department. Following a detailed analysis of the position in Glasgow, during which a large sample was studied scientifically, it was found that 44,500 houses are below the tolerable standard. Will the Minister tell the Committee how many houses in Glasgow are below the tolerable standard?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Glasgow district council has not formally submitted figures in its returns. That procedure is required of every authority throughout Scotland. When those returns are submitted, there will be an opportunity for discussion.The figure of 11,452 referred to March 1986. It was lower in March 1987 at 9,446. If there is a huge increase we shall examine the figures carefully and discuss them with the council, as we shall with any local authority whose figures increase greatly. I stress that the official returns have not been submitted by Glasgow city council and we await those in March.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

What could be more fundamental than the number of houses that are below the tolerable standard? The Minister quoted figures submitted to him by Glasgow district council on the basis of results in the past. Everyone knows that those figures were a stab in the dark. They were gathered from very limited research material. We have now discovered that the position is more serious. Will the Minister acknowledge that he and his Department do not have a clue about how many houses in Scotland are below the tolerable standard? I know that he has received statistics and figures from district councils. Will he tell the Committee how many houses, to within 10,000 in Scotland today are below the tolerable standard?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman had listened, he would have heard me say several times that the most recent figure is 55,000 houses. This is not primarily a debate about what is below tolerable standards. If the hon. Gentleman is not satisfied with the criteria laid down in clause 86 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 he is free to table a new clause to allow a different interpretation of "below tolerable standards". That is the way to proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The information given by the Scottish Office on houses below the tolerable standard must be the most critical figure. A house condition survey should cover a multitude of important considerations, but the most critical figure must be the number of houses below the tolerable standard.

The Minister is sticking to his guns—he thinks that his statistics make sense, although it is palpably obvious that they do not. The situation is infinitely worse than his figures suggest. The only conclusion that we can draw is that the Government are happy to conceal the housing crisis in Scotland. They prefer not to know about the conditions in which our people live.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am genuinely disappoined that the Minister has taken this line. He hides behind figures that everyone knows are inaccurate and misleading and will presumably continue to take decisions based on inaccurate and misleading information. His figures for the number of empty houses and homeless people in Scotland are probably wrong as well, covering only those who have applied under the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act 1979. There are many more people than that who are homeless or on the margins of homelessness. The situation is appalling. I am appalled that the Scottish Office does not want to know. We suggest that Scottish Homes be used to collect and collate accurate information so that investment can be targeted. Unlike its English and Welsh counterparts, the Scottish Office prefers to act on bad information. That is a deplorable state of affairs.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The returns sent to the Scottish Office do not distinguish between the private and the public sectors.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister helps our argument considerably, but we need more than an estimate. We need to know to which sector those houses belong. I find it difficult to believe that a local authority would send in a return stating that even one of its houses was below the tolerable standard. Apart from those acquired under compulsory purchase orders for specific schemes, the bulk of the houses owned by local authorities were built this century.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian has said that local authorities are crying out for a national housing needs survey. They could co-ordinate it through COSLA. Can the Minister explain why local authorities, which are making that plea either through COSLA or directly, think that they do not have the powers? The Minister tells us that they have the powers, but they assume that they do not. If all the district housing authorities in Scotland have had the power—nay, the duty—to carry out a housing needs survey for at least 13 years, why have only two authorities in Scotland done so? What encouragement will the Minister give to local authorities, especially Aberdeen district council, to carry out such surveys? Aberdeen district council will have its housing budget cut next year by a grant total of £1·25 million. That does not strike me as much of an encouragement to that authority to carry out a housing conditions survey.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Allocations to authorities are based on assessed needs. The hon. Gentleman came to see me a few days ago and I made a supplementary allocation to Aberdeen—of £400,000—and to other local authorities in Scotland. We consider carefully the assessed needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said this morning, the Government are preparing, with COSLA, a local house condition survey kit which will be available this year to give practical help to local authorities in carrying out the necessary surveys. We hope that that will be of considerable assistance. We are not convinced that a survey would yield results at below district level unless the sample size was large. The cost of a survey is about £5 million, so we should not launch into it automatically as there are many other pressing priorities in Scotland. It is the statutory duty of local authorities to carry out such surveys. We hope that they will respond to that duty with the help of the local house condition survey kit from the Scottish Office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In addition to the kit, how much money will be made available in the rate support grant settlement? Will the £5 million, or a proportion thereof, be made available to local authorities? Otherwise, how can the Minister expect councils to carry out those surveys when currently they have to choose between spending money on eradicating dampness, on modernisation, on rewiring or on other problems? The surveys are needed to ensure that local authority and Government resources are not wasted in the long term and that local authorities make sensible spending plans. Local authorities have been no more guilty than Governments of channelling resources into faulty housing. It is important for extra money to be made
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>196</span>
available to local authorities in the rate support grant settlement, which has been declining in recent years. Does the Minister expect them to use his wonderful kit without extra resources?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The rate support grant settlement is based on local authorities' total budgets, not on specific items. I have already answered the question about authorities not in receipt of housing support grant.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I trust that the Minister will be winding up at the end of the debate because he has not answered any of my questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will not say whether he accepts that housing below a tolerable standard exists, or whether the stock should be improved in line with COSLA's recommendations.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hate to disillusion my hon. Friend, but the debate has proved that the Under-Secretary of State can remain silent—whether from ignorance or insolence, I do not know. In effect, the Minister has acknowledged that the figures on which the Scottish Office are working are little better than fairy tales, but the Government are refusing point blank to ensure that future housing policy in Scotland is based on more accurate information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In response to my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran), the Minister said that district councils had a statutory duty to survey the housing conditions in their areas and to submit the figures to the Scottish Development Department, which would then keep a record. As my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian said, Glasgow's house conditions survey of 1987 showed that the current method employed by the SDD in obtaining such figures is pathetic. Its statistics on Glasgow were out by 400 per cent. It seems from the Minister's argument that he is content for that to be the position. He seems to be saying that everything in the garden is rosy and that we should continue acting in the way in which we have been for the past 30 years. The figures show that the Government are getting it wildly wrong. Is the Minister really that complaceent? Is he saying that as the Government have got everything else wrong for the past nine years they may as well get this legislation wrong, too?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>197</span>
the past decade. Perhaps then we would start to see the truth that, far from the standards rising, they are declining sharply. The Minister conceded that the cost of a national house conditions survey would be £5 million. The Government are not prepared to establish such a survey because it will cost a great deal of money and will highlight the state of Scotland's housing stock, which the Government wish to hide from the people of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the strategic role in housing will be a matter for the district councils, but the role of Scottish Homes will be entirely outside that strategic role. Scottish Homes will have the role of a buccaneer roaming throughout Scotland spending money as and were it wishes. The Minister does not seem to take that into account. Scottish Homes should spend its budget in local authority areas in accordance with the councils' priorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will continue to underfund local authorities so that they cannot find out the proper condition of their housing stock. He prefers to have 56 different councils using uncertain methods to find out what they think is the state of their housing. As long as district councils are in the dark and do not know what is needed to be done in their areas, Scottish Homes will have a free hand to spend money on such projects as the Merchant City of Glasgow, instead of projects that will raise people's living standards. The Minister will not consider that problem. It is frustrating for new members of the Committee to see a Minister think that he can get away with simply refusing to answer questions. It is a disgrace.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I kept my four questions to the Minister brief and to the point because enough time has been wasted in the Committee already, especially by him. I have received no satisfactory answers. Will he say why local authorities are pressing for the right to undertake a house conditions survey in their areas when, as he says, they already have that power? Why were they not previously aware of it? Section 85(1) of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 states:
	<br><q><p>"It shall be the duty".</p></q>
Will the Minister tell us why local authorities have not so far carried out house conditions surveys? If such a power exists, clearly they have been breaking the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to a survey kit, which is fine as far as it goes. We welcome the news that a standard is to be drawn up. However, rather than worrying about the right procedure whereby local authorities select the houses, we are concerned about the money being given to them to enable them to carry out the survey. What assurances and encouragements can the Minister give to local authorities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister wish to reply?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have very little to add to what I have said. It is ironic that the hon. Gentleman should be arguing in favour of the Government trying to exercise compulsion on local authorities to carry out surveys. Compulsion is not part of my philosophy with regard to the Bill. Local
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>198</span>
authorities will respond to the guidance of the Scottish Office. The local house conditions survey kit will be invaluable to them and many more local surveys will be carried out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is still the second point on encouragement. I raised the issue of local authorities breaking the law because section 85 has simply been conjured up by the Minister's advisers to deal with the Opposition's arguments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's position goes from the supine to the ridiculous. To say that local authorities might be forced to take part in a housing conditions survey is ludicrous coming from anyone who purports to know anything about the Scottish scene. Local authorities are begging the Government to do what they saw fit to do in England and Wales and to carry out a house conditions survey. The Government did not have to twist any arms—they were responding, again, to the legitimate demands of local authorities and their ratepayers to give some support in the form of more than a kit. The Government provided a kit for England and Wales, but the also provided the resources to go with it. We are not discussing whether the authorities want such a kit because we know that they do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever the Minister says, and however available he makes kits and information, it is clear that the Government do not want to know the results. From the way in which Glasgow and a number of other local authorities have tackled the problem, we know that when resources are channelled into the area because of the need to plan for the future, the position is far worse than the Minister, the Government or official statistics have shown.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of contrasting the house conditions survey with the returns to the Scottish Development Department, anyone with experience of housing in Scotland has known for a number of years that those returns have not been treated as a statutory requirement for a bid for resources and an analysis of the problems. The returns are matched up to the money which councils think that the Government will make available, following previous patterns. That has been made clear time and again to the Minister and his predecessors by the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and by individual councils. They knew roughly what the Government would make available, and it was usually a reducing sum, so their returns to the SDD reflected that reducing sum. It is only over the past few years, as the pressure has increased and the Government have starved councils of money for housing, that local authorities have submitted what they see as a realistic appraisal of their housing needs. In the 1960s and 1970s there was no requirement for two different sets of figures as councils tried to tackle the needs of their areas. I am pleased that at the beginning of his remarks, the Minister paid tribute—as did the Secretary of State and the White Paper—to the fact that housing conditions have improved over the last century. That is because, unlike this Government, previous Governments were willing to work in

partnership with local authorities. It is the Minister who talked about compulsion in terms of the housing conditions survey, not COSLA or the Opposition.

I hope that I speak for all Opposition Members when I say that we have heard no convincing argument for not accepting the amendment. It is ironic as well as sad that we are having this debate at all. The argument was conceded long ago in England and Wales by a Government of the same complexion as the Minister, but we have had to raise the matter here because the Government wish to remain ignorant of the figures in Scotland. That reinforces my earlier comment that the Government have produced one of the most callous and ignorant Front Bench teams that Scotland has ever seen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We had a detailed and useful discussion of the preceding group of amendments. This group, especially amendment No. 103, is also very important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 103 seeks to replace subsection 3(g) with the provision that Scottish Homes shall have the general functions of
	<br><q><p>"Promoting and developing the provision of community care throughout Scotland in conjunction with the relevant bodies".</p></q>
The aim of the amendment is to ensure that Scottish Homes becomes an active participant in the joint planning process with health boards, local authorities and the various voluntary organisations involved in community care. More importantly, the amendment would also allow Scottish Homes to provide much-needed physical and financial help to meet the needs identified through the provision of housing and services as required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Credit should go to the existing organisations and individuals for their highly imaginative efforts in the provision of community care against a difficult financial background that is not of their making. The Government have not been helpful, which creates difficulties for all the agencies involved. Although much is being done—with little or no Government aid—clearly more needs to be done. If Scottish Homes is to have any useful purpose as a national housing agency—it will look after about 83,000 houses at the start—it should be given the capacity to harness many of the successful and innovative ideas in community care, and to facilitate their implementation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0189">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>201</span>
Paragraph (h) of the amendment would allow Scottish Homes to assist local authorities to meet their statutory responsibilities for homeless people under Part II of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987. One of the principle reservations and criticisms of individuals and organisations involved in housing about the Scottish Homes proposal is that no specific mention is made about the agency's responsibility to house homeless people or provide permanent accommodation for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have already referred to the growing homelessness crisis in Scotland and shall return to that matter as we come to specific amendments. But again, it is worth putting the homelessness position on the record. There are about 200,000 people on local housing waiting lists and about 31,000 known homeless persons. The problem has reached an astounding magnitude. No matter how the Government try to disguise the matter, the thousands of homeless persons—families, children and elderly people—know that the Government and the Scottish Office are to blame for their plight. It is not the fault of local authorities or the SSHA—the responsibility rests firmly and squarely with the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the new town of East Kilbridge, which I represent, the growing homelessness problem has reached unacceptable levels. For many years the Government refused the development corporation the right to build houses for rent. Recently they lifted the moratorium, but more than 3,000 people are already on the homeless list. They include single pensioners, many of whom are in their late seventies—indeed, I have dealt with cases of single pensioners in their eighties who have been declared homeless—young married couples, young single people and, of course, one-parent families. All those people have to wait an unacceptably long period for a home in a new town in Scotland. The problem was largely created by the Government's moratorium on house building. When the development corporation was generating millions of pounds of profit, the Government refused to let that housing agency, under their direct control, put the money back into house building. If the Government did that with a new town development corporation, what will they do with Scottish Homes? The Government's track record in dealing with homelessness is abysmal. It is little wonder that organisations such as Shelter, the Scottish Council for the Single Homeless, local authorities throughout Scotland and other caring organisations are worried because the Bill is silent about homelessness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scottish Homes' responsibility to assist local authorities to meet their statutory duty to homeless people under part II of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 must be clearly spelt out in the Bill. That is the purpose of paragraph (h) of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph (i) of the amendment states:
	<br><q><p>"Exercising regular supervision and control of any body or person funded under Section 2(2) of this Act or approved under Part III of this Act;".</p></q>
It seeks to allay the worry that has been expressed that the only supervisory role of Scottish Homes will be for registered housing associations. It will be given no more powers than those that the Housing
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>202</span>
Corporation currently has. Paragraph (i) seeks to extend the powers to include on-going supervision of any organisation or person grant aided by Scottish Homes, as well as landlords approved for the purposes of tenants' choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By their omissions in the Bill, the Government have cast away their so-called anxiety about value for money and their past enthusiasm for tenants' rights. Tenants who choose to move and have other landlords will lose their security and right to buy, as well as any effective means of ensuring that management and physical standards are maintained. Paragraph (i) recognises that the monitoring arrangements used for the Housing Corporation are generally satisfactory and should be extended to cover other agencies benefiting from direct or indirect funding through Scottish Homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 119 deals with the same concept as paragraph (g) of amendment No. 103, so my earlier comments stand. Local authorities have expressed genuine anxiety on this matter, so I hope that the Minister will deal with it.

I wish to concentrate on the amendments tabled in my name rather than those in the name of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths). They
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0190">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>203</span>
were suggested to me by the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations and relate to two specific and important matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
8.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 100 states:
	<br><q><p>'(h) providing, assisting or co-ordinating nationally the provision of funding to housing associations intending to provide and/or manage supported accommodation projects.'.</p></q>
I am sure that members of the Committee are aware that supported accommodation is an increasingly important part of the work of housing associations. The purpose of the amendment is to enable housing associations that intend to set up supported accommodation projects to obtain finance from one main source. That is the crux of the amendment. A large amount of housing association work is already involved in provision of that type of accommodation, and if the trend continues they will be providing even more. Supported accommodation can take a variety of forms. It can provide homes for people suffering from mental illness or handicap and physical handicap or disability. The accommodation is intended to try to keep the physical surroundings such that residents can remain in the community and play a part in it. That is the main purpose of the supported accommodation provided by housing associations. The financing of such projects is not straightforward. It is fraught with difficulties because, while it is legally possible for social work departments and health boards to co-operate in joint funding projects, it is complicated to co-ordinate the schemes in practice. A later amendment relates to joint financing of projects, and the idea may have been a justification for that amendment. Scottish Homes should be empowered to co-ordinate the provision of funding, negotiating and reaching agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are all aware that by the time that complicated negotiations are completed and financial packages put together, the seller of the proposed site for the project has often changed his mind, obtained a better offer or, in extreme cases, have died of old age. It is not easy to put such projects together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the amendment were accepted, it would help to ensure care in the community—something that the Government profess to be their policy. Indeed the Government's consultation paper states in paragraph 2.9 that Scottish Homes
	<br><q><p>"should embrace the promotion of better links between housing and other aspects of public sector provision for the community, such as health and social work."</p></q>
If that is to have any meaning and relevance to the work carried out by housing associations, amendment No. 100 should be accepted. It would clarify the matter and make that potential a reality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The idea embodied in amendment No. 101 was suggested by the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations, and deals with eligibility for DHSS allowances. As a former social security spokesperson for my party—whatever it used to be or now is—I became interested in the complex technical registration and qualification provisions of support
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>204</span>
for residents from the DHSS board-and-lodging payments regime. This is one small aspect of a complicated issue, but it is important and relevant to the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to add another paragraph to clause 1(3), so that Scottish Homes would
	<br><q><p>"(j) assume responsibility for all aspects of registration of housing association accommodation which would normally qualify for registration under section 61 of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968."</p></q>
The purpose of the amendment is to enable housing associations, that offer to provide accommodation for persons in need of support to be eligible for DHSS allowances. The Minister knows that housing assocations are not allowed to register projects with social work departments. Hitherto, the Housing Corporation has imposed an embargo on their registration—it was set out in Scottish guidance note No. 3/79 in 1979. It was considered that housing associations' responsibilities should properly be limited to providing accommodation and that it was not their responsibility to provide any high degree of care or support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The running costs of housing associations care establishments are calculated on the assumption that tenants receive higher DHSS allowances. The amendment seeks to remedy some of the difficulties that that assumption causes. Certain housing association projects provide a high degree of care and support that the DHSS has agreed to pay. That leaves the matter in an anomalous mess.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The DHSS regulations were changed, in 1985. The Government made the changes, because they were trying to restrict the costs involved, but they only managed to create an even more technically complicated regime. Since 1985 housing association projects have been under pressure to be registered in order to obtain a higher DHSS allowance. That will eventually result in them being accountable to and monitored by both regional social work departments and Scottish Homes. The social work department could, for example, demand changes to the structure of a proposed building that had already fulfilled Housing Corporation or Scottish Homes criteria, but would not be responsible for funding the alterations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We have moved from a Room without pictures into a Room with pictures. We have on our right a picture of some stupid English Liberal and on our left Gladstone's Cabinet. At least there is a knight of the thistle on the wall opposite. It is nice for us to discuss housing surrounded by people who knew very little about the subject, but were members of a Liberal Cabinet that took the view that whether they had houses or not, the tarts of London should be looked after.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Judging by the outburst that we have just heard, perhaps, after all, the Committee would benefit from a stint of jogging.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the lights went out, I was saying that since 1985 when the Department of Health and Social Security regulations changed, housing associations have been under pressure to register their projects in order to obtain higher allowances from the DHSS. The consequence would be that they would have to register their projects with regional social work departments and also with Scottish Homes. Social work departments would be able to demand changes in the structures of buildings that had already fulfilled the criteria laid down by the Housing Corporation or Scottish Homes, but would not be responsible for funding those alterations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another complication, particularly for national housing associations, is that each of the 13 social work departments currently has its own standards for registration. Housing associations are not monitored in terms of the service element that they provide, but they would welcome support and monitoring. They have nothing to fear from the additional monitoring that the amendment would provide. However, they are apprehensive about being accountable to two masters. Therefore, the amendment proposes that Scottish Homes should take on the responsibility for registration and that the establishment of standards approved for the care element should be agreed as a result of full consultation either with COSLA or the Association of Directors of Social Work. The housing associations accept that. If Scottish Homes accepted that responsibility, housing associations would employ people who were properly qualified and experienced in the monitoring of the service of care provision that they sought to provide and sustain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are both finely focused amendments. They seek to achieve limited and specific ends, but would contribute substantially toward the aims and objectives alluded to by the hon. Member for East Kilbride—for example, an increased emphasis on community care. If the Minister cannot accept the technical amendments, I hope that he will at least give some thought to achieving their aims.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross drew attention to the fact that we have flitted into different surroundings. He said that there were no pictures on the wall in the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>206</span>
other Room, but if he had looked over his shoulder he would have seen a fine portrait of Richard Cobden—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] Adam Smith has come to life—I shall return to the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth) in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with what the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross said about the decor in this Room. I join him in paying tribute to the late Sir Robin Cooke for the way in which the interiors of the apartments in this Palace have been redecorated in the style of the original design. However, I feel oppressed by the portraits of Liberals. I find them depressing, although not as depressing as the prospect of a portrait of the hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Mr. Maclennan) appearing on one of these walls in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross also said that the state of the Room was a bit tatty. It has been left like a midden by our colleagues considering the Health and Medicines Bill, as I see from the papers that they have left here. That is the lead-in to the debate. As the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Stirling, is responsible for health and medicine in Scotland—an alarming and scarey thought for the Scottish people—it is no bad thing that he is present to pay attention to our debate. It was introduced by my hon. Friend the Member for East Kilbride (Mr. Ingram), and the arguments were reinforced by the hon Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government intend to transfer into the community people who are currently being cared for within the Health Service. I am sure that we all agree with that policy. It must be good for elderly or mental patients in hospital care or institutions to be cared for in the community, near to their families, rather than being far from home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To that end, the Government are going round Scotland trying to close hospitals and trying to turf people out of geriatric and psychiatric hospitals. The idea is that such people will be better cared for in the community—and, indeed, they could be, were it not for the fact that the Government have failed to recognise that more resources will be necessary to provide, for example, back-up services such as home helps, community nursing and doctors. It would be helpful if the Under-Secretary could participate in this debate as he is supposed to be responsible for those affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not only is further provision necessary for the direct support of patients in the community, but specialist provision of housing for such people should be part and parcel of that package. That is where Scottish Homes should be involved, if it is to be the agency by which the Government will co-ordinate the thrust of their housing policy in the nation, in partnership with local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know from my constituency experience that local authorities, in partnership with housing associations, are striving to provide suitable accommodation in the community for elderly people and those with mental handicaps or illness. We want more of that. However, if Scottish Homes is to be the great leader in housing provision and planning, it should be directly involved
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0192">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>207</span>
in consultations about policy implementation. That is why we have proposed the amendments, and why organisations such as the Scottish Council for Single Homeless has asked us to put forward such suggestions. I have no doubt that it, Shelter, the National Campaign for the Homeless and others have made similar representations to the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government policy on community care for elderly people, the mentally ill and handicapped, and others currently being cared for in hospital is extremely important. There is general concensus that, whenever possible, such people should be looked after in the community. We all support that. The amendments seek to ensure better provision for them when they are in the community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I demonstrated, by the pictures around us, that people who are incredibly well-served, such as those in the portrait of Gladstone's Cabinet, find it easy to say, "Somebody else ought to pay for other people". That is an offensive philosophy. That portrait illustrates that it is easy to say, "I'm fine; somebody else pay for them." I know that the hon. Member East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson), for whom I have great affection, does not have that attitude, but it is an easy answer to give. It is also easy to say that the ordinary person should provide the funds, to get rid of the social guilt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Home-Robertson: I would love to enter into a debate on the points that the hon. and learned Gentleman raised, but it would be difficult to stay in order and not stray from the amendments. I am not sure whether the hon. and learned Gentleman identifies himself as a Victorian Liberal and I wonder how that would square with his support for a 20th century Thatcherite Tory party, especially with its proposal for the poll tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is possible and right to operate taxation, social security and social service systems whereby those who can afford to contribute to society can do so in a way that will support needier people, particularly those who are ill, elderly and disadvantaged. We are talking about one aspect of the Bill that is connected with the thrust of Government policy on community care. If we want community care, we also need the resources, planning and everything else that must go with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not good enough to close hospital wards and chase people on to the streets and back to their neighbourhoods—they need to be provided for. They may need nursing and home help support. They need the right type of accommodation—the right flats, houses or sheltered housing. Our amendments help to ensure that such provision is made. There is no need for us to enter a party-political debate on such issues and I hope that the Minister will respond positively—although when I last said that it did not get me anywhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The hon. Member for East Kilbride spoke to amendment No. 103 on community care and other matters related to social work. Amendment No. 119 draws attention to joint planning, especially that between health boards and social work authorities directed towards care in the community. That is an important process to which I am sure that Scottish Homes can make a valuable contribution. I am certain that a statutory obligation would not assist and would lead to the usual problems of definition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am interested in this subject because I was the only Scotish Member on the Committee that considered the Health and Social Services and Social Security Adjudications Bill in 1983; which dealt with the principle of care in the Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We support community care wholeheartedly. However, the main bodies concerned in this must be the social work authority with the support of the health board. I expect Scottish Homes to join in this work and perhaps bring an improved focus to the housing input into the relationship with health and social work. It will be able to build on the fact that housing associations have already become closely involved in this field. In that connection, I understand that Amendments Nos. 100 and 101 have been suggested by the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations. I am conscious of the positive motives which have led them to do so, but I think we must bear in mind that there are other views to consider. I doubt very much whether the amendments would be welcomed by the regional or islands councils, which have statutory duties in this area as social work authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This problem has raised its head in Dundee. We know that everyone supports the concept of community care, and that the regional council is anxious to fulfil its statutory functions in community care—as are the health boards. But there are genuine difficulties.

The Upper Dens project in Dundee was officially opened by the Secretary of State for Scotland. He gave it great praise, and said that it was a marvellous project. That project involves housing people in converted flats, providing family houses, sheltered housing for the elderly and housing for single people. Furthermore, the Gowrie housing association has within the complex a unit providing housing for the mentally handicapped.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The association is finding it extremely difficult to maintain revenue funding for the type of workers needed to support the mentally handicapped. The social work department is under severe budgetary pressure, and has other commitments, so is often unable to give the necessary revenue support. The Gowrie housing association is housing based, and provides care workers; it needs help, and Scottish Homes would be the ideal agency to provide it. Surely the Minister could give way on the amendment? The matter is practical, not political. The housing associations are making a plea to the Minister to listen to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two separate matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member mentioned that the Secretary of State had visited the Upper Dens project. I understand that representations were made to him, and that they are being looked at. If the hon. Gentleman has any particular questions, would he put them in writing and I shall follow them up? I am going to Dundee shortly, and I look forward to seeing numerous activities. I visited the Whitefield estate in the summer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be delighted to welcome the Minister to Dundee. If he could do something to recover the Tory vote in Dundee, it might help me against the Scottish National party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be treading on dangerous ground if I were to say that the hon. Gentleman could offer similar assistance in my constituency, where the Labour party is in third position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whilst housing associations are substantial providers of supported accommodation, and are certainly, and rightly, in the forefront of new ideas and provision, they are not the main resource in this field. There are many private residential homes and charitable bodies which are not housing associations. It is, I suggest, desirable that one authority be in a position to take a strategic view of provision in any area, and it is right, in present circumstances, that this be the social work authority, with the support of the health authorities. I cannot see that making one element of the provision deal with another body is in the interests of those for whom they care. But that is not to say that I dismiss the difficulties of bodies in co-ordinating funding and other aspects of that work. Scottish Homes will have a real part to play in co-ordinating funding and may ultimately assist in the development of simplified arrangements, but that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>210</span>
is for the future. Scottish Homes' powers, functions and general thrust are adequate for the purpose, and the amendments would achieve nothing extra.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the idea is taken further, I suggest that those who tabled the amendments should invite representatives of local authorities to discuss them. In the meantime, I hope that the hon. Gentleman is prepared to withdraw his amendment, otherwise I must ask the Committee to reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have heard the Minister's comments in defence of the Bill, but they contained nothing to convince me that the Bill will enhance or encourage provision for the mentally handicapped. I have had eight years' experience in working with and housing the mentally handicapped.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister criticised housing associations and said that they were not the main resource, but housing conditions in Scotland are so much worse than in England because there is a lack of resources and commitment. In 1980, the Government gave revenue grants to housing associations, local authorities and health boards involved in setting up housing for the mentally handicapped in England and Wales. Those were 100 per cent. grants and were given for up to 10 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scotland has never had that equality of provision. As the present arrangements for revenue funding are for less than 100 per cent. and social work departments and health boards, which are in the incompetent hands of the Under-Secretary, are already stretched, it is difficult to persuade housing associations and others to provide housing for the mentally handicapped, the mentally ill and the elderly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want a more equitable allocation of resources for Scotland. The Scottish Home and Health Department has not promoted the same provision for the mentally handicapped and other important groups as has been provided south of the Border. That meant that, by 1985, provision for the mentally handicapped was four times less than that available in England and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1972, the Scottish Home and Health Department produced a report on services for the mentally handicapped. It snowed that 8,300 places were needed for mentally handicapped people. By 1982, 6,100 such places were needed in hospitals and 2,200 in the community, yet, by 1987, provision for the mentally handicapped, either in hospitals or in the community, had declined below those figures. There were 6,000 places in hospitals but nowhere near 2,200 places in the community. The Government presided over a regime that made 600 fewer places available in the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to deal with the problems of under-resourcing and the lack of commitment. The clause gives no encouragement to organisations and housing associations responsible for housing the mentally handicapped. The Government should ensure that the Bill provides for proper funding and that Scotland is given equal status with England and Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 10, in page 2, leave out lines 11 and 12.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We approach paragraph (g) with fear and apprehension because one thing that we have learned about this Government is their tendency toward centralisation and the elimination of local democracy. The disgraceful attitude toward Scottish education that they showed in today's discussion gives further evidence of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is a classic example of conferring all-embracing powers on a single source. Will the Minister define "general functions" and what the purpose of the clause is? What will develop in future? What powers will the Government give to Scottish Homes to further erode local democracy's housing functions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of this subsection is clarification. Clause 1 is intended to be a full description of the functions of Scottish Homes, and we should be subject to criticism if there were not an attempt to bring together in one place in the Bill as complete a description as possible of the bounds of the operations of Scottish Homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That said, it is possible to argue that paragraph (g), which the amendment proposes should be removed, is not vital. It simply establishes that Scottish Homes' functions are to include other functions conferred upon it by the Bill and by any other enactment. For example, Part III of the Bill gives Scottish Homes the function of approving landlords for the purpose of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>212</span>
"tenants' choice". That function exists to give some protection to tenants who seek to transfer their homes away from their existing public sector landlords. That function, which we shall undoubtedly discuss later, is not within the other functions described in clause 1, and we consider it prudent to make some reference to this in clause 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would remove words which, although they are not vital, add a sense of completeness to the functions of Scottish Homes. They exist for the avoidance of doubt, and I am sure that this is a matter which the hon. Member for East Kilbride (Mr. Ingram) will appreciate is helpful. I hope therefore that he will agree to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not intend to take part in the debate. However this seems to be an instance of sloppy draftsmanship in including a totally redundant paragraph in the Bill. The Minister said that it was here to give a sense of completeness. He has just rejected the prospect of a house condition survey and of joint planning, yet he wants the two lines,
	<br><q><p>"such other general functions as are conferred upon Scottish Homes by or under this Act or any other enactment",</p></q>
to be included in the Bill. Either a function is there or it is not. If it is in the Bill, what is the point of having those two lines? If it is in any other Act, it will be added by definition. Two lines are to be put in a Bill which are absolutely meaningless. I am getting quizzical looks from the Minister's advisers, but I believe that they are burdening the statute book unnecessarily. The Minister is not looking for a sense of completeness; this is simply sloppy drafting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Although we shunted along one Room, I see no reason why the Health and Medicines Bill and amendments to it should be the only documents available to those of us who are considering this Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

[	<i>Interruption</i>] My hon. and learned Friend's words speak for themselves. I hold in my hands an Act of Parliament—the Scottish Development Agency Act 1975—which was put through the House by a Labour Government. One of its subsections reads:
	<br><q><p>"such other functions as are conferred by or under this Act."</p></q>
The wording is virtually identical. If Labour Members wish to condemn the Government for the wording of the Bill, I have to point out that it was perfectly satisfactory when they were in government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home-Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that any Opposition Members were Members of Parliament at that time. However, am I right in thinking that the Minister voted against that Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At that time, we were critical of some of the powers but, since then, we have learnt that the Scottish Development Agency has played an invaluable role.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home-Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But he still voted against it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Labour Members voted against the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Act 1980 although they would now stand by many of those rights in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The words which the amendment proposes to remove are not critical, but are included in the clause for the avoidance of doubt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted that the Minister is prepared to learn from past Labour Governments. I simply wish that he would learn a little more from the beneficial legislation which they introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If paragraph (g) remains in the Bill, does that leave open the door for the provisions of the various amendments which were defeated earlier in Committee? Could such provisions be added at a later stage through negotiation between housing associations, local authorities and the Government themselves? I refer in particular to amendment No. 100 which provides for Scottish Homes to take on the function of providing and assisting housing associations with supported accommodation. If the clause remains as drafted, could such a provision be added at a later stage on the order of the Secretary of State for Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No Government can bind a future Government about changing the law. However, it is unlikely that what the hon. Gentleman surmises will happen in the immediate future. The provision can relate only to functions conferred by Parliament through statute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to the Scottish Development Agency Act 1975. When the legislation was in Committee, I do not know whether the

Opposition opposed the provision which the Minister mentioned. If they did, clearly they were an inadequate Opposition because they failed in their attempts to remove the clause. Given that we are currently somewhat light in numbers on the Opposition Benches—because of the pressing engagements of some of my hon. Friends—I shall not press the amendment to a Vote. But my earlier comments stand, as indeed, do those of my Hon. Friends the Members for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) and Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) about our attempts to include provisions which the Minister and the Government have resisted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 50, in page 2, line 12, at end add—
	<br><q><p>'(h) approving and monitoring the allocation policies of all registered housing associations and all persons and bodies to whom it provides financial assistance;'.</p></q>
The amendment goes to the heart of one aspect of the Bill—that is the damage which would be done to people's chances of obtaining housing which is appropriate for their needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would introduce an allocations policy which, surely, should receive all-party agreement. Members of Parliament recognise that one problem is the allocation of housing to many groups which, even now, find difficulty in obtaining mainstream housing. We contend that the Bill, as drafted, will make the allocation of housing to such groups even more fraught with difficulty. The people whom I have in mind are often those on whom the private sector has turned its back.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill provides no system for allocation on the ground of need. Instead, it introduces allocation on a market basis—that is, the allocation of properties to those who can afford to pay the market price for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A constituent of mine who came to my last ward interview at the weekend suffers from a heart condition and has the highest degree of medical priority. The local authority is seeking to allocate a house to him under its scheme, which is based on housing need. Under the Bill, if such a person approached a private landlord, or even a public sector landlord or housing association without an allocations policy as drafted in the amendment, he might not get past the door, and would certainly not get past the interview.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know from the past that discriminatory policies have been applied by landlords in the allocation of houses. Section 19 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 sought to ensure that no one could be refused admission to waiting lists on certain crucial grounds—for example, age. It became an offence to prevent someone under 21 or under 18 from seeking housing. The income of the applicant or his family could no longer rightly be taken into account. If the tenant was already an owner-occupier, he could not be discriminated against. That
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0196">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>215</span>
is an important aspect, especially in my constituency. Many people applying to housing lists are owner-occupiers and are elderly or have the misfortune to suffer from industrial or other diseases, which make their present properties unsuitable if the properties are not on the ground floor. Often, people cannot return from hospital to their old home which they own and have to seek alternative accommodation from the council or a housing association. The amendment would prevent discrimination against such people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a fourth category, depending on whether the applicant lives in the same area as the private landlord or housing association or tenants' cooperative operates. In Edinburgh there has been a shift in population from city centre areas like The Pleasance to make way for grandiose road schemes that never materialised. At present, those who moved to outlying areas and want to move back have a chance of securing housing that is being built by Edinburgh district council, or from one of the housing associations operating in The Pleasance. The Bill is not clear whether discriminatory practices could be introduced. The amendment ensures that they could not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that the reason that none of those grounds is included or outlawed by the Bill is that that would restrict the potential attractiveness for private landlord developers. No one would contend that all landlord in the private sector are unscrupulous, but the Bill would open the way for unscrupulous private sector landlords to exploit the loophole that we seek to close. It would allow them to attract only those families or individuals who have a reasonably high income and who do not require ground floor housing because of disability or medial need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister knows—and he takes pride in it—local authority housing stock is declining. The stock suitable for disabled people is declining more rapidly than that in other sectors. We know from our studies in Edinburgh that one of the detrimental effects of the Tenants' Rights, etc. (Scotland) Act 1980 has been to encourage the sale of main-door housing. More than half the houses that have been sold in Edinburgh since the implementation of the Act have been of the main-door type. More than 70 per cent. of the houses have main doors or are on the ground floor. Those are the houses that are sought by people with top medical priority—of whom there are more than 500 in Edinburgh at present—and the elderly and disabled. That market is shrinking more rapidly than would be expected by the number of council house sales because it forms a disproportionate amount of the sale stock.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman used two phrases—mainstream housing and main-door housing. What do they mean?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman says that the phrases are jargon, but I believe that the Government use them—the Minister will correct me if I am wrong. Mainstream housing—[	<i>Interuption.</i>] I have not been presented with any early-day motions or other devices to change the jargon. I presume that as the Minister and his hon. Friends have been happy to put up with it so far, they now have nothing better to do than to raise minor points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mainstream housing is housing that is suitable for the majority of the population—people who are fortunate enough to have families without handicapped children, for example. It meets general needs, but not the specific needs of very elderly or young and vulnerable groups. If the hon. and learned Gentleman does not know what main-door housing is, I presume that it is because he lives in the sort of property that may have a drawbridge and a yett.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a good Galloway word for a fortified gate, which the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross may need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The gist of the amendment is that there will be no reason for private landlords to set aside ground floor accommodation for disabled people, as housing associations and local authorities do now. Instead, the Bill will encourage private landlords and others to supply housing at a profit to the deteriment of those who need specialist housing. I encourage Conservative Members to consider the needs of minority groups, which deserve the extra help and positive discrimination that an allocations policy would provide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is useful to distinguish the two propositions in the amendment. The first is the extension of the functions of Scottish Homes to include approval of the allocations policies of registered housing associations and to make explicit the existing implicit monitoring role that it will inherit from the Housing Corporation in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second is the imposition of an identical framework of approval and monitoring on all other bodies receiving financial assistance from Scottish Homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to deal first with the effect on housing associations. As my opening remarks have already implied, the amendment is, in part, unnecessary. The Bill continues the existing arrangements for the monitoring of allocations policies of registered housing associations. Section 21 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 places duties on registered housing associations to prepare, publish and maintain allocations policies. There is a requirement to notify the Housing Corporation and relevant local authorities of such policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 7 of schedule 2 to the Bill will amend the reference to the Housing Corporation to include one to Scottish Homes, so that registered housing
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0197">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>217</span>
associations will have to inform the new body of their allocations rules and policies. The Housing Corporation uses, and Scottish Homes would use, its position as the recipient of all registered housing associations' published allocation policies to monitor them. No further statutory provision is necessary to allow that to happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conferring an approval function on Scottish Homes in this context would be a major extension of the role currently performed by the Housing Corporation. I do not think that is either appropriate or necessary. One of the virtues of housing associations is their combination of independence from the public sector with a philosophy of social responsibility. We should not interfere with the independence of housing associations more than is necessary. I think that there is clear evidence in relation to allocation policies that there is no such necessity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Federation of Housing Associations has been involved in joint discussions with the Housing Corporation about minimum standards and best practice in relation to allocations. The product of these discussions has been a consultation document issued to housing associations and I understand that, in the light of housing associations' responses, the Housing Corporation expects to issue guidance before long. This voluntary co-operation in a system of self regulation is characteristic of the responsible attitude of the housing association movement and provides clear evidence that new statutory controls are not needed. I understand that the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations is opposed to the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>218</span>
An apparatus of control which is inappropriate to the housing associations is much more inappropriate to other housing providers which Scottish Homes assists. I have already dealt with the relevant arguments about Scottish Homes' relationship to those other than registered housing assiciations to which it provides financial assistance in relation to an earlier group of amdendments. The Committee has accepted them and I think it is unnecessary to repeat them. I will simply add, as a point of information, that I envisage that the contractual conditions imposed by Scottish Homes in conjunction with financial assistance may include some reference to allocation matters in some cases. I hope that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths) will accept that his amendment is in part unnecessary and inappropriate and will seek leave to withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
