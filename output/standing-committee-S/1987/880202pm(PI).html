	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed [this day]:</i> No. 51, in page 2, line 12, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(h) funding, providing, and assisting in the provision of a programme to eliminate and prevent the problems of dampness and condensation within the housing stock.'.—	<i>[Mr. Nigel Griffiths.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is clear that the Government will not accept the amendment they believe, as they did in the 1970s, that the people responsible for dampness are tenants themselves, and that they should be responsible for paying for it. That means that they support the increase in rents to £28. The Secretary of State for the Environment in England has said that such an increase would be supported by Government Members; and the tenants themselves would get the old advice, "Do not have baths, do not breathe, do not have sex", and all the other things said by Conservative councillors and Members of Parliament in the 1970s. In the 1980s, they are again to blame for this problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members are keen on photographs. We have seen one of them on the back of an elephant. We have also seen the Minister responsible for housing photographed with a man with a suit. It was not his tailor, but a publicity stunt for the Select Committee in 1984, when he was photographed with a man showing him a suit rotting with damp mould. He plainly felt no compassion for the plight of that family. He did not learn the lesson then. It is clear that the lairds who used to run the Tory party have been ousted and replaced by the louts, and compassion does not figure in the loutish circles in which the Minister now moves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister responsible for health has had nothing to say on this important debate, when we tied dampness with health. We know that the priorities of his party lie with giving people the choice between holidays or hospitals, decorating or dentists, and they want people to choose disease and dampness by rejecting the amendment. We shall press it to a vote, and hope that those hon. Members who do not support us will rue the day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to give some more information on below tolerable standards. The hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) was given a comprehensive reply on 30 October 1987, and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>262</span>
	<i>Hansard</i> at that time set out, district by district, the houses below tolerable standards as on 31 March 1987, from the returns of local authorities. From that parliamentary answer, the hon. Gentleman will see that there was a very small number in the public sector compared with the considerable numbers in the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Below tolerable standard houses are almost all privately owned, and are either owner-occupied or privately tenanted. About 2 per cent. of the total housing stock is now below the tolerable standard, and the figure has been reduced by more than half since 1979. The latest figure is 55,000, based on local authority returns for March 1987; 57,000 was an early analysis of the same but incomplete data. The data were completed recently, revealing a final figure of 55,000. The figures which I gave this morning have dropped steadily from 150,000 in 1977 to the figure for 1987 which I have already given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The number of houses of below tolerable standard has come down in large measure due to the work of the housing associations and to improvement grants. The big difference is that in past decades, progress was achieved through demolition and slum clearance. In the present decade, there has been considerable emphasis on the renewal and improvement of houses, and of keeping communities intact, which has been of substantial benefit to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Part (d) of the question which was answered on 30 October 1987 asked the Secretary of State for Scotland to
	<br><blockquote><p>"estimate the cost of carrying out the necessary repairs and improvements".—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 30 October 1987; Vol. 121, c. 	<i>494.</i>]</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister say why that part of the question was not answered?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman looks at the record, he will see that there are separate answers dealing with dampness only, condensation only, condensation and dampness and total condensation. So full information was given in table 20.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must understand that tables accompany the text. He should look at the answer as a whole, and he will find the information that he requires.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should have a serious debate on dampness and condensation—a subject in which you, Mr. Lambie, have taken considerable interest in the past. I think that you were present when the photograph to which the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths) referred was taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Dampness and condensation is a serious problem, and the Government have provided considerable resources in addition to the ordinary allocation of resources to enable local authorities to tackle it. However, I do not accept the idea that Scottish Homes should take over the responsibilities of local authorities. Scottish Homes will instead assist as a willing, ready and able partner. We all recognise the importance of action to eradicate dampness and condensation, and the Bill is already adequate to achieve that purpose. The amendment is therefore unnecessary, and I ask hon. Members not to press it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall comment briefly on some of the observations made by Opposition Members, especially on my earlier comments.

The hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths) has a distinguished and honourable political name, although he may not be everyone's darling, and he seems to have some odd ideas about the background and interests of Conservative Members. Conservative Members bring to the Committee direct experience of organising and running these matters, so the hon. Gentleman's comments were rather odd, I thought, especially those about my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton), who comes from one of the most distinguished and honourable families in Scotland. It seems that when Opposition Members cannot produce satisfactory answers—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Lambie. I am having great difficulty in following what the hon. Gentleman is saying. Can he help us?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I never have any problems. I am sure that you are following what I say Mr. Lambie. The hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) has always had great difficulties. He is not quite one of us; he does not quite follow what is going on. He is always wandering round with a blank stare on his face, I think because he is never sure which political group he belongs to; nor is he very sure why he does what he does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that the hon. Gentleman's comments were out of order, and not the sort of comment that one would expect to be made on a political matter. When Opposition Members run out of political arguments, they go in for personal abuse, which I find offensive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I still have not discovered what the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) was havering about, but he evidently felt strongly about it. If he feels better for having delivered himself of that speech, it will be conducive to positive consideration as we proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was grateful to the Minister for reminding me about the reply that he gave me on 30 October. He still seems to cling to the childlike belief that the statistics that the Scottish Office possesses about the condition of houses in Scotland are spot-on accurate. I will give one example from the list to which the Minister has referred in relation to Argyll and Bute district, where apparently 4,180 private sector houses are below the tolerable standard. That is a record figure for the whole of Scotland, second only to Edinburgh. But there is not a single one in the public sector. To have such wildly varying figures from different districts demonstrates amply the fact that the data have not been collected on a uniform or rational basis. The Minister has confirmed what we have been saying: that there is a need for a more satisfactory approach in relation to dampness or anything else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that we can now vote on the amendment. I have been led to believe that it is unlikely that we shall have a clause stand part debate. May I take this opportunity, therefore, to put on record the reason why my hon. Friends and I propose to vote against clause stand part? It is connected with the Minister's approach to the amendment and to several other amendments that have been debated. We made it clear at the outset that we were
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>264</span>
not opposed in principle to the establishment of a national co-ordinating agency for housing and that we came to the Committee with an open mind in relation to the prospects for Scottish Homes. However, we have had this opportunity to consider what the Government have in mind as a function for Scottish Homes, and we have heard the Minister refuse repeatedly to make it clear that the Government intend to give important functions to Scottish Homes, whether in relation to conducting a house condition survey, or in relation to conducting a proper campaign against the evil of dampness in Scotland. The Minister is clearly determined that Scottish Homes should not perform any useful function but should simply be there to make mischief for local housing authorities. For those reasons, we shall vote against clause 1.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
As hon. Members are aware, clauses 3(1) and 4(5) automatically vest the assets and liabilities of the SSHA and the Housing Corporation in Scotland in Scottish Homes. That is a straightforward vesting and there is therefore no document to be stamped. The provision in paragraph 20 exempting the transaction from stamp duty is therefore unnecessary.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This straightforward amendment strikes at the heart of the public accountability of this new quango known as Scottish Homes. I wait with interest to see whether the Government are prepared to accept it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's record on accountability over the years has been deplorable, but I do not intend to go into their gagging of the press and the broadcasting media, not only recently but over the years. We know the Government's tendency to gag when their activities are exposed by the media. It is the lack of desire for open
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>266</span>
government which leads me to conclude that the Government will not accept the amendment. That is why I said that I await with interest the Minister's response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting to compare the Government's gagging approach to the media with their desire to impose the Local Government (Access to Information) Act 1985 on local authorities in Scotland. That Act was largely unnecessary in many ways. Local authorities in Scotland already operated in an open and democratic manner. The press could freely report most of the proceedings of local authorities. The public were guaranteed access to committees and council meetings, confidential matters excepted, and in recent years the very success of Labour-controlled authorities in Scotland has been because of the closeness of those authorities to the people whom they represent and to the services that they provide—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth), mutters "Strathclyde" from a sedentary position. That is the first comment that he has made in the Committee. The Minister is willingly supporting the Government in some of their actions in gagging the press and the broadcasting media generally. If the Under-Secretary of State has something to say on this issue I hope that he will stand up and say it instead of muttering under his breath.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If anything, the affairs of local government are under-reported in the press. That is not because of restrictions imposed by local authorities. Indeed, new legislation is trying to stop local authorities properly publicising the activities in which they are involved. There is not much reporting about what local authorities do because, by and large, what local authorities are doing—certainly Labour-controlled authorities—is good news, and the press and the broadcasting media do not publicise good news because it is not sexy enough. They turn their face against the good news and look for the sensational. But we have to live with that. I was a local councillor for seven and a half years. Local authorities in Scotland have a good record of opening their doors to the press and the public to try to attain a better understanding of what is happening in those authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why should that Act apply to Scottish Homes? It seems axiomatic that, as a publicy funded body, Scottish Homes should make all its records and minutes available to the public. The public are paying for this organisation and they should have access to what it is doing. It is especially important for a quango that is not democratically elected. We shall come to the make-up of Scottish Homes later, but as the Bill stands there is no democratic accountability and no democratic election of members of the board, who will be looking after vast sums of public money and the interests of tens of thousands of tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As an example of the type of information to which the public or tenants of Scottish Homes should have access, why should not the records relating to approved landlords in the terms of the Bill be made available to tenants when they are deciding whether to exercise their choice under the pick-a-landlord scheme? If the board of Scottish Homes is prepared to approve a landlord, why should not the discussions as minuted, which will be a matter of record when a landlord has been approved, be available for inspection by the tenants of Scottish Homes? The Government have a deplorable track record over a wide range of Government activities in resisting public access to information. In an equivalent quango in Scotland, the New Towns Corporation, the Government have not been

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>267</span>
falling over themselves to ensure that the activities of that organisation are open to the tens of thousands of people who live in new towns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg), who has been putting pressure on the Government, fully supported by an organisation called SLANT, or Scottish Local Authorities with New Towns. The five district councils which have new towns within their borders, along with my hon. Friend the Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth, have been trying to force the development corporations to open their board meetings to the press and public. Only limited success has been achieved in that area, and not because the Government want it to happen. The Government have the powers to instruct the corporation boards to do it, but have steadfastly refused. Because Labour Members have a say, and people sympathetic to the idea of public access serve on the boards of development corporations, two development corporation boards have opened their doors to the press and public to a limited extent. They are Livingston and Glenrothes. The other new towns have refused to do so. They have not been encouraged in any substantial way by the Government to open their activities to public access. That is why I am pessimistic about the Government's willingness to accept the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see from the amendment paper that amendment No. 105 has not been selected. With your indulgence, Mr. Lambie, I will mention an aspect of that amendment, without speaking specifically to it. I should be interested to hear whether the Minister intends to apply the provisions of the Public Bodies (Admission of the Press to Meetings) Act 1960. I quote from the Second Reading of that Bill, on 5 February 1960. The hon. Member moving it said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the second place, I quote from the Report of the Franks Committee.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>'Publicity is the greatest and most effective check against any arbitrary action.'</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>That is one of the fundamental rights of the subject. Further, publicity stimulates the interest of local persons in local government. That is also very important."</p></blockquote>
For "local government" we might read public body, quango, Scottish Homes, or Scottish new towns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Elsewhere in that Second Reading debate, the same hon. Member says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I hope that it is evident from what I have said that we are trying very hard to put into the form of legislation a code of practice that will safeguard the rights of the public … I hope that hon. Members will think fit to give this Bill a Second Reading, and to consider that the paramount function of this distinguished House is to safeguard civil liberties rather than to think that administrative convenience should take first place in law."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 5 February 1960, Vol. 616, c. 1351–8.]</p></blockquote>
It was an obscure Back-Bench Member who moved the Second Reading of that Bill, as a maiden speech. That obscure Back-Bench Member became the Prime Minister. It was the right hon. Member for Finchley (Mrs. Thatcher) who used those words and arguments. The sentiments expressed then must hold good today. Is the Minister at least prepared to apply the 1960 legislation, if not the 1985 legislation in its full force and vigour? The Ministers who represent the Government in Scotland do not have the backbone to stand against their Prime Minister, and she
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>268</span>
would be less than happy if her fine sentiments were thwarted because Ministers did not support the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to support the amendment moved comprehensively by the hon. Member for East Kilbride (Mr. Ingram). I agree with everything that he said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to speak briefly to amendments Nos. 61 and 65 in my name. As the Committee will see, amendment No. 61 seeks the Government's acceptance, first that
	<br><blockquote><p>"minutes will be kept at every meeting of Scottish Homes and of every meeting of any committee established by Scottish Homes"</p></blockquote>
and, secondly, that
	<br><blockquote><p>"copies of Scottish Homes minutes shall be made available for public inspection at the offices of Scottish Homes and at the offices of every district and Islands Council in Scotland."</p></blockquote>
Amendment No. 65 is an attempt to persuade the Government to accept that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the provisions of the Public Bodies (Admission to Meetings) Act 1960 and the Local Government (Access to Information) Act 1986 shall apply to Scottish Homes and its committees as they apply to local authorities."</p></blockquote>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my typical way I have been too modest by half. As I was listening to the way in which amendment No. 106, the hon. Member for East Kilbride introduced amendment No. 106, it occurred to me that I could easily have adverted to my private Member's Bill which became an Act last year—the Access to Personal Files Act 1987. As the Minister will know, the Government are allegedly engaged in consultations to have local authority housing records made available to the public on demand under that Act. If I had been quick-witted enough to spot it earlier, I should have sought to extend that Act, which covers local authority housing records, to embrace Scottish Homes. Although it is technically not in the amendments as tabled, perhaps the Minister could consider that in his remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There was nothing about that in the hon. Gentleman's election address.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must not be tempted to discuss my election address.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two main points have been argued eloquently by the hon. Member for East Kilbride. First, if Scottish Homes is to be a publicly funded body, it is right that all its records and minutes should be made available to the public. It is expecially important for a body like this which will not be democratically elected that every possible step is taken to guarantee accountability whenever possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again the Government are making much of the parallels between Scottish Homes and the Scottish Development Agency. I am not an expert, on it, but as far as I know the SDA is very good at making some of its minutes available. It deals to a greater extent with commercial contracts and grants, some of which are commercially sensitive, but if the SDA has established practices of making its business transactions as widely available as possible surely that parallel could be extended to Scottish Homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, to reinforce what the hon. Member for East Kilbride said, records relating to approved landlords would be extremely useful for tenants deciding whether to exercise their tenant's choice rights. I agree that that is fundamentally important information without which the Bill may not achieve the Government's aims. It is an easy
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0227">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>269</span>
step for the Government to take, and there would be no difficulties. I imagine that there would be a small administrative on-cost for the duplication and transmission of the minutes, which might be a factor. Has the Minister any estimate of how much extra those provisions would cost, if anything? Unless I am told something different, I do not see how the cost could be used as an argument to rebut the hon. Gentleman's case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to amendments Nos. 61 and 65, which are in my name, it is essential that there is public access to the minutes of Scottish Homes. The whole tenor of its work will be determined by the way in which it conducts its business. My experience is that committees that are subjected to the rigour of public scrutiny and examination when they are deciding the merits and demerits of arguments in the cut and thrust of public debate are much healthier and more robust. Earlier debates showed how some of us fear that Scottish Homes will slide into a commercial, glib, glossy public relations operation conducting its business in private.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like the SDP?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must resist these temptations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Scottish Homes is allowed to do that, it will affect the whole tenor of the way in which it conducts its work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The papers for Scottish Homes meetings should be made available, so that people can study them at their leisure. Many people will have a direct interest in following the detailed arguments contained in the papers and briefings put before the board that will run Scottish Homes and in making sure that the spirit of the Bill is carried out in practice. I see no way of ensuring that that is done unless there is specific and explicit provision for public accessibility to and publication of documents at every stage and in every way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an exceptional case, there may be an argument for doing things below the line for reasons of commercial confidentiality. I am prepared to listen to such arguments, but it should occur only in the most exceptional cases where commercial contracts, sales and purchases or transfers of tenancies might be prejudiced by the premature disclosure of a prospective purchase price or whatever it may be. But in all other respects I cannot see how the Government can set their face against these small but extremely important amendments. They are certainly important to me. I subscribe entirely to the spirit and the content of the remarks of the hon. Member for East Kilbride in introducing the amendments and I hope that the other members of the Committee will pay special attention to this important group of amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) that this is an important set of amendments and I applaud the way in which my hon. Friend the Member for East Kilbride (Mr. Ingram) introduced them. Opposition Members are always hopeful that we shall have a reply from the Minister, but there is not much encouragement for that hope.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is our first opportunity to debate one aspect of schedule 1, which contains a number of important aspects of the constitution and conduct of Scottish Homes, and it is right and proper that the Committee should consider them in some detail. But there are ways and ways of debating matters in Committee. It is a little regrettable that the Government side of the usual channels does not seem
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>270</span>
to be functioning as well as it might. Although we have made it clear that we are prepared to make progress with the consideration of the Bill, we have not had much response from the Government. They appear to be more interested in clocking up hours than in making progress. We are always open for business on these affairs, so hope springs eternal, but until we hear to the contrary, we shall continue to consider the amendments in some detail and to look at every aspect of them very carefully. If the Government seriously want to make progress, they have only to tell us and we might be able to proceed more rapidly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments put the case for the principal affairs of Scottish Homes to be conducted in public and its minutes to be published. It is appropriate that an hon. Member for a new town constituency should have introduced the amendment, because the new towns—Irvine, East Kilbride, Cumbernauld, Glenrothes and Livingston—have suffered from the fact that an important part of their public affairs has been conducted in private by nominated bodies whose proceedings can take place in secret. Therefore, decisions can be taken behind closed doors about the construction, sale and planning of houses and about the strategy of the planning of new towns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a legitimate and understandable fear that something similar will happen with Scottish Homes. We are debating a gigantic new national quango, which is far bigger than any of the new towns has been and has very wide-ranging powers under clause 1. It might be worth recapitulating what those powers are. They include:
	<br><blockquote><p>"providing, and assisting in the provision of, finance … providing, improving, repairing, maintaining and managing housing … promoting the wider ownership of housing by its occupants … promoting the provision and improvement of housing and the improvement of management of housing (whether by its occupants or otherwise);</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>promoting and assisting the development of housing associations, maintaining a register of housing associations … undertaking, and assisting the undertaking of, the development, redevelopment and improvement of the physical, social and recreational environment related to housing",</p></blockquote>
and finally "such other general functions" as may be determined for the Scottish Homes operation. Within that list come a huge range of decisions which affect the day-to-day lives of tenants, residents and whole communities. It cannot be right that there should not even be public understanding of what is going on. We shall come later to the way in which Scottish Homes will be appointed and whether representatives of tenants and members of the public should be involved in selecting the members of the Scottish Homes quango. But even if we concede at this stage that they will be nominated by the Secretary of State for Scotland, a fairly nightmarish prospect in view of his taste in these affairs—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Malcolm Rifkind)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Good taste.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that we have the Secretary of State on the record at last. He says that he has good taste. That is debatable, to put it mildly: it is a very restricted taste. If we look at the quangoes that he has appointed recently and at the qualifications that he regards as relevant for appointing people to any of the hundreds of quangoes to which he makes appointments, it seems that the most important qualification in his mind is fully paid-up membership of the Conservative party in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

British Coal, which owns a substantial quantity of housing stock, decided over the past two years to divest itself of all that housing, having acted as a pretty appalling landlord for many years, failing to maintain the housing and to maintain reasonable contacts and flows of information between it and its tenants. Therefore, there was a great deal of rundown coal board housing stock in mining communities throughout Scotland, and British Coal suddenly decided last year to get rid of it all. First, it offered the properties to the sitting tenants—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The coal board's conduct has been an alarming example of what can take place when a nominated corporate body, controlling people's houses, does not act responsibly or conduct its affairs in ways which enables its tenants and the wider public to know what is going on and influence decisions which affect their lives. Whole communities were put on the market and auctioned off last year in the west end of London, and now tenants do not even know who their landlord is, because some speculator has bought their house or the whole street and they have no control over future decisions affecting their community. If that body had conducted its affairs in public and had enabled its tenants and others involved to influence its decisions, that sort of scandal might have been avoided. I know that the Scottish Special Housing Association was recently besieged by its tenants, who were alarmed at what is likely to happen when Scottish Homes takes over the management of their homes. That is yet another example of the urgent need for such bodies to conduct their affairs in public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I sympathise with my hon. Friend the Member for East Kilbride and my other hon. Friends, including yourself, Mr. Lambie, who are having to deal with a quango in the form of the Commission for the New Towns, which is conducting its affairs in secret. Parliament should not legislate in a way which makes it possible for decisions to be taken on that basis in future. Here we are, setting up this new national quango without any provision requiring it to conduct its affairs in public or even to publish its minutes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested to hear the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire refer to the importance of conducting such affairs in public. I always enjoy reading local newspaper reports about the conduct of the affairs of Roxburgh district council and the rows which take place there. Would it not be nice if it could close the doors and keep the press out and people could be prevented from knowing about the weird antics of Roxburgh district council? I do not know whether I should put it on record,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0229">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>273</span>
but the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire is indicating assent. It might get back to some of his constituents who serve on that local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A similar point might be made about any other district council or regional council in Scotland. Knowing that I am being listened to at present by a member of East Lothian district council, I must say that I suspect that some members of that council, the Tory group in particular, might like a veil to be drawn over some of the things that they say in that council; but it is right that important meetings which determine decisions affecting people's lives should be conducted in public. That happens in local authorities, but apparently there is to be no requirement for it to happen in Scottish Homes. My hon. Friend is right to include the amendment. I welcome the support of the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, although there is no reference to this in his election address, but we shall watch to see that he keeps all his promises made in these proceedings. Perhaps the Minister may be able to assure us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) said that he hoped that the other members of the Committee would treat the amendments seriously. All Opposition members will do that. I hope that Conservative members will be equally serious in the way they treat the amendments, which relate to important points of principle concerning the operation of Scottish Homes. No doubt the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) is paying attention and will be careful to ensure that when I appear with him on Grampian television on Friday he leaves me no scope for attacking him for not treating this part of the debate as seriously as he might.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Everyone will agree with the principle enshrined in the Local Government (Access to Information) Act 1985. People have a right to know about decisions which will affect them directly in their personal lives. In the case of district and regional councils, ratepayers and the consumers of services have a right to know exactly what is going on at sub-committee level and committee level which may directly affect them. That is why not only the minutes and records of those meetings, but even the papers presented to the committees in advance of the meeting are made publicly available to the press and to members of the public if they ask for them. That is an important safeguard. In the modern world, government of all sorts, and the private sector, is becoming increasingly complex. It takes a tremendous effort for people to understand what is going on in the world of work, local government and business, which affects them directly. They should have as much access as possible to information which enables them to understand the decisions that might affect them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That applies to elected bodies such as district and regional councils. It should apply all the more to unelected bodies, as Scottish Homes will be. As my hon. Friend the Member for East Kilbride (Mr. Ingram) said, a great campaign has been conducted in Scotland to bring the new town corporations under the auspices of the Local Government (Access to Information) Act, and that should apply equally to Scottish Homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem of commercially sensitive information was mentioned earlier. On balance, it should not be made available to the public, but there is no real anxiety on that issue. The Minister knows that, under the Local Government (Access to Information) Act, it is possible to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>274</span>
exempt information which may be sensitive, which it would be unwise to make available to the public. A decision is made in the council in consultation with officers that that information is too sensitive for public issue and should be exempt from the stipulations of the Act. Something similar could easily be worked into any proposal to bring Scottish Homes under the umbrella of that Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire mentioned the SDA as a model for Scottish Homes, which gives me some concern. When I was a serving member of the local authority on Tayside, the way in which the SDA involved itself in the local area was not always above criticism. One of the major decisions taken recently in Tayside, which I personally supported throughout, was to go ahead with the large waterfront development in Dundee. I see the ears of the hon. Member for Tayside, North pricking up at this point. This no doubt will appear in the 	<i>Dundee Courier</i> and the 	<i>Evening Telegraph</i> tomorrow, but I shall press on. I always supported the decision when I was on Tayside regional council, but one aspect of it to which I objected was the way in which the SDA conducted itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although up to 40 companies had suggested ways in which the development could go ahead, in the event a short leet was drawn up and a single development proposal was chosen by the SDA, on its own, without consultation with Tayside regional council or Dundee district council. We were left in the position that the SDA came along and said to the local authorities, "This is the decision, take it or leave it." In those circumstances I was for taking it, but I would much rather that the SDA had been accountable, so that we knew the thought processes that had gone into the decision to pick that particular project, so that the local authorities and the people of Dundee and Tayside were kept in the know and everything was done openly and above board in accordance with the best principles of open government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Scottish Homes is to conduct itself in the same manner that the SDA has conducted itself in the past throughout Scotland it would cause concern to everybody. The Minister has been careful so far in to remove from Scottish Homes any responsibility for meeting the acute housing needs in Scotland. We have had debates this morning on dampness and condensation, in which Opposition Members tried to put on to Scottish Homes some responsibility for dealing with that problem, but the Minister was particular about making sure that no such responsibility should be placed on it. He wishes responsibility to lie solely with the local authorities and district councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier we had a debate about homelessness, and again the Minister was careful to ensure that no responsibility was placed on Scottish Homes. Again, he wishes it to lie directly with the local authorities. It has been the same story with almost every amendment moved by the Opposition. The Minister has been determined to keep Scottish Homes free from all responsibility for meeting acute housing need in Scotland. That causes great concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is also suggesting, in accordance with the Bill, that Scottish Homes should have a huge budget for investment in housing. Although it will have money, it will have no responsibility for spending it where it is most needed—on the homeless, to eradicate dampness and condensation, for example, or to deal with the housing stock in general.

I have mentioned already the Glasgow merchant city area. The SDA has become involved, along with the local authorities and other bodies, in promoting the redevelopment of the whole inner city of Glasgow. The housing element of that redevelopment has concerned itself almost exclusively with housing for the yuppies. I remember being shown round the merchant city in Glasgow by the SDA and looking at housing for sale at £30,000 and £40,000, or for rent at a comparable level, which ordinary people with acute housing needs, in Easterhouse, Drumchapel and so on could not afford. It was housing for the upwardly mobile. I remember being shown a local tavern in the merchant city which was for the upwardly mobile, where I was reliably informed that the normal order was "A pint of Guinness and a croissant, landlord". That is what one can expect from that type of development. This is serious because at the same time the SDA and others developing the merchant city were ignoring the housing problems in the peripheral estates of Easterhouse or Drumchapel. The SDA was not prepared to become involved in those areas.

I am concerned that because of the way which the Minister is pushing the Bill through the Committee, Scottish Homes will be in a similar position to the SDA. It will have no responsibility for acute housing need, but will be able to spend its money where and when it likes in local areas, and more than likely where it can make profits for the private sector in providing yuppie housing. It is likely that it will not tackle the real problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
One way to counter that would be to open up the decision-making process of Scottish Homes to public accountability. We should like the members of Scottish Homes to be elected, but the Minister will not allow it. He should at least be prepared to allow them to be publicly accountable through publication of the minutes and advance publication of all the papers and investment proposals that they are considering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It goes further. Under the present legislation, Scottish Homes will take over the management of 83,000 SSHA houses. The Minister conceded at an earlier sitting that Scottish Homes will also be able to receive more than those 83,000 houses, perhaps taking over Glasgow, Dundee or Edinburgh district council houses. The actual housing stock for which Scottish Homes will be directly responsible could go up to 150,000, 200,000 or 250,000 different kinds of house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will individuals gain access to the housing that is under the control of Scottish Homes? I shall develop briefly an important principle that I wish Scottish Homes to apply to the way in which it gives people access to that housing stock. Last night on Granada television a "World in Action" programme revealed the activities of the Economic League. It showed that the Economic League was using spies to infiltrate the trade union movement to obtain information about individual members of that movement and of other political parties. With that information it drew up secret blacklists which were then made available to unnamed companies, which used the blacklists to prevent people being employed by them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Who is to say that Scottish Homes will not avail itself of the services of the Economic League? What is to stop Scottish Homes saying, "If you're a Labour co-ordinating member, a trade unionist or support anti-apartheid, you
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>276</span>
won't get one of our houses"? That may be the case unless the activities of Scottish Homes are opened up to public scrutiny. It is essential for the Minister to accept the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend said that Scottish Homes will probably be the biggest landlord in Scotland. What the Government have in mind for the acquisition of property by Scottish Homes will probably emerge in further debates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know how complicated it can be for people on housing waiting lists to find out how they stand when waiting for a local authority house. It is bad enough if one is dealing with a relatively compact local authority, but what will it be like when there is a nationally administered waiting list for homes to let? How will the house letting scheme operate? Will that be debated in public?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned also about the selling of people's houses over their heads. Alarm has been aroused among SSHA tenants because the Government made it clear at one stage that it was their intention that the new Scottish Homes operation should be flogging off 83,000 houses into the private sector. They are back-tracking on that, but who is to say that it will not happen in future? Who will know to whom the houses are being sold?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a good point. I wish to refer to the prospect of Scottish Homes becoming a national housing agency with houses in all parts of Scotland. How are people to gain access to them right across Scotland rather than in a compact area like Dundee or Glasgow?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recently several constituents have come to me because of intimidation and attacks upon their person and property. They have found it necessary to ask for a housing transfer out of a certain area of Dundee because they have been hounded by individuals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the ways in which district councils can operate is to allow the person to be transferred on management grounds from one area of Dundee to another. Would that apply also to Scottish Homes? Could people in Dundee who are under violent pressure from neighbours apply to Scottish Homes and be granted a house in Aberdeen, Glasgow, Edinburgh or even north Berwick, which I suppose they would take if they had the chance? It is an important issue that must be aired and thrashed out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will people know about the decisions? Will they be taken at board level by the nine wise people who are appointed by the Secretary of State for Scotland? Will they decide whether an individual in Glasgow will get a housing transfer to another Scottish Homes house in Edinburgh? What will be the policy of Scottish Homes? How will the public know what that policy is?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian made a similar point about selling houses over people's heads. How will people know the background of someone who has applied to buy their house? How will they know that Scottish Homes is treating them in good faith and is not trying to force them to opt for a private landlord by not spending sufficient money on their houses? Many sorts of problems arise about the way in which Scottish Homes will conduct itself. The Minister must address those problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat—and shall do so again—that one of the ways to do that is to ensure that Scottish Homes' activities are open to public accountability. The Government have the deserved reputation of being the most centralising
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0231">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>277</span>
Government this century; certainly they are the most authoritarian Government this century. They have done everything they can to destroy local accountability. We have seen the abolition of all sorts of directly elected bodies, the Greater London council and the metropolitan authorities and we understand that they have up their sleeve the abolition of the Inner London education authority, although they are denying it. The new bodies created to replace them are not directly elected, but are often nominated bodies, such as Scottish Homes. That has been brought into the housing sector in Scotland in an attempt to take away from elected authorities their housing stock, which will come under non-elected control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment goes to the heart of accountability. The Minister and Conservative Back Benchers sometimes argue that they are all for accountability and that that is why they have introduced the poll tax. I challenge that assertion. The poll tax has nothing to do with improving the accountability of local councils to their electorates, but has everything to do with trying to destroy the relationship between local authorities and their electorates. Ultimately, it has to do with the destruction of elected local government by setting local electorates and local councils at each others' throats.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the central issue. If we are not allowed to elect the controlling body of a massive organisation such as Scottish Homes, we must at least be allowed to ensure that its activities are open to public scrutiny and are publicly accountable to those who will be affected by them. That is why the amendments must be carried. If the Minister thinks that he is just and fair, he must accept the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to respond to the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion). He raised the question of access to houses of Scottish Homes. Scottish Homes and housing associations funded by Scottish Homes are likely to continue to accept tenants nominated by local authorities just as the SSHA and housing associations do at present. I envisage no change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There were weasel words there, "likely to". What does the hon. Gentleman mean?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may not envisage any changes, but what assurance can he give the Committee that the directors of Scottish Homes will not envisage changes in that policy? They may be free to implement such changes in years ahead, irrespective of what the Minister feels at present.

The hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth) may be the Minister responsible for housing in a few years' time. He would not balk at a change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot envisage the situation in 30 years' time. I hope that by that time many of the housing problems that we have been discussing will have been resolved. It is necessary to have as much flexibility as possible. I envisage that the present relationship and the measures that are in force relating to nomination rights will be maintained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) that there is no question of houses being sold
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>278</span>
over the heads of tenants. All rights of tenants remain safeguarded. We shall return to that issue in a subsequent debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate has been interesting. The hon. Member for East Kilbride (Mr. Ingram) raised the Prime Minister's Bill. Neither Bill relates to new towns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These interesting amendments lead us towards two issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.40 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.</i></p>
	<p>6 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regret that the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) is not here as I wish to mention a point that he raised about how the funds of Scottish Homes will be spent. It is only fair to say that Scottish Homes will use the funds in much the same way as the Housing Corporation does now, concentrating on areas of greatest need through housing associations, and it will continue with its obligations towards all the tenants of the SSHA as before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are interesting amendments. They lead us towards two issues—first, the accountability of Scottish Homes and, secondly, towards the provision of information about its work. The Bill already makes substantial provision towards ensuring that Scottish Homes is fully accountable to the Secretary of State, the Comptroller and Auditor General and Parliament. Clause 11 requires Scottish Homes to keep proper accounts, to submit them to the Secretary of State and thence to the Comptroller and Auditor General for scrutiny. An annual report is to be laid before Parliament. These provisions are similar to those applying both to the Housing Corporation and to the Scottish Development Agency. I am sure that hon. Members will agree that they are proper provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the arrangements proposed in the Bill are a better and more comprehensive means of establishing accountability than public access to the meetings or minutes of the Scottish Homes board or its committees. That would be an incomplete and therefore misleading guide because bodies of that nature take decisions at a variety of levels and a wide variety of decisions may not be taken through formal meetings. A separate and very important point is that much of what is discussed at formal meetings is likely to be inappropriate for public access. The board will be extensively concerned with consideration of commercial matters where commercial confidence often requires to be observed. I am sure that Scottish Homes will work in an open way, but to force it to do so in a statutory fashion runs the risk that its approach to openness will be dictated by the need for procedures geared to the matters which present the greatest difficulty in this respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How have local councils with multi-million-pound contracts suffered from competitive tendering and procedures to safeguard the public with regard to building houses, repairing houses and so forth when their meetings are open to the public extensively? Why should Scottish Homes suffer for adopting a similar approach?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a different type of organisation. The parallel is not with local authorities but with the Housing Corporation, the Scottish Development Agency and other bodies of that character. The Acts

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>279</span>
referred to in amendments Nos. 65, 97 and 106 are designed primarily for local authorities and connected bodies. They are not intended for bodies like Scottish Homes and they do not apply to the Housing Corporation, the SSHA or the SDA, and it would be inappropriate to introduce such provisions in relation to Scottish Homes. For all those reasons, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will seek leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that the Public Bodies (Admission to Meetings) Act 1960 might be appropriate for an organisation such as Scottish Homes? If he says that the 1985 Act is not appropriate, we shall return to that, but is he prepared to accept any Act that opens the proceedings of public bodies to public scrutiny or does he not want the public involved at all in public scrutiny of the expenditure of public money?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The scrutiny is better exercised in a different way for this type of body. I refer the hon. Gentleman to clause 11(1) to (7). Under subsection (4) the Comptroller and Auditor General must
	<br><blockquote><p>"examine and certify the statement of account transmitted to him".</p></blockquote>
Under subsection (5) the Secretary of State must provide information relating to what has happened. Under subsection (6), Scottish Homes must make a report which under subsection (7) must be laid before the Houses of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I mentioned earlier, there are issues involving commercial confidentiality which mean that it would not necessarily be appropriate to open up a body such as Scottish Homes to public scrutiny when it is considering such matters. The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) touched upon that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that there are commercially sensitive matters which should not be made public through Scottish Homes. But local authorities also discuss sensitive matters, which are exempt under their regulations. It would be quite possible for commercially sensitive information to be exempt from any regulations requiring information to be made public. The Minister must concede that that is a practical way to overcome his objections.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The comparable bodies are the Scottish Development Agency and the Housing Corporation, not the local authorities. Basically, this would continue the process that they operate at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is disgraceful to compare Scottish Homes with the SDA. Surely it should be compared with housing agencies or housing authorities. The activities of housing authorities such as district councils are open to the press and the public. There has been a struggle to get new towns' activities open to the press and the public. The Minister is therefore saying that he condemns the opening up of Livingston and Glenrothes development corporation meetings in a limited way to the press.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that housing agencies should be comparable. The SSHA, the Housing Corporation and the SDA do not open up their meetings along the lines that the hon. Gentleman proposes, and nor do the new towns.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>280</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the hon. Gentleman's view. I am saying that Scottish Homes would operate on the basis on which those organisations operate at present. For the reasons that I have given, we do not consider the amendment appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is this not a golden opportunity for the Government to take on board criticisms of organisations such as the SDA and, more importantly, constructive criticism of the Housing Corporation as an undemocratic body? My experience of chairing the housing committee in Edinburgh leads me to a conclusion shared by many others—that the way in which decisions have been taken in the past about funding and resource allocation has given grounds for widespread public concern, both from previous elected council representatives such as myself and from the public in general. The establishment of a new organisation is an opportunity to take on board those criticisms by allowing if not for elections, at least for public accountability with open access to the decision-making process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister was once a councillor. He knows that there are adequate provisions within the council set-up to allow the sensitive issues on which he has touched—I feel that he is using them as an excuse—to be discussed in private if necessary. There is no problem. The Minister's argument is a red herring. Instead of taking the opportunity of this constructive amendment to bring about improvements in the existing set-up, he is trying to defend some of the worst and most criticised aspects of the quangos rather than bringing proper and positive procedures into the new structure. The Minister will regret it if he does not open up Scottish Homes to the more democratic membership and open access for which we are calling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under clause 11 it will undoubtedly be the duty of the Secretary of State to lay before each House of Parliament a copy of each report received by him under the clause. It would be subject to the scrutiny of Parliament, but for the reasons that I have given I do not believe that the amendment would be appropriate. If the hon. Member is against the way in which all the quangos in Britain are currently operated and wishes to change it, he will have to introduce a Private Member's Bill and see how he gets on with that, rather as a former Prime Minister—the present Prime Minister—brought in earlier legislation. The comparable bodies are quangos, not local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am immensely grateful to the Minister for the important news that the right hon.

His performance in the Committee should stand him in good stead as his last reply was real "Yes, Minister" stuff. Adequate scrutiny is provided for in the legislation, he says—or rather reads—because the Secretary of State for Scotland will be in charge of this quango along with the other thousand or so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

honourable man, and I am satisfied that he will apply proper financial scrutiny to the conduct of the accounts of Scottish Homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for parliamentary scrutiny, who does the Minister think he is kidding when he talks about parliamentary scrutiny of the reports of these outfits? Can we have a list of quangos nominated by the Secretary of State for Scotland and expected to submit their annual reports and accounts to Parliament? Can the Minister give one instance in the past 10 years when any change has been made in the conduct, constitution or important decisions of any of those quangos as a result of parliamentary scrutiny?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish I could. I believe that we have got to the bottom of the Minister's reason for sticking to the quango argument. It is clear that the concept has little support among the hard liners on the Government Benches, so the Minister has to dredge up arguments and rally support for the status quo. He dare not democratise it because there are plenty of Government Members who are against the concept of Scottish Homes because it will have to use some public money and to whom the notion that it should be accompanied by elections is anathema. We must sympathise with the Minister. He has to hold the line here against the hard liners in his party who do not wish to spend any public money on Scottish Homes—they do not like public money being spent on the SDA, the Housing Corporation or on the local authorities either—and who intensely dislike the idea of public scrutiny when those funds are withdrawn. By going for a quango, the Minister clearly hopes that there will be less trouble later when his hard line colleagues seek to reduce or withdraw the funding. That is presumably why he will not accept the reasoned amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths), who has invited me to speculate about the Tory thought process and why the Government favour nice closed quangos which can conduct their business behind closed doors. My hon. Friend is entitled to suggest that the Government have sinister motives. We could cite examples of other quangos getting up to various ploys at the behest of Conservative Ministers, behind closed doors or otherwise. It is a way for the Government to get their dirty work done without public scrutiny. My hon. Friend is right to address that aspect of the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>282</span>
I return to the supposed parliamentary scrutiny that the Minister suggested could take place. I do not know who he thinks he is kidding. Perhaps he will explain, stage by stage, exactly how Parliament in its wisdom could influence the decision-making of Scottish Homes. It is certainly a bizarre and roundabout way of approaching matters. It would be a sight better if Scottish Homes were required to open its doors and make its proceedings known to the public, so that tenants and others, could make suggestions about proposals being considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has set his mind against such a simple, locally-based approach. He wants everything to come down to the Mother of Parliaments and 650 Members from all over the United Kingdom. No doubt the hon. Member for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Arbuthnot) will relish the prospect of annual debates in which he will be able to exercise his vote—[HON. MEMBERS: "And speak?"]—and perhaps even speak on the affairs of Scottish Homes. We look forward to hearing from him. So far, all that he has said has been "aye" or "no"—it is getting a bit monotonous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galloway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He says "Good morning".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that a threat? Would it not make more sense to deal with these matters locally in Scotland, in front of the press, rather than relying on this rather convoluted way of scrutinising the proceedings of Scottish Homes?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have invited the Minister to take us through how this could work. I take it that Scottish Homes will be required to prepare an annual report that would be submitted to Parliament. I suppose that it would then be open to any hon. Member to table a prayer against it. What would be the standing of the report from Scottish Homes? Would it simply be one of the many glossy documents lying around the Vote Office for us to read?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Michael Ancram will be the chairman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Minister can tell us what will happen to this report. It will be circulated to Scottish Members and perhaps to other hon. Members. Will we be able to debate it? This must be the case for devolution. If Parliament is to have the duty to scrutinise the report of Scottish Homes, there must be a case for that to be dealt with by a Scottish Parliament rather than by all 650 hon. Members, including the hon. Members for Wanstead and Woodford and for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Members may not be eager to sit on Committees dealing with Scottish affairs, but we relish the prospect of such debates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is right. It would be possible to debate the annual report of Scottish Homes and other aspects of Scottish housing in the Scottish Grand Committee, but that further illustrates the scale of the problem. It does not achieve much to talk about the report of Scottish Homes, or indeed anything else, in the Scottish Grand Committee, because all that can happen is that the motion before the Committee is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"That this Committee has considered the report of Scottish Homes."</p></blockquote>
The Scottish Grand Committee in all its glory could then vote on whether it has considered the report of Scottish Homes and it would not achieve anything. Effective scrutiny cannot take place under those circumstances. It could take place only on the Floor of the House. That illustrates the absurdity of the Minister's argument that that is an appropriate and sensible way of scrutinising or publicising the decision-making process or the policies of Scottish Homes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Traditionally the Tory party has been rather hostile to the idea of quangoes, and secrecy in government and all the rest of it. Why is the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that my hon. Friend is coming to this point, but I shall pre-empt it.

Only last week, on the strength of one letter to one

headmaster in Scotland, everything fell apart. The whole framework of legislation governing Scottish education had to be altered overnight on the strength of a letter from the Prime Minister. My hon. Friend has quoted chapter and verse, the most specific instruction one could get from the highest possible authority in the land—for the Tories at any rate—saying that public bodies and quangoes should conduct their affairs in public. But here we are legislating to establish a brand new quango with wide-ranging powers affecting people's day-to-day lives, and it will be able to work behind closed doors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that Scottish Homes might voluntarily conduct its affairs in public, but hope is not good enough. It would be infinitely better if it could be made clear as part of the ground rules that under no circumstances can the aspects of its work which should properly be in the public domain be dealt with behind closed doors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept, as the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire and everybody else has accepted, that certain matters must be dealt with in private. There are ways in which local authorities can alter the rules governing their proceedings or suspend standing orders to conduct business in private. That is right and proper. But here we are talking about housing and house-letting policy and the use of vast quantities of public money which can affect the determination of housing policy, the payment of grants to the private sector, the relationship between Scottish Homes and private landlords and a range of matters which should be conducted in public, and the Minister is steadfastly resisting this modest and reasonable suggestion. My hon. Friends are less than happy with what he is saying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirk wood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make only a brief intervention, because I do not want to string out the debate. The Minister has given the Committee a very disappointing answer. I know that he is a fair-minded man. He should go back to his officials and tell them that there are categories of decisions in the process of the gestation of ideas and policies within the ranks and internal to an organisation like Scottish Homes which should be made in private, simply because they are ideas in gestation that are drawing on the various threads of policy before a conclusion is arrived at. It would be confusing if any contributory part of that process became public. If a paper was part of the picture being considered by a subcommittee, or the full committee of Scottish Homes, it would be confusing to start publishing bits and pieces. Nobody is suggesting that. It would be wrong if there was any suggestion that price-sensitive decisions should be leaked in advance. Nobody in his right mind would disagree with that and say that it should not be protected information. This body will meet four or perhaps six times a year. It will have papers presented to it, it will arrive at decisions and it will produce minutes, it must do so; it cannot proceed without producing minutes. The minutes are decisions; the decisions are the conclusion of the gestation process of drawing up the policy or the offer. I cannot for the life of me see what is wrong with making available the minutes after the meetings—even after they have been initialled by the chairman at the next quarterly meeting as a true, proper and accurate record of the previous quarterly or monthly meeting of Scottish Homes. I cannot see what it would cost Scottish Homes or anybody else to make such information available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>285</span>
In addition, there are the policy documents that were formulated by Scottish Homes. The Minister may say that they could easily be embraced in an annual report, but the annual report can be 14, 16 or 18 months out of date. The policy-making process, the decisions and directions that Scottish Homes takes in its strategic operations are documents which could be made public without cost to anybody.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would inform the whole debate about policy. Some of those people will be experts in their area, able to draw on specialists and have academic work done. They will command a range of resources and by pooling those resources will be able to formulate policy. For the life of me, I do not understand why the Minister thinks it necessary to keep such information private. He says that we must rely on the Comptroller and Auditor General's annual report. That is not what we are talking about. We are asking to know on a regular basis what the decisions of the body will be and, in the fullness of time, what the development of its policy process will be. I do not understand how the Minister can possibly resist that. If he does so, he really is in the realm of "Yes, Minister" I know that he is much too intelligent just to accept that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments may not be the right way of achieving our objective. The Minister may be right to say that a statutory process of disclosure will make life difficult for Scottish Homes. I am prepared to listen to that argument and accept it, and if he will find a new vehicle and a new formula that strikes a balance between statutorily requiring the documents that I have been talking about to be published and preserving beyond any shadow of doubt commercially sensitive information or an inadequate or incomplete policy-making process document from being published, I for one should be willing not to press the amendments. If he rests on what he has said this evening he will live to regret it, because he is a fair-minded man. He is just reading the brief that he receives from his officials. It is not good enough, and he should think about it again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had no intention of intervening in the debate because I have no practical experience of the operation of local government access provisions, although I know the legislation. But having heard the Minister and the thoroughly out-of-hand way that the points made by Opposition Members have been rebuffed, I must intervene.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We see in the Bill the usual Government—in this case, Civil Service—response to the setting up of a public body. We cannot escape from the fact that Scottish Homes will be a public body, and that must be the starting point. If we move on from there we see, in the Minister's words, the creation of "yet another quango" with limited public accountability. I do not suggest for one minute that any skulduggery is likely to happen, but at the end of the day we must consider the function of that public body. It will take over the control and running of about 100,000 public sector houses valued at I do not know how many millions of pounds; I am not sure that even the Minister could give us that figure. That quango will operate under the usual patronage system for quangos. I make no apology for criticising the Labour party for its failures in the past to tackle the problem. It is a continuing problem and an easy one for any Government to opt out of.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>286</span>
But we must consider the problem in the context in which the government have presented the Bill. There was the usual prelude of a White Paper, entitled "Housing: The Government's Proposals for Scotland". As the Minister was speaking I was flicking through that White Paper and marking one or two paragraphs that are relevant to this debate. Paragraph 1.1 states that one of the Government's main objectives of the Bill is to
	<br><blockquote><p>"encourage greater individual responsibility for, and control over, the conditions in which people live".</p></blockquote>
It is incomprehensible that people will have that greater individual responsibility for or more control over the conditions in which they live if this quango is allowed to operate in secrecy. Any tenant of Aberdeen, Edinburgh or Dundee district councils has the right to see his or her housing committee in operation. Tenants have that control and they can present a delegation to speak to the committee. Tenants of Scottish Homes will not have that ability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 1.13 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is necessary now to move forward to give tenants a greater positive role in securing the housing conditions and quality of community life to which they aspire."</p></blockquote>
How is that to be achieved if the quango is allowed to operate in the dark and if all that the tenants know about is the annual report, which is presented to Parliament and will never, because of cost, be distributed to the tenants? They will be expected to achieve that greater control in a vacuum because they will not have access to the debates and considerations of policy formation, which is crucial and in which they can take part in a local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In paragraph 1.22 the Government state: "This will enable them"—the tenants—
	<br><blockquote><p>"to improve their housing conditions and to have a say in their own future."</p></blockquote>
I make the same point: how are they to achieve that if they operate in a vacuum?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In paragraph 2.7, the Government set out their ideas on tenants' rights. I shall read the whole paragraph because it is germane to the discussion:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Scottish Homes will continue the existing role of the SSHA as a model landlord in relation to its own stock, with particular emphasis on developing greater choice for its tenants and offering them opportunities to adopt different management or ownership arrangements which will allow them to enjoy improved services, better housing conditions or greater control of their housing. It will be for tenants to exercise these choices, as and when they wish to. The Government believe that these choices will prove attractive since, as the consultation document made clear, they will reflect the wishes of tenants in each area. Tenants will not be pushed into them against their will."</p></blockquote>
How are tenants to operate in that way if the decisions are made behind closed doors, in a vacuum, remote from the tenants? How is a tenant in Orkney to know what decisions are being made in the Edinburgh headquarters of Scottish Homes? That objective will never be fulfilled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 2.8 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Tenants will continue to enjoy the same rights with Scottish Homes as their landlord as they would have possessed as tenants of the SSHA"—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>the important point follows in brackets—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"(or any other public sector landlord which may transfer some of its houses into the management of Scottish Homes)".</p></blockquote>
We face the serious possibility that when the Act becomes law district council tenants will lose rights. They will lose the right of access to the meetings of their housing committees and sub-committees because they will transfer
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0236">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>287</span>
to a body that does not allow them that right. That is inexplicable. The Government are removing rights from tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister was at pains to stress that Scottish Homes will be a quango and he equated it with the Scottish Development Agency. But in paragraph 2.21, which is headed "Conclusion", the Government specifically state about Scottish Homes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Such a body is without precedent in housing in Scotland".</p></blockquote>
That is absolutely right. Such a body is without precedent in Scotland. But we are seeing the same old formula and the same old basis on which tenants and others are being excluded from real consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government say that tenants will have exactly the same powers as they have at present—with the exception of those who will lose powers, district council tenants, because the Government will not take the opportunity to open up that process. The new landlord will own more than 100,000 houses, and will be responsible for the housing of that number of families, but meetings will be held in secret, behind closed doors. An annual report to Parliament is just not sufficient. It defeats the stated purpose—I do not say the actual purpose—of the Government in the White Paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galloway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister wish to add to that legal point before I begin?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister wishes to speak he will say so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galloway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) I had no intention of entering this debate, but so puerile and outrageous have been the noises that have been made by the Government—I will not dignify them by calling them "reasons"—against these wholly unexceptionable amendments that we must protest. One expects the Government to resist some amendments, either because they are on the payroll or because they are ideologically opposed to what is being advanced. But not only do I see no ideological objection to these amendments, I should have thought that they ran with the grain of current Conservative party thinking, especially on the Right of the party as represented by the Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth), who is the ideological guru of the Conservative party in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A principal thrust of the Government's ideology is a deep-seated hostility to quangos, statism, or corporatism. The Minister nods. That is his position, which at least is intellectually cogent. He believes in getting the state off the backs of the people. Yet here they are, quietly going about their business but still here to vote down a mild proposal which anyone interested in best practice in government could accept as the way forward. The amendment mentions the Local Government (Access to Information) Act 1985. That was a piece of Conservative party legislation, and therefore cannot be exceptionable in itself. It is clearly desirable enough for local authorities, yet we are told that its application to Scottish Homes must be resisted to the last ditch.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other Act mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for East Kilbride (Mr. Ingram) was introduced by the present Prime Minister in 1960. It is another wholly unexceptionable, indeed admirable, piece of legislation,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>288</span>
introduced by a Conservative Member of Parliament and supported by a Conservative Government. It is extraordinary, given the stated position, especially of the Right, in the Conservative party, that the Government can oppose this measure for the reasons they have given this evening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument that there will be proper parliamentary scrutiny of the activities of this gigantic body, deploying millions of pounds, is wholly bogus. When will it be? At Scottish Question Time, when the doors open, the louts stream in from all the airts and pairts—people discovering long-lost Scottish ancestry so that they can fill the Benches and catch Mr. Speaker's eye, preventing genuinely Scottish Members of Parliament from getting in their questions. Is that the sort of parliamentary scrutiny we shall be able to deploy? Or will it be such scrutiny as a Select Committee on Scottish Affairs would permit? No, because we are not to have one. Or, as the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Monro) said in a rare intervention, the Scottish Grand Committee might be able to scrutinise it. I am a new Member of Parliament, and do not know much about the Committee, because it is proving an even rarer bird than the hon. Member for Dumfries in the Committee. It is absurd to say that Scottish Homes will get the sort of scrutiny which an organisation of its size, skill, scope, breadth and capital deserves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The picture is emerging of exactly what sort of organisation Scottish Homes will be. It will be a secret organisation, whose principal role is to bring the market into housing, to provide a charter for private landlords to let the market rip. It will be controlled by nine hired men. They will probably all be men—there may be a token woman or two—but they will be hired in every sense of the word. They will be either forcibly retired Conservative Members of Parliament, or hirelings of one sort or another. They will be accountable to no one, and certainly not to the people who have the fortune or misfortune to end up as their tenants or employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One point came to my mind as the discussion proceeded, which I missed when we dealt with the matter the other day. I had planned to speak to it, but I had to leave the Committee to attend the now-famous Oxford Union debate. That was the issue of monitoring the allocation policies of organisations and individuals receiving funds from Scottish Homes. How are we to know that the nine hired guns running Scottish Homes are not all Freemasons, rolling up their trouser legs and dictating Scottish housing policy according to the latest line from the lodge? It is perfectly possible. Indeed, the Minister may be a Freemason. The Chairman of the Committee may be one—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. To defend myself, I should say that I represent masonic lodge, number nothing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galloway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was forgetting myself, Mr. Lambie. I thought that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Springburn (Mr. Martin) was still in the Chair, and he is of a different persuasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are becoming notorious throughout the world as the most secretive Government in the democratic world. We are a laughing-stock because of the extraordinary lengths and expense to which we will go to keep things secret.

6.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are prepared to push down the doors of the BBC to seize films, and to pursue tuppeny-ha'penny MI5 officers to the Antipodes, costing us hundreds of thousands of pounds, for the sake of secrecy. I do not want to over-egg the pudding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Will the hon. Gentleman relate his point to the amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galloway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we have Scottish Homes operating in the dark—whistling in the dark, too, because it will not even have a house condition survey—how long will it be before we must have a Sarah Tisdall working in Scottish Homes to post a letter to the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbaira), drawing his attention to some dark deed in the organisation, or some shortcoming in public policy? How long will it be before we have a Clive Ponting who must emerge from the shadows, only to be pursued into the courts by the same Government who are keeping these matters secret in the first place?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the Minister can say to us, like the snake Kaa in "The Jungle Book", is "Put your trust in me". Anyone whose eyes are open to the stewardship of public policy under this Government would be loth to trust them with anything, or to allow the Government to keep secret that which should be public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) said that Labour Governments have been deficient in this regard, and have set up quangos. It used to be one of the great Conservative themes, that statist, corporatist Labour was for ever setting up quangos that were impermeable, could not be held to public account and were spending public money. They had power without accountability or proper responsibility. I bear no responsibility for that. I was a strident critic of the Labour Government. If the Labour Government set up the Scottish Development Agency without making it properly accountable or allowing avenues for proper debate in the country about its affairs, that is a serious charge, of which they were probably guilty. But that can hardly be a justification for continuing bad practice in Government in this brand new flagship that will sail from over the horizon and solve Scotland's housing problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not been heavily involved in housing matters nor have I been a member of a local authority, although I am interested in the issue. It has become clear that probably on no other subject is there such a significant body of informed, expert and interested opinion in Scotland. The housing community is flooding us with information. I have so many documents that I cannot read them all. People are bombarding us with material, showing their serious interest in housing. Thousands of people work in housing; many thousands more are involved in tenants; residents' and voluntary housing associations and people generally are informed about and interested in housing. That is a final, compelling reason for the housing community in Scotland to be kept as well informed as possible about the housing policies and practices that are pursued by the most significant landlord and actor on the Scottish housing stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For all those reasons, like the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood), I appeal to the Minister to reconsider the amendments. He should ask the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth) not to resist them to the last ditch. It does him discredit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>290</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friends are right. The new agency is a public body that is not democratically elected. Most importantly, it has no satisfactory system of public accountability to those who will be directly affected by its decisions. The Minister made no case at all by referring to annual reports being placed before Parliament. Those reports deal with decisions that have already been taken and are not open to change or to influence by the general public. That is an unsatisfactory way in which to make important decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In answer to a point that I made, the Minister said that the method of accountability of Scottish Homes will be directly comparable with that of other quangos, including the Housing Corporation and the SSHA. The case for that cannot be substantiated. The Minister knows that neither the Housing Corporation nor the SSHA is directly comparable with Scottish Homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) put the point well. He said that Scottish Homes was "a body without precedent in Scotland". Those words were used in the White Paper. The housing corporation does not directly provide houses for people to live in, as Scottish Homes will; nor does the SSHA provide houses on anything like the scale of Scottish Homes. The most significant difference between those bodies and Scottish Homes is the dynamic approach which the Government intend Scottish Homes to adopt. Scottish Homes will be to housing what the SDA has been to economics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That means that Scottish Homes must develop an investment strategy and come up with a series of investment packages in alliance with the private sector to intervene in housing and make important decisions which will impact on local areas and on individuals who live there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would open up the policy-making process. The Minister has yet to address that central point: how will ordinary individuals who are likely to be affected by the investment strategy that will be pursued by Scottish Homes know what is going on during the decision-making process? How can they hope to influence it if it is not opened up and they do not have access to the papers, the minutes or reports of Scottish Homes relating to its decisions? There is no point in giving people access to those decisions once they have been taken and implemented. It is then too late. People need access during the decision-making process. The only means to that access is through the amendments, unless the Minister is prepared to reconsider the matter, consult his officials and put forward an alternative. Opposition Members would be happy if he did.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said earlier, the Committee could make more rapid progress if the usual channels on the Conservative side could bring themselves to grind into action. We are willing to make rapid and reasonable progress with the consideration of the Bill, but it seems that the Government are more interested in clocking up hours. If that is what they want, they can have it by the basinful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galloway) for raising the spectre of proceedings under the Official Secrets Act concerning the future proceedings of Scottish Homes. I suspect that there will be considerably more public interest in information that might emerge from the internal considerations of Scottish Homes than in other cases that

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>291</span>
we have heard prosecuted in recent years. Not many of my constituents are losing much sleep about whether the Zircon satellite has been constructed. But many of them will be very interested to know where money will be invested in area renewal, housing associations, in the private sector and in improvement grants for owner-occupiers and what private sector landlords will have the benefit of public money. There will be actue concern that these considerations are likely to take place behind closed doors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has told us that Scottish Homes will continue the time-honoured tradtion that quangos go their own sweet way without anyone intruding on their privacy. My hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South cited the White Paper to show that Scottish Homes will be a quango such as we have never known. Apparently, as few as nine members will have all the power and the glory—and all the budget—that goes with operation of the housing corporation as it affects Scotland at present, the functions of the SSHA and a range of functions currently carried out by local authorities in Scotland in relation to housing decisions and administration. They will also—heaven help us—have powers in relationships with the private sector and will function as though they were part of the private sector. Nine individuals, appointed by the Secretary of State for Scotland in the first instance, will have all that power to make a mass of decisions affecting all sorts of people and they will be able to conduct their proceedings behind closed doors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has adopted an absurd and indefensible position, as he and every member of the Committee knows. He can get himself off the hook quickly by acknowledging the case for the business to be conducted in public, instead of hiding behind crazy arguments about the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Secretary of State for Scotland, and, indeed, Parliament in all its glory applying adequate public scrutiny to the work of Scottish Homes. The whole Committee knows that that does not make sense. Why is the Minister not prepared to make a concession?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galloway) acknowledged that his arguments applied equally to the Labour Government, who introduced the Scottish Development Agency Bill for the SDA. [HON.

Scottish Homes will not operate in secrecy. Its role is to lay before tenants and others a choice. That will require it to publish information on which that choice can be based. The minutes of the board are unlikely to contain that type of material or to be in a form suitable for that purpose. We are following well-established precedents. Bodies such as the SSHA and the housing corporation publish full information about their activities. They publish full information for their tenants. Scottish Homes will do exactly the same. Its policies will be widely known.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Paragraph 2.21 of the White Paper states specifically:

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>292</span>
So how can it be following established patterns and procedures? This is a new body with considerable powers and considerable impact on individuals across Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>7 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is without precedent in the sense that the expertise of the SSHA and the Housing Corporation has never been combined in one body. That expertise would be combined in an extremely effective way. There are well-established precedents for bodies to follow and Scottish Homes will follow those that are comparable. As the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) said recently, Scottish Homes will do for housing very much the same as the SDA is doing to reduce unemployment and to bring about economic prosperity and opportunities. The policies of Scottish Homes will be made widely known. Statutory permission to achieve that is not required. Scottish Homes will consult tenants in the tradition of the SSHA and the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations, as the Housing Corporation does at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) asked whether the report would be circulated to Members of Parliament. Under present procedures, the reports of the Housing Corporation are circulated to Members of Parliament and I would expect that automatically to happen. Scottish Homes will follow that practice and the reports will inevitably be placed in the Library. The hon. Member for East Lothian should not underestimate the effectiveness of Back Bench Members, both in debates and in countless other matters. There are many ways in which matters can be raised if the report is in a form or publishes information about which Members are not happy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The trouble is that Scotland elected a lot of Members of Parliament at the last election and asked them to influence policy in relation to housing in Scotland, but one need look no further than at the composition of this Committee to see how ineffective the democratic process is at present. Scotland has 62 Members of Parliament who are opposed to most of the thrust of this legislation and only 10 who support it, but what good is that? We still have this rubbish rammed down our throats by the Minister and his colleagues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman goes a little too far. On Second Reading, the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) said that he did not object to the concept of putting together the SSHA and the Housing Corporation. The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) very fairly said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is some sense in a unified housing agency."</p></blockquote>
Even the hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh) said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government's stated White Paper objectives were reasonable and deserved support. It is a worthwhile objective to give people a wider choice in housing, to improve the supply and quality of that housing, to encourage greater individual responsibility for, and control over, the conditions in which people live".—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 11 January 1988; Vol. 125, c. 76–90.]</p></blockquote>
Debates can take place in a number of ways—Supply days, Estimates, Adjournment debates—and through direct approaches. On a constituency basis when I was a Back Bench Member of Parliament I invited the chairman of the SDA to Pilton in my constituency to ask him to do something, and at the very least I got an adventure playground out of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The board of directors will meet in secret. No member of the public will have access to those meetings to learn what is being talked about. The board of directors will decide what is to be published, and no one will have any means of questioning that. The Minister must deal with the problem of getting access to those secret meetings so that people can know what is being discussed, what the options are and what is being dismissed or agreed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said earlier, there will be certain issues subject to commercial confidence. [HON. MEMBERS: "We have accepted that."] We are following the established precedent of the SDA and the legislation introduced by the Labour Government not so many years ago. Under the proposals in the Bill Scottish Homes will be fully accountable. The provisions of the Bill are adequate to achieve that purpose. Nothing would be gained by applying to Scottish Homes the provisions of an Act designed primarily for local authorities and connected bodies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very surprised that a relatively innocuous amendment that would subject Scottish Homes to the provisions of the Local Government (Access to Information) Act is not acceptable to the Government. Undoubtedly double standards are being applied here. I repeat that part of the double standards being applied are to protect the Minister's and indeed the Secretary of State's friends and appointees to the board of Scottish Homes. At present there is widespread criticism of Government appointments to the quangos. I do not apologise for repeating that Lothian health board has been shamefully treated in terms of Government appointees. I understand that it will announce today the closure of 10 hospitals locally. We shall bring the Minister to the House as soon as possible to answer for those.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is no coincidence that under the Government the composition of the health board membership has changed. The public once had confidence in all members of the health board, but that no longer applies. There was all-party support, despite party differences, in the membership of Lothian health board as recently as 10 years ago, but that has been completely eroded by the Government. Time after time they have replaced solid citizens, having a wealth of experience in health board matters, with people who have little experience in such matters but much experience in membership of the Conservative party or in the accountancy professions. The health board in Lothian, and appointments to it, are treated like a franchise or cost-cutting accountancy operation, rather than as a body caring for people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We fear that the same thing will happen with Scottish Homes. That is why it is important that we establish the right of people to receive information. It is shocking that as we move towards the 1990s, at a time when councils are increasingly opening decision-making to tenants, Scottish Homes is not going as far as councils have, almost since their inception, which is to allow tenants the right of direct representation, to see minutes and to examine the books. The public are not allowed to do that. Tenants are not allowed to do that. The press will not be allowed to do that. Despite what the Minister says, I suspect that Parliament will not be allowed to do that. I shall be very
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>294</span>
surprised if Members of Parliament are given the minutes of Scottish Homes. The Minister may wish to say whether Members of Parliament will be given the minutes and detailed information if they request it. I am sure that the answer will be no.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may enjoy using the play equipment installed in his constituency, but it is not much of a tribute to the way in which the SDA operates that it takes a Member of Parliament to bring in an agency such as the SDA to order play equipment as though from a shopping list, and the local people who use it—I take it that the Minister does not use it—are not allowed to make direct representations to the SDA. At present a key provision in the SDA's ability to supply such equipment is that it generally goes through local authorities, and their decisions to invite the SDA in, usually in a partnership agreement, are subject to the provisions of the Local Government (Access to Information) Act 1985, to which Scottish Homes will not be subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, we have the spectre of two quangos, neither of which is seen as representative by the people, getting together and deciding on play equipment, houses and, more seriously, matters affecting people's lives. That there should be no access to such information is quite wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is good enough for local government, which I believe sets some of the highest standards in provision, should also be good enough for Scottish Homes. By not accepting the amendment, the Government are looking backwards, taking their siege mentality to extremes and showing that they are as unwilling to open up the books, organisation, minutes and operations of Scottish Homes to public scrutiny as they are to allow themselves to be scrutinised by the public. We want to get rid of that siege mentality, which is all too prevalent in Government circles, and the best way to do that is to use the 1985 Act so that people's rights to information can be firmly established. The Government will deny that right to information, if they do not accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like other Opposition Members I am becoming more and more concerned and frustrated, because our fairly detailed points and the detailed questions that we put to the Minister are simply brushed aside. We are given generalisations from the Minister's brief and we find that all the Opposition's pertinent and cogent points are thoroughly ignored. I know that that is not the normal way of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton), who is an open man and attempts to bring an objective mind to matters. I suspect that he is being whipped into being as obtuse as possible to give the Opposition as little as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is another example of the English tail wagging the Scottish dog. The Committee is not being given the information to which it is entitled to examine the Bill properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat a specific point among the many which the Minister has failed to answer: what does he have to say to me and to present local authority tenants who will or may transfer to Scottish Homes who will lose an existing right? New horizons will not be opened to them, as the White Paper suggests: they will lose their existing right as local authority tenants to contribute to or be present at the making of decisions which affect their accommodation. The Minister must answer that important point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall make one more brief attempt to persuade the Minister to answer the Opposition's points, which he has so far failed to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister tried to argue that to open the meetings of Scottish Homes was wrong because it would involve making public commercially sensitive information. He knows, as all the members of the Committee know, that that is an entirely bogus answer. He knows that measures exist which can make such commercially sensitive information exempt from publication. At present if information is regarded as too sensitive to be issued to the public, local authorities can hold it back. Such a facility could be made available to Scottish Homes in the case of commercially sensitive information. It is bogus of the Minister to argue that meetings cannot be opened on those grounds. He is thrown back on harping on about precedents, in particular those of the Housing Corporation and the SSHA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister ignores the precedent of the district councils. My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths) raised that point pertinently, and the Minister must answer it. It will be possible for Scottish Homes to take under its control houses which are currently under the control of district councils. The tenants in those houses have a right under the Local Government (Access to Information) Act 1985 to council papers, minutes and recorded decisions about their tenancies and homes. That right will now be withdrawn and they will not have a similar right if Scottish Homes becomes the new landlord. The Minister must address that central point. His failure to do so leads me to the conclusion that his reluctance to concede the amendments or make alternative arrangements which may be suggested to him by his civil servants is caused by the Government's long-term aim to privatise Scottish Homes. Otherwise his opposition to the amendments makes no sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The conclusion must be that the Government are determined in the long term to hand over Scottish Homes to the private sector lock, stock and barrel. They are reluctant to impose on it any statutory responsibility to open its meetings to public scrutiny, because they would be saddling the future privately owned Scottish Homes with the same responsibility, and they are not prepared to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Hillhead said that the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth) was anxious to get the state off people's backs. He is anxious to do that only to make room for private monopolies to jump on. That is the real root of the Minister's opposition to the amendments and the real reason why he is refusing to give way on the Opposition's legitimate and reasonable request that these meetings be opened to public scrutiny because they affect individuals and the public, who have a right to know.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Scottish Homes will be a public sector body. In response to the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran), I make it clear that tenants who exercise the right to transfer to Scottish Homes will do so in full knowledge of the facts and conditions applying to the new tenancy. Local authority tenants would have the fullest information put before them. That will be an extremely important part of Scottish Homes' role in tenants' choice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that was meant to be a reply to the debate, it was not very clever. I invite the Minister to say a little more about his interesting and relevant analogy with his representations as a Member of Parliament to the Scottish Development Agency. If that is to be the future pattern for influencing investment decisions by the Scottish Homes, it causes some alarm. Over the years, local authorities have been required to open their proceedings to the public, and there has been a determined effort to stop the bad old habit of local authorities saying, "Have a word with Councillor So-and-so who will be able to get a house for you", or "who will be able to transfer you into a house in a better area because he knows the right people". The thrust of policy-making in recent years has been to get away from such hole-in-the-wall, ad hoc decision-making and to lay down priorities and policies to enable every citizen to be dealt with on an equal basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting point. If individual Members of Parliament will be able to approach Scottish Homes for special favours for their constituencies, is my hon. Friend alarmed by the suggestion that the chairman of the new Scottish Homes board may be Mr. Michael Ancram, who will be more likely to do favours for Conservative Members than for Labour Members?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Leaving aside the individual nightmares that my hon. Friend might have in mind, there is a point of principle here. We need to know the style of operation of that body, and this is the right debate to try to winkle it out. What the Under-Secretary of State has just said is very revealing. He said earlier that Scottish Homes would be a national quango, accountable to the Secretary of State and, through him, to Parliament. It would be financially accountable to the Comptroller and Auditor General; and because it was accountable to Parliament, minutes would be circulated to individual Members of Parliament—presumably every single Member of Parliament, including the hon. Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Adams)—and Members of Parliament could influence the decisions of Scottish Homes. The Under-Secretary of State talked about his playground and described how he had invited the chairman of the Sciottish Development Agency to come to his constituency, they had looked at something and decided that that playground should be built. I am very happy for the constituents of the hon. Gentleman that that playground was built.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is now in the constituency of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Leith (Mr. Brown).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, I am even happier. The point that the Minister was acknowledging, whether he meant to or not, was that the job got done because of direct lobbying by the local Member of Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will finish this dialogue with the Minister before giving way. Is it the most appropriate way of determining decisions that will be made by such a body? Will investment decisions, on the targeting of money for development of neighbourhoods hang on the influence of individual Members of Parliament within Scottish Homes? That brings us to the question of who will nominate Scottish Homes. What sort of people will be on the Scottish Homes board?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise, Mr. Lambie, for moving away from the question whether discussions should be conducted in public, but the discussions will be about, among other things, the targeting of investment programmes. If those private discussions can be influenced by direct representation made by Members of Parliament, especially given the present circumstances in Scotland, that is rather disturbing. If the Secretary of State nominates this quango, we can visualise the sort of people that those nine individuals are likely to be. We could almost name them. I doubt whether they will be the sort of people who one would normally regard as representative of public opinion in Scotland. We have seen some interesting speculation about possible candidates for the chairmanship of Scottish Homes, and I can imagine the accountants and directors of large corporations that may or may not give regular donations to the Conservative party who are likely to be members of the board of Scottish Homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to his efforts and to the fact that the area concerned was subsequently transferred to Leith constituency. I speculate on what influence the Minister, or one of his hon. Friends, would have if they said, "I have this pet project in my constituency. Under section 1(3) 	<i>(f)</i> of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1988 I think it would be a great idea if Scottish Homes would get involved in a major area renewal project and spend a whole lot of money, not only on upgrading the housing but on providing new community facilities, play parks, an industrial development, and all the rest of it."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Leith (Mr. Brown) or any other Opposition Member went along to try to influence the chairman of Scottish Homes over a gin and tonic, or whatever they do in the future to get the work done, how much influence would they have?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am, Mr. Lambie. The hon. Gentleman is being particularly unfair to colleagues on both sides of the House. I took a problem to the late Frank McElhone, the hon. Member for Glasgow, Gorbals, when he was a Minister. It concerned the rebuilding of a school in a part of my constituency that is no longer part of my constituency, and he acceded to my request. On the basis of what the hon. Gentleman is saying, it might appear that because we were comrades on opposite sides of the House who happened to have previous experiences and affections for each other—I had done him favours in other ways—that was a matter of partiality. It is betraying the integrity of the House to suggest that hon. Members of any party behave in that way. People will listen to one's case, and if it is presented with honesty, integrity and affection, it will receive a proper answer and not a prejudiced rebut or recall.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman has made a fair point, but we are not talking about a Minister or another hon. Member of the House. We are talking about members of a quango who will have been appointed under the patronage of the Secretary of State for Scotland and who could be subject to such influence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I realise that it is terrible for the hon. and learned Gentleman to put up with, but if he wants to comment on one of my speeches, perhaps he would listen specifically to what I have been saying. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, West drew the analogy with representations which he personally had made in the past to the chairman of the Scottish Development Agency, and how that had led to the construction of a playground in what later turned out to be the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Leith (Mr. Brown). I was suggesting that the hon. Member had let the cat out of the bag by showing that influence could be brought to bear on the chairman or members of the quango concerned, rather than on a Minister. I said that that might not have been the most appropriate way of conducting our affairs, and that it would have been better if all those decisions were determined according to policies agreed by the members of Scottish Homes in public meetings, so that if members of the public, tenants, householders or anybody else wanted to influence the decisions of that quango or its agenda, they could make their own representations.

I was saying that, just like the Highlands and Islands Development Board, it was set up by a Labour Government. That does not meet in public either.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon.

We acknowledge that mistakes may have been made in the past, and we want to try to move forward. This Bill is an opportunity to take it forward.

I understand from the way in which the hon. Member for Tayside, North is approaching the subject that he may sympathise with the case made by all Opposition members of the Committee. I suspect that if we went through 	<i>Hansard</i> over the years, we should find examples of the hon.

He is having an intimidatory effect on his neighbour. We have been round this course a few times already.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments were tabled not for opposition for opposition's sake. The Opposition started out with a reasonable approach on the time in which we would discuss the set of amendments. The Minister's answers—what he would term answers, but which are non-answers in our view—has provoked a longer debate, which perhaps was necessary on the clause. There is a genuine belief among the Opposition, as can be heard from the contributions of my hon. Friends, that we need to open the doors of public bodies to public scrutiny. That is our warmly felt belief. As a councillor in East Kilbride, I argued that we should consult the public, including non-domestic ratepayers, before that legislation came into play. It was important to discuss with and explain to the people paying for the services exactly what the authority was
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>300</span>
doing. These are reasonable amendments and there is a genuine belief in their basis. The Minister's answers add up to "Trust us".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galloway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend should not call them "answers". I tried to count the words of the Minister's last answer. I concede that there were too many to count in the staccato way in which he delivered them, but there could not have been more than 15 words in his answer to contributions made by just about every member of the Committee over a considerable period of time. It may be naivety on my part, but I have never sat on a Committee like this. The Minister's performance is an insult to the House of Commons. I said several times that the Minister was the nice guy, but, frankly I am beginning to doubt it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister called them answers. The Opposition regard them as non-answers. If they can be summed up in any way, the Government are simply saying, "Trust us." Why should 83,000 future tenants of Scottish Homes trust the Government? They are a double-dealing Government for the people of Scotland and there is no respect whatever for their actions among the body politic or the electorate of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Lambie. Are we to take it that brevity is in some way contrary to content?

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And the hon. and learned Member knows that that is not a point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that we can dispose of that. I hope that I am being brief. I was brief in my opening comments, and I hope to be brief in what may be my closing comments. It is important that we get to the nub of the argument. I said that it was a straightforward amendment, striking at the heart of the question of accountability of public bodies. The Opposition genuinely believe in that philosophy. I hope that the Minister would agree to consider the amendment in the light of experience in the new towns and the Secretary of State encouraging new town corporations to adopt his approach towards public accountability, opening up their proceedings and making press statements on what goes on on corporation boards. Apparently, we are not to get even that with Scottish Homes. The 1985 Act and the 1960 Act have been cast aside. We are told that they do not apply to development corporation boards, but that is no answer. We are talking about a housing agency. At least 83,000 and perhaps eventually 100,000 or more tenants will be conditioned by the activities of Scottish Homes. The Minister says that those people who pay the rent, and who are ratepayers and taxpayers, are to have no access whatever to the minutes, records and activities of Scottish Homes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With his recent experience as a member of a local authority in Scotland, can my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is our question to the Minister. Local authority representatives in Labour-controlled authorities all over Scotland are opening up their books and their activities to the public. They are saying to the public, "We want to talk to you more and more about our activities". That is a lesson that all of us in politics have learnt over the past few decades, or perhaps just the past decade. There is a need for that openness, but the Government are becoming more and more secretive at a time when the opposite is happening in local government. If local authorities had not opened up their books, the Government would have imposed even severer conditions on them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galloway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the point that I was trying to get across earlier. That is why the hon. Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd), who is on the Right of the Conservative party and made such a powerful speech in the House about the need to reform the Official Secrets Act, obtained the positive support of some, and the abstention of other, Right-wing, libertarian Conservative Members of Parliament—the kind of people who I see from 	<i>The Scotsman,</i> somewhat to my surprise, used to kneel at the feet of the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart). I did not know that he was a lecturer on political economy at St. Andrew's and still less that he was a guru to some of those Conservative Members. My comments are directed to the two extreme Right-wing Conservative Members in the Committee—the Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth), and the hon. Member for Eastwood. Mr. Shepherd is a fellow-traveller of theirs. Others, such as Marlow—[HON. MEMBERS: "Oh!"] I am sorry, I do not know the constituency. Many extreme Right-wing Conservative Members voted with the hon. Member for Aldridge-Brownhills on that issue. The Right has discovered secrecy and states in one forum that secrecy should be opposed. There is a contradiction between that and the stance taken by Conservative Members in the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is typical of this place that Conservative Members become agitated because a Labour Member cannot remember a Conservative Member's constituency. We come to this place to break conventions, because that is how laws are changed. The conventions of the House are unimportant—[HON. MEMBERS: "Oh!"]—by comparison with the rights of 83,000 future tenants of Scottish Homes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to the fact that we are discussing amendment No. 106. We must all obey the Standing Orders and the rules of the House. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to make speeches about that, I hope that he will make them in another place. The Committee is dealing with amendment No. 106.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So long as the other place is not the House of Lords, as we hope that that will be abolished.

The Opposition genuinely believe in public scrutiny and public accountability. We have been reasonable in our arguments. We have given the Minister a range of propositions, quoting from the White Paper and giving examples from legislation. We cannot be any more reasonable about the amendments than we have been. We have not been hectoring </div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hector is not here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was not a breach of convention. We have not been arguing for the sake of arguing. We have
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>302</span>
kept tightly to our view that we expect to see these rights applied to the 83,000 tenants of Scottish Homes. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I do not understand how Conservative Members can find this subject funny, unless it is because of their contempt for the Scottish people.

I ask hon. Members with integrity to vote for the amendments, because in so doing they will be defending the rights of those who will be subjected to the will of the board of Scottish Homes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
