TENANCIES WHICH CANNOT BE ASSURED TENANCIES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 98, in page 51, line 39, at end insert
<br><blockquote><p>'but which part shall not in any case exceed 60% of the sums so payable unless the tenancy agreement explicitly provides for a proportion which is greater or lesser than 60%.'.</p></blockquote>
We come now to schedule 4 which lists tenancies which cannot be assured tenancies. Amendment No. 98 relates to paragraph 2 which excludes tenancies at low rent but accepts that there are circumstances in which, although there is low rent, other payments may be due by the tenant for services, maintenance, repairs, insurance or other such matters as listed in the Bill. The amendment seeks to clarify the position where there is doubt about amounts that are rent and those that are not. It tries to lay down statutory provision for guidance purposes.<br><br>
The amendment would also prevent landlords from pleading that within a substantial overall payment there was only a low rent element. We wish to identify clearly the elements relating to non-rent items. It is an attempt to provide protection for tenants who might have unscrupulous landlords.<br><br>
The figure of 60 per cent. is an attempt at a reasonable amount. If the Minister accepts the amendment, he will do so on the basis that we may wish to alter the figure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that the hon. Member for East Kilbride (Mr. Ingram) has tabled this interesting amendment, which gives me a chance to explain our proposal to exempt low rent tenancies from the assured arrangements.<br><br>
Low rent tenancies are excluded from the provisions of the Rent (Scotland) Act 1987. In that Act, a low rent tenancy is defined in relation to the rateable value of the property at a certain date. As domestic rates will cease in Scotland on 1 April 1989, that approach will not do for the new legislation. Therefore, we propose to take the power for my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State to set by order a rent level below which a tenancy will not be an assured tenancy. I assure the hon.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 552</span>
Gentleman that we intend to set the rent level sufficiently low that only tenancies that are clearly left at well below market rents will be exempted.<br><br>
Obviously it is necessary, in deciding whether a rent qualifies as low, to leave out of account any payment made by the tenant for a service, a repair, maintenance, or insurance. Often when a house is let on a peppercorn rent the tenant will be happy to pay the appropriate cost of such services. The amendment seems designed to prevent landlords from cheating by claiming that part of the rent is for services, and thus that the tenancy qualifies as a low-rent tenancy which should be exempted from the assured tenancy provisions.<br><br>
The amendment is unnecessary because there are two safeguards already in the provision. First, it is our intention to set the limit so that only tenancies with very low rents are exempt. If a landlord tried to obtain an income equivalent to a market rent while setting the amount of rent low enough to qualify, the purported service charge would need to be so high that it would be clear that the landlord was cheating.<br><br>
Secondly, the provision in paragraph 2 of schedule 4 already states that service charges are to be disregarded unless they could not have been regarded by the parties as service charges. Those two safeguards seem adequately to protect against the type of abuse about which hon. Members have expressed concern. The amendment is unnecessary, and could even have the undesirable effect of bringing into the assured tenancy regime tenancies for which almost no rent is payable but the tenant pays a fair and reasonable charge for some services.<br><br>
In view of what I have said, I hope that the Hon. Member for East Lothian will withdraw his amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that the Minister has confirmed the low level at which rent will be fixed. However, I am worried about the possibility of an order laid by the Secretary of State applying a market rent that might apply in central Edinburgh but not necessarily in, say, Dundee or rural areas. Will there be a geographical bias or will there be simply an average or an assessment of what a market rent should be because there will be considerable regional differences?<br><br>
Landlords have been seen to attempt to drive a coach and horses through existing legislation. One device was the provision of services and creation of artificial prices. I am not as sanguine as the Minister about the safeguards. This is a serious problem and attempts will be made to limit the effectiveness of even these diluted provisions.<br><br>
Paragraph 2(2) refers in part to
<br><blockquote><p>"such part (if any) of the sums payable by the tenant as is or was expressed (in whatever terms)".</p></blockquote>
The difficulties here highlight the need for a written lease. The Minister has given an undertaking to consider this point. In such difficult areas, a written lease is absolutely crucial.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, the type of houses that we are considering are those for which the rent is often quite low for charitable or benevolent purposes—it might be a Church of Scotland house or something of that nature.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked what is a market rent? It varies from area to area depending on the prevailing circumstances. The hon. Gentleman will know that after the drop in oil prices the market rent in Aberdeen went down, I imagine. It varies from month to month from area
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0383">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 553</span>
to area, but this would be very much lower. The only rough and ready assessment that I can give is that if, for example, someone was paying £1,500 or more for services, it would be clear that he was paying a disguised rent. That is the reason for the provision. I believe that it contains the safeguards that hon. Members would wish.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) identified one of the main points. The Government are less than certain that the safeguards will be adequate. I am less than certain how that disguised rent is to be evaluated. The Minister gave us his assessment, but it does not seem to be clearly defined. The amendment seeks to clarify the position. I accepted that a 60 per cent. mix was only a cockshy attempt to find out what would be reasonable. The amendment sought at least to lay down a standard, whereas the Minister simply gave us his view on how the safeguard was to be written in and how it was to be controlled and regulated. However, if the Minister will respond, we shall consider withdrawing the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Paragraph 2(3) says: "An order under sub-paragraph (1) above may specify different rents in relation to—
<br><blockquote><p>(a) different kinds of houses;</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(b) different areas."</p></blockquote>
There are two safeguards. First, the Secretary of State specifies the rents by order. Secondly, paragraph 2(2) states that service charges are to be disregarded, unless they could not have been regarded as service charges. There is a considerable amount of case law in Scotland relating to the matter and it depends on all the facts and circumstances of a case. We consider that those two safeguards should meet the points that the hon. Gentleman made.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, we have doubts about the way that that will work in practice, but having heard what the Minister said, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 133, in page 52, line 29, after first 'the' insert 'bona fide'.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 134, in page 52, line 30, at end insert 'for less than three months'.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These amendments were suggested by Shelter and deal with the need to prevent false holiday lets by landlords. They seek to probe the Government's attitude to the problem of landlords unscrupulously using holiday provisions to circumvent even the newly reduced provisions of security of tenure and the protection available to tenants under the new assured tenancy provisions.<br><br>
Shelter has studied rent Act evasions, especially those taking place in Glasgow. Its work revealed problems in relation to holiday lets. If accommodation is let for the purpose of a holiday, it would be unreasonable for a tenant to expect security of tenure beyond the agreed period, or to expect to have a fair rent set. However, many landlords describe as holiday flats premises that are obviously not intended for the purpose of a holiday, by virtue of the circumstances that Shelter discovered. They include, for example, the fact that a landlord knows that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 554</span>
a tenant is employed in the area. Shelter is also worried about cases where the duration of a tenancy is much longer than can by any stretch of the imagination be considered a genuine, bona fide holiday. Shelter also discovered instances where the location of a property could hardly be defined as a holiday resort.<br><br>
Amendment No. 133 seeks to insert the words "bona fide" before the word "purposes" in paragraph 8, and is a simple attempt to try to have the purpose examined by the court. It would enable the courts to go behind the intention and allow considerations such as the employment of the tenant and the duration of the tenancy to be examined.<br><br>
9.15 pm<br><br>
The amendment would also allow the courts to turn a
sham holiday let into an assured tenancy where it was the clear intention of the landlord to use paragraph 9 to avoid giving an assured tenancy—for example, where a holiday let was continually renewed by the well-known Scots doctrine of tacit relocation—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What does it mean?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can explain the meaning of tacit relocation if I am pressed—or by a new contract with the existing tenant. The court could make a judgment on the facts of individual cases that the bona fide purpose of the letting was not to confer on the tenant the right to occupy the house for a holiday.<br><br>
There would remain an incentive for a landlord to avoid granting an assured tenancy under the Bill as he or she could then avoid the minimum letting period under short assured tenancies, avoid intervention of the rent assessment committee and in addition avoid having to state one of the 17 grounds for eviction for a full assured tenancy. In those circumstances, the tenant would not have even the limited protection given by the Bill to assured tenants.<br><br>
The purpose of amendment No. 134 is to limit the length of occupancy of tenancy that describes itself as a holiday let. I understand the difficulties. As a result of the amendment, a longer tenancy would automatically fail to be deemed a holiday let and would therefore become an assured tenancy. At present, the courts normally accept a letting of far less than three months which is described in the lease as a holiday let if it is a genuine holiday let. However, the absence of a legal definition of a holiday let has created significant problems for tenants and allowed landlords to avoid their responsibility in the past. For example, in Shelter's view, the welcome closing of the board and attendance loophole in assured tenancies will make holiday lets the main focus for evading giving protection to tenants.<br><br>
It can be argued that genuine holiday lets could be far longer than three months and that the amendment would give holiday tenants significant new rights. However, the definition in clause 12(1)(b), which stipulates that an assured tenancy must be occupied by the tenant or by at least one of the tenants
<br><blockquote><p>"as his only or principal home"</p></blockquote>
would prevent the granting of assured tenancies where the tenant had other accommodation as his principal home. My submission and that of Shelter is that if paragraph 9 of schedule 4 is not tightened, unscrupulous landlords will quickly discover that using the paragraph can leave a tenant with no security or rights and paying excessive and unreasonable rents.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 555</span>
The Committee should spend a moment or so considering the issue. These two probing amendments are the best way that I and Shelter could devise of initiating a debate, and I look forward to the Government's response.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn) asked the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) to define the term "tacit relocation." We have an example of it in Committee in the hon. Member for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Arbuthnot). We would rather he was not here, but provided that he keeps quiet we are prepared to thole him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should be obliged if the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) would tell us what he understands by the term "tacit relocation" in the law of Scotland, of which he is so fond, how it affects tenancies for holidays, tenancies of under 12 months and tenancies of longer duration.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have no idea how it affects tenancies for holidays or whatever.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What does it mean then?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: So far as I know, it applies where a tenancy has come to its logical conclusion but is allowed to carry on by mutual consent. That has always been my understanding as a mere farmer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is used mainly in farming.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes; many farms are on tacit relocation.<br><br>
I have mixed feelings about the amendment and about attempts to add to the provisions of the schudule. The schedule excludes certain categories of tenancies from the possibility of being regarded as assured tenancies. From our debates so far I am inclined to think that assured tenancies are a bad thing, so any exclusion from being an assured tenancy is likely to be useful in many cases. However, I take the point of the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) in this category, because we are talking about people who will be even worse off than they would be under assured tenancies.<br><br>
Some people live in what are nominally holiday lets. Around the coast in East Lothian in my constituency are holiday cottages and caravans which, outside the holiday season, are let to people who would otherwise be homeless. When the holiday season comes round again and the landlord has scope for getting more money out of holidaymakers, those people are flung out and have no security. I do not suggest that the provision would necessarily help them, but the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire is right. We are talking about a category of people who are entitled to slightly more protection than they have now. The assured tenancy may be better than nothing and seems a useful area to explore.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Although I support the amendment, it is interesting to note that the wording has been adapted from and is almost the same as that in the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984.<br><br>
The principle involved is worth putting on the record. The existing rights of public and private tenants in Scotland are being shaken loose a wee bit and diluted. The Government have an opportunity to bring some regularity
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 556</span>
to the market and to close what we may regard as loopholes. The other side of expanding the market, moving in favour of landlords and bringing more houses on to the private rented market, is the opportunity for the Government to close existing loopholes.<br><br>
We have heard from the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) about the experience of Shelter, which is an expert in the subject with more experience than most. Shelter says that holiday lets are a common means whereby landlords evade their responsibilities.<br><br>
The amendments are fairly simple. I might quibble with the three months suggestion because a time limit could create problems. I do not know many folk who can afford to take a three-month holiday, but that is something else.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Members of Parliament can.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is considerable scope for introducing a simple amendment such as the bona fide condition, which would give the courts something to get their teeth into. It would allow them to investigate and look behind the contractual relations and circumstances to ascertain whether there was a true tenancy. The possibility is worth considering and is the downside of this problem.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) raised the issue of tacit relocating—he is a lawyer, like the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) and my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn)—but he did not say what it means. My understanding of tacit relocation is that when a lease comes to an end, if neither party takes any action such as serving a notice to quit or negotiating a new lease, the silence implies that the parties are content to let the lease run on its existing conditions. If the lease is for a year or more, it is renewed for a year; if it is for less, it runs on its original terms for that period. Basically, the situation is the same as before.<br><br>
On the absence of a definition of a holiday let, I suspect that none is needed in this respect. If it came to the test, a court—like rent officers—would take the common-sense view of what a reasonable man would describe as a holiday let, taking into account all the circumstances.<br><br>
The two amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire arise from a reasonable concern to prevent potential abuse. The Government are as concerned as Opposition Members to avoid abuse under the new arrangements, and I shall be happy to consider carefully any suggestions that are made to achieve that.<br><br>
We all agree, I am sure, that when a person lets his house honestly for a holiday, that let should not be subject to the various provisions of the Bill. It is common ground, similarly, that only legitimate holiday lets should be exempted. I am convinced that the existing drafting achieves that end.<br><br>
Hon. Members may be aware of cases in England where, under existing legislation, landlords have sought to evade the Rent Act provisions by pretending to be letting for a holiday when the let is, in fact, for residential purposes. A few similar cases have come to our notice through the rent registration system in Scotland, and I understand that the rent officers have taken a robust attitude if there has been any doubt about the landlord's
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0385">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 557</span>
intention. I understand that rent officers' decisions in those cases have not been challenged. I think that the fears of Opposition Members are largely groundless.<br><br>
The addition of "bona fide", as proposed by amendment No. 133, would not in practice have the slightest effect. In assessing whether a tenancy is a holiday let, the sheriff would need to be convinced of the landlord's true intention in any case.<br><br>
The limitation to three months on the length of a let that will qualify as a holiday let, as proposed by amendment No. 134, is different. It does not take too much imagination to think of legitimate holiday lets for more than three months. I have in mind a retiring headmaster in Canada or Australia who wished to visit relatives in Scotland and stay for longer than three months before returning home. It seems equally possible for attempted abuse of the provision to relate to tenancies which purport to be for far less than three months. The length of time chosen by the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire is arbitrary.<br><br>
In short, while I wholeheartedly agree with the wish to avoid abuse of the system, I feel that the two amendments are unnecessary, ineffective and potentially unfair. Moreover, the existing wording imparts adequate safeguards. I hope, therefore, that there will be a preparedness to withdraw the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not entirely happy with the Minister's reply. He says that the existing drafting satisfies the need to prevent potential abuse, and that our concern is unnecessary. But he overlooks the Shelter report which was mentioned by my hon. Friends and which gave examples of abuses of the existing statutory rights of tenants. The report showed that landlords were using the holiday let provisions in the 1984 legislation, which I understand are the same as in the Bill, to get round the existing statutory rights of tenants in terms of fair rents and security of tenure. Sham holiday lets were being arranged with people who were employed in the area, and for longer periods than normal holiday lets would cover. Sham holiday lets were arranged in areas which could never, by any stretch of the imagination, be described as holiday areas. People would be unlikely to spend holidays in Easterhouse, but it would be possible to get a sham holiday let there under the existing drafting. The position in Dundee is more serious because it is a holiday resort, with Broughty ferry and sandy beaches. In fact, thousands of people come from the west coast every year, and it would be easy to arrange sham holiday lets for people who live and work in the area. Indeed, it is probably happening now, and the Minister seems quite happy to allow it to go on happening. Low assured tenancies would certainly weaken existing tenant rights, and by failing to beef up the clause the Minister seems to be saying that even their rights under assured tenancies will be removed by unscrupulous landlords who will be able to take away any of the rights of their tenants by using this holiday let cop-out.<br><br>
9.30 pm<br><br>
It is no use the Minister saying that tenants will have to enter into agreements voluntarily. He knows very well that those who are desperate for somewhere to live are in no position to bargain with landlords. If they are desperate enough, they will accept almost anything.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 558</span>
How would it harm the Minister if he agreed to tighten the holiday let provision by adding "bona fide" and including three months? to illustrate the way in which a person could be disadvantaged, the Minister gave the example of someone's uncle who had come here from Canada and who wished to stay longer than the three months that he originally intended. But there is no way in which that person would take his uncle to court, or the uncle take him to court. We are worried about people who are abusing the system because of the loophole which the Minister could easily close, but his answer is, "No. I am prepared to let it continue. I am prepared to allow tenants to continue to be exploited."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With respect, that is not true. Under the present wording, the tenant would be able to take the landlord to court, with the help of advice from organisations such as citizens advice bureaux and Shelter.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Aberdeen, South suggested, as did the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion), that holiday lets are a common means of evasion. When such evasion is successful, it is because the tenant has not challenged the landlord. If it is a bogus or sham holiday let, it is almost certain that any court would so rule. It is possible that tenants are not aware of their rights.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There should be written leases so that they know their rights.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agreed earlier to look into the matter, and I shall come back to it in due course.<br><br>
I agree with the sentiments that underlie the amendments. Abuse of holiday lets is clearly unacceptable, but the amendments are unnecessary. Amendment No. 133 would add no real protection for tenants, and amendment No. 134 might unfairly penalise landlords who were letting legitimately for holiday purposes while failing to outlaw some potential abuses. Therefore, I hope that the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire will withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This takes me into unchartered territory. Paragraph 9 of the schedule, which deals with resident landlords, sets out exemptions to the assured tenancy provisions, and our aim in amendment No. 138 is to bring resident landlords within the scope of the assured tenancy provisions and thus protect their tenants.<br><br>
I have received representations from Shelter, telling me how serious the problem is, especially in urban areas where
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0386">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 559</span>
houses are in multiple occupation. Both the amendments are important and I crave the Committee's indulgence because I shall need to bury myself in the technical details of Shelter's representations.<br><br>
At present, tenants of resident landlords do not enjoy full rent Act protection. Such protection as they have is afforded by Part VII of the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984, which gives them the right not to be evicted without a court order, the right not to be harassed and the right to have a reasonable rent assessed by a rent assessment committee. When a resident landlord seeks an order for repossession, that must be granted, subject to the sheriffs power to postpone the date of possession for a period not exceeding three months. But because of their lack of security and their relationship with a resident landlord, few such tenants have ever made use of that right to apply for a reasonable rent or to seek to remain in the property after the landlord has intimated that he wished them to vacate. That is understandable because of the proximity of the resident landlord.<br><br>
Experience has shown Shelter that the most vulnerable people are often those in properties with a resident landlord. This is especially so in houses in multiple occupation where standards are frequently low. Severe overcrowding may be prevalent and charges can be extremely high in relation to the accommodation provided. The tenants of such properties are often highly vulnerable to exploitation by landlords. They have more frequent contact with them because they are resident.<br><br>
The lack of full rent Act protection for tenants of resident landlords has much worried housing workers—including Shelter—in recent years. Without security, such tenants and their advisers are virtually powerless to challenge high rents and to improve poor standards. The Bill's proposals exclude the further granting of any new part VII contracts. If all tenants with resident landlords are excluded from having assured tenancies, those tenants will have no security at all. They will even be deprived of their current limited security, as there will be no mechanism for appealing against a proposed rent increase. This in a sector of the rented market which is already noted for its high cost and is often subsidised through the housing benefit system. Therefore, the landlord will not have to institute possession proceedings and there will be no sanction against harassment and illegal eviction.<br><br>
Shelter and other organisations accept that when a landlord is resident—especially when a tenant shares the family home—he should be ble to exercise choice over whether, and with whom, he continues to share his home. But the purpose of the amendment is to illustrate that the exclusion from assured tenancies of all instances when a landlord is resident goes too far—at least in my submission and that of Shelter—and would leave such tenants without any protection whatever. That is of great concern, especially when the landlord essentially runs the property as a business. If this background and these representations—they were substantially made to me by Shelter—are borne out in fact, they merit the Committee's consideration.<br><br>
I and other Committee members are grateful to Shelter for drawing to our attention the problem which amendment No. 139 highlights. The amendment seeks to prevent landlords, who are resident in houses in multiple occupation, from gaining exemptions from the provisions relating to assured tenancies. Therefore, the two amendments sit closely, one with the other. Amendment
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 560</span>
No. 139 is important. Although there may be justification for excluding from protection tenants of families who take in one or two lodgers to the family home, there is no justification at all for excluding from such protection—as afforded by an assured tenancy—tenants of resident landlords who have several tenants. Those landlords run their properties as businesses and do not have the same concerns as families or individuals who let a spare room or two in their own homes.<br><br>
Even if the Government do not accept amendment No. 138 and our argument for the deletion of paragraph 9, amendment No. 139, if accepted, would prevent resident landlords in houses in multiple occupation from gaining exemption from providing assured tenancies. Shelter submits that, without the amendment, tenants in houses in multiple occupation will be deprived of all protection if their landlord is resident. There will be no sanctions against such a landlord who harasses his tenants and no requirement to obtain a repossession order.<br><br>
The current limited protection granted by part VII contracts will no longer apply to new tenancies granted by resident landlords in houses in multiple occupation. Tenants in houses in multiple occupation are frequently young, vulnerable and pay high costs for low standard accommodation. To challenge the high costs and obtain better standards, they must be given some security of tenure. Paragraph 9 of schedule 4, as drafted, allows a landlord up to six months in which to take up residence in a property foreclosed before ceasing to qualify as a "resident landlord", provided that he intimates his intention to take up residence. That is perhaps understandable or justifiable when, for example, someone buys a house but cannot move until he sells his own and does not wish the property to lie vacant in the meantime. However, it is not justifiable when a landlord makes his livelihood from rented property; he might use the provision to enable him to purchase a property and then re-sell it within six months, perhaps to a business associate, thus keeping open the option of obtaining vacant possession of the property in the longer term.<br><br>
We are worried that the proposal in the Bill will be used as a loophole. But our concern would be reduced if the exemption from providing assured tenancies were restricted to resident landlords with six or fewer tenants.<br><br>
In recent years, as I am sure the Minister knows, houses in multiple occupation have caused concern to the Government, local councils, housing workers and above all, tenants themselves. I apologise to the Committee for reciting my arguments "ad longam", but they are technical matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is Jedburgh dialect—.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The two amendments would give assured tenancies to those tenants of homes in multiple occupation. Otherwise, they have no protection at all, which could only lead to an increase in unsatisfactory use of such accommodation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 99 seeks to clarify paragraph 9(1)(a) of the schedule, which refers to a
<br><blockquote><p>"purpose-built block of flats".</p></blockquote>
That could be interpreted to mean a block initially so built and not a building converted to a block of flats. The amendment is based on that assumption. It suggests, in effect, that flats brought about by conversion of a building should be referred to in the Bill, if only for the avoidance

of doubt. Will the Minister give us his interpretation of paragraph 9(1)(a)? I ask him to give serious consideration to the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland will resist the trend of thought in amendment No. 138 because there seems a lot of difference between a person who rents out a room in his own house and a commercial landlord. The effect of the amendment would be that a landlord who wished to rent out a room would have to do so under an assured tenancy. That would be a major disincentive to people to rent out rooms in their homes. In my experience this is an important source of income for people in low incomes. It is now much easier for council tenants to rent out a room.<br><br>
9.45 pm<br><br>
I accept that there is a problem where there is multiple occupation. That is a different circumstance, so the fallback amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) raises a point worth considering. However, there are limitations on paragraph 9 and the circumstances in which the exclusion would apply. There are major problems about defining a number, as the hon. Gentleman did. He spoke of six, but any number will cause problems either side. I shall be interested to hear the comments of my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State on amendment No. 139, but I hope that he resists amendment No. 138.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not disagree with the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart). Amendment No. 138 can be seen as the blunderbuss and amendment No. 139 the high-velocity rifle. We cannot escape the fact that there is a serious problem, especially with multiple occupation dwellings.<br><br>
I have experience of one such establishment in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion). It is an old children's home which now houses quite a mixture of individuals, including people who otherwise would be homeless. What is interesting is the spread of residents there. In the main, they are children who have spent much of their life in local authority care and have lost all contact with their parents. They were desperate when they reached age 16, depending on which powers put them there, and wanted to escape the influence of the local authority. They have gravitated towards this type of establishment, which gives them the most basic accommodation. There are many ex-offenders and persistent offenders who cannot get accommodation elsewhere.<br><br>
There are also many psychiatric and mentally handicapped patients there. They have been encouraged to move out into the community because of the change in policy in the past 10 years. While I applaud the change in policy and like to think that I played a part in the early years of its development, I do not think we can lose sight of the fact that many of them are less secure out of hospital than they were in it. They become drifters and end up in the type of place I am describing, in a maelstrom of undesirable and less desirable elements. Many are people who would not benefit one whit from being left to their own devices in the community. I should like to develop this point about the lack of resources for adequate community care, but not here and now.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 562</span>
Those are the kind of people we are discussing as tenants—people who will be without any rights whatever if the Bill goes through as drafted. They will be excluded totally from what we might regard as basic protections. They will be left at the mercy of fairly ruthless individuals who run this sort of establishment. Every city, and some towns, have them. This part of the market concerns me greatly because many vulnerable people find their way into such places.<br><br>
I make no apology for repeating that these places tend to be outwith the local authority reaches because they do not qualify for registration under the social work Acts. They are not social work establishments, but are run purely on commercial grounds. They can be likened to hotels but, in effect, they provide a main residence for such people. They are not subject to supervision other than the firemaster's in respect of fire certificates, but that says nothing about the exploitation there.<br><br>
In the main, they are funded and huge sums are to be made from the housing benefit system because the great majority of these tenants have not been in employment—certainly not during my experience of the place. All have had their rent paid from the housing benefit system, from public funds. They will continue to, regardless of the changes in April, because they are at the lowest end of the income scale. This area needs control.<br><br>
Amendment No. 139 seeks to place some control on such establishments. It is not the control I should like to see, but at least it is a start. It gives the tenants there basic minimum rights which everyone is entitled to if they look on such establishments as their normal or main residence. There is a clear difference between a student who is in a flat for a few months of term or in a holiday residence. The people I have mentioned have such places as their only or main residence and they need protection.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I found the Shelter briefing material rather complicated. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) for putting them on record and saving someone else the task.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) said that we are in a sort of twilight zone of housing at the moment. We are talking of some of the most vulnerable people. This type of accommodation is only one stage removed from sleeping rough in many respects. As I understand the Shelter briefing, legislation leaves a complete gap here. The Bill deals with Scottish housing and the whole question of protection and security and rents, and if ever a group of people in Scotland needed a framework of protection and support it must surely be those in this type of accommodation. I hope that the Minister will give an undertaking that he will step in to support this category of tenant even if the amendments are unacceptable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to respond and I agree with the hon. Gentleman that amendments Nos. 99 and 139 are the most significant.<br><br>
It is common ground between us that people should be encouraged to let spare rooms in their houses. Letting such as this provides an important supply of often short-term accommodation for people who value the comfort of lodging in a family home. It plays an important role in providing homes for people who otherwise would be in danger of homelessness—for example, young single
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0388">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 563</span>
people such as students or young professionals. So, despite the apparent purpose of amendment No. 138, which the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) tabled, I agree with the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) in that respect. No doubt the Committee agrees that it is reasonable for landlords in the type of case I have described not to have to be bound by the controls associated with assured tenancies.<br><br>
A similar exemption has applied under the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984, and I know that concern has been expressed about abuses of that exemption. We believe there will be less scope for abuse under the provision in the current Bill, because to qualify as a resident, a landlord must have his only or principal home in the same building as his tenants.<br><br>
I have some sympathy with both the attempt to treat some conversions in the same way as purpose-built flats, and the move to limit the number of tenants that a landlord can have if he is to qualify for exemption as a resident landlord. However, I am afraid that, technically neither amendment is wholly acceptable. It is, in fact, enormously difficult to define conversions in such a way that only those conversions are covered which have led to flats equivalent for all practical purposes to blocks of flats built as such from the outset.<br><br>
Amendment No. 99, despite its ingenious references to various local authority procedures, would still spread the net too wide. Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment as drafted. However, I am prepared to ask my officials to explore with the draftsman whether any acceptable formulation can be found and to consider introducing an amendment at a later stage.<br><br>
I am also prepared to take away and consider amendment No. 139 tabled in the name of the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire. I am not sure that the amendment as drafted is correct, but I understand the strength of the argument that a landlord with a large number of tenants is not likely to represent the sort of case we are trying to deal with. Therefore, I hope that Opposition Members will accept my assurances and not press the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister argued that the provision for the landlord to have his only or principal home in the building was a sufficient safeguard in most cases. Therefore, will he consider the case where an unscrupulous landlord employs an agent to pose as a landlord living in a building to exploit young and vulnerable people? That is commercial exploitation and not a real attempt to provide housing. Therefore, the Minister's argument is not sufficient.<br><br>
However, I was happy to hear the Minister say that he is prepared to look at the position again and try to draft a suitable amendment to deal with this serious problem. My hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) said that this is a serious problem in many Scottish cities. He also referred to the position in Dundee. I, for one, would be happy for the Minister to come up to Dundee. I could show him the sort of establishments where such exploitation is going on—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: And give him protection?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I keep saying that if the Minister comes up to Dundee that will help the Tory vote go down to 5,000. However, I am happy to take the Minister round
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 564</span>

<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is saying that when a landlord is not resident within a building, but is—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I said that he was using an agent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the landlord is using an agent and acting improperly, local authorities can exercise considerable powers over houses in multiple occupation. I outlined a few of those powers earlier for the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Doran). However, if the hon. Gentleman has any evidence to support his remarks perhaps he will be good enough to send it to me and I will look into the matter. However, in the light of the two assurances I have given, I hope that the two amendments will not be pressed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is very helpful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am reasonably content with those assurances. I understand that we are talking about difficult issues and, on that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

The amendments deal with a series of situations affecting housing associations. The Minister earlier made a number of valuable concessions and undertook to consider earlier provisions affecting the position of housing associations. My interest here is to try to establish a fall-back position if the Government set their face against any movement along the lines of amendment No. 162. It may help the Committee if I concentrate on the one remaining area of concern covered by the amendments. Other Members may then pick up the discussion and my hon. Friends may speak to any of the other amendments.<br><br>
I shall concentrate on amendment No. 154, which seeks to insert a new paragraph (j) in schedule 4(11), which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"a registered Housing Association which is letting a dwelling to an existing secure tenant of that Housing Association who is transferring from an unsuitable dwelling."</p></blockquote>
The amendment deals with a problem which stands separate from the problems dealt with in the other amendments, and I hope that the Government will agree to examine it further. I am reinforced in that wish because the Minister's colleagues in the Committee on the equivalent English Bill, although he may not realise it yet, have been confronted with amendments in similar terms from sister organisations of housing associations south of the border, and have undertaken to examine the position and reconsider the relevant provisions in the English Bill. I think that the debate in that Committee took place last week. I am sure that the Minister's colleagues at the Department of the Environment would be willing to discuss the matter with him so that consideration of the position in Scotland can be on all fours with the consideration given to the similar position in England.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 566</span>
The purpose of amendment No. 154 is to try to ensure that when a secure tenant transfers to another house in his or her landlord's stock, the terms of the tenancy remain the same. The Minister has had enough experience of housing associations to recognise that they are regarded as good and caring landlords. Housing associations are able to look sympathetically at their housing management policies, and I know from my constituency that they apply that ability very beneficially. For example, if a house or flat allocated to a housing association tenant becomes unsuitable due to size, location, and so on, the housing association tranfers the tenant to a more suitable house if at all possible. It is blindingly obvious that that is a good step to take and makes sense in everybody's book. It is good for the tenants, good for the housing association and good for the locality, because it makes the most efficient use of the housing stock available.<br><br>
That practice would largely be discouraged if tenants accepting from their existing landlord a new tenancy that was undertaken in the common interest of the tenants and the housing association were to become assured rather than secure tenants. It would be a disincentive to that good practice. As a result of moving to more suitable accommodation, tenants would lose some of their existing rights, including the right to register rent, and might have to pay a higher rent for a smaller property. Therefore, there are some tenants who could be adversely affected by this part of the Bill, particularly elderly people, people with restricted mobility who seek to move to a ground floor flat or sheltered accommodation, and families who seek larger or smaller accommodation according to an increase or decrease in their size.<br><br>
10.30 pm<br><br>
The advantages of the policy which I have described is not restricted to the tenant. There is a real benefit to housing associations to be derived from accommodating a person in housing need in a property vacated by others whose needs it does not meet. Housing associations are concerned, with some justification, that if the proposals are enacted in their present form, tenants will remain in unsuitable accommodation rather than transfer to more suitable housing with restricted security and potentially higher rents. I do not believe that the Government are trying to impede the reconciliation of housing need with housing stock, or to bar housing associations from the good management practice of transferring tenancies when there is a real need to do so, but in my view and that of the housing associations and the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations, the Bill will bar activity of that sort.<br><br>
The subject has been raised in the Committee on the English Housing Bill, and the Minister there has recognised the need to re-examine it. In the light of the Scottish Minister's undertaking to consider some of the other provisions in the Bill as they affect housing associations, I implore him to examine this small area to see if he can, in concert with his colleagues, ensure that the facility which I have described is still available without bar both to the housing associations and to existing tenants relocating within housing associations or within the private sector.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Arbuthnot <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wanstead and Woodford)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to support, at least to some extent, what the hon. Gentleman has said. If a housing association tenant living in accommodation that is too big for him may be deterred from moving out of it into smaller accommodation

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 567</span>
because he would lose his secure tenancy and become an assured tenant instead and might have to pay a higher rent for smaller premises than he paid for his previous accommodation, there is a real problem which ought to be considered.<br><br>
On a legal and rather pedantic point, I am not sure that the amendment would achieve what it seeks, because it falls under paragraph 11 on exclusions from assured tenancies. The Bill as amended would read:
<br><blockquote><p>"A tenancy under which the interest of the landlord belongs to—</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(j) a registered Housing Association which is letting a dwelling to an existing secure tenant".</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>In theory, a tenancy in Glasgow under which the interest of the landlord belongs to a registered housing association which is letting a dwelling in Edinburgh to an existing secure tenant would be caught by the amendment.</p></blockquote>
The drafting of the amendment would have to be considered, but I do not think that it comes under the right paragraph of the schedule or the Bill. Nevertheless, the hon. Gentleman raised a valid point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister had better look to his laurels. That was an example of a Back-Bench Member giving the classic rebuff. This sitting of the Committee has been an exciting experience in two respects. Never before in my career of almost 10 years sitting in Standing Committees dealing with Scottish legislation have I heard Conservative Back Benchers criticising the Government, but earlier today the right hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) made some interesting remarks, and now the hon. Member for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Arbuthnot) has made a positive contribution to the debate. If he continues like that, we shall ask for him to sit on many Scottish Standing Committees in future. That is a threat.<br><br>
This group of amendments is intended to expand the definition of local authority and other tenancies which cannot be regarded as assured tenancies. We do not like the concept of assured tenancies as expounded by the Government, and we want to extend as far as possible the exemptions from that new kind of tenancy. We have already explained the reasons for our views. It seems to us that there is a case for extending the scope of public sector tenancies, as defined in paragraph 11, to include housing association tenancies. I anticipate that the Government will reject that principle in spite of anything that we may say, but I want to put it on record that we believe that there is a case for continuing to regard housing associations as being in close partnership with the public sector. They should be protected accordingly.<br><br>
Like the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood), I shall focus on amendment No. 154, which deals with transfers within housing associations. How often have we heard criticism of the fact that there are under and over-occupied houses in the public sector or any other sector? It has been suggested that it is unsatisfactory for a single person to live in a four-apartment house when there are families waiting for houses elsewhere. We must try to strike a balance. We believe in security of tenure and we would not put pressure on people who do not want to leave their houses. Nevertheless, in the course of our constituency work we often come across cases of elderly, single people who would love to be able to transfer to a smaller flat in the right area. At the same time we come across families in small, overcrowded accommodation who would love to be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 568</span>
able to move into the larger accommodation that is under-occupied. If a mutual transfer can be arranged, it will be to everyone's benefit.<br><br>
Amendment No. 154 refers to such mutual transfers within housing association properties. I understand that a transfer of the sort that I described within a housing association would mean that both sets of tenants would no longer be secure tenants. They would have assured tenancies and would have to pay higher rents with less security. The same applies to a range of transfers and relets within housing associations. That goes not only for specialist housing associations dealing with the handicapped or the elderly but for any area housing association dealing with the general needs of a local community in, for example, an urban renewal project such as that in your constituency, Mr. Martin.<br><br>
The Bill's present drafting is certain to create difficulties. It will make people reluctant to transfer if they know that in so doing they will sacrifice important rights. The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire has drawn attention to the fact that the Department of the Environment, which is dealing with the English Housing Bill further down the Corridor, has already shown its willingness to amend the legislation on this category of transfer or relet. As that important concession has been made for elsewhere in the United Kingdom, it it not too much to ask the Minister to incorporate a similar amendment here.<br><br>
I repeat that we should like a much broader definition of local authority or public sector tenancies to include the whole range of housing association property.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is important that the Minister concedes the principle that the Bill should include protection for housing association tenants. For example, he knows about the award-winning Upper Dens project in Dundee. It involves the conversion of an old jute mill in the inner city into an exciting new housing development. The Secretary of State for Scotland visited it and praised it for being the first ever Scottish winner of the Royal Town Planning Institute silver jubilee award. It showed how public sector bodies could co-operate productively to provide an exciting project and involved the Housing Corporation, several housing associations, the city of Dundee district council and the Scottish Development Agency.<br><br>
An important part of the project was providing housing for specialist needs. The new building catered for people with special needs including the elderly, the disabled and single people. Several specialist housing associations were involved. The Servite housing association, which largely provides sheltered housing for the elderly and some supported accommodation for vulnerable single people, provided about 38 sheltered units in the Upper Dens project as well as accommodation for 68 elderly people with warden accommodation to support them and common rooms.<br><br>
The Gowrie housing association is locally based in Dundee and specialises in providing housing for single people who are mentally ill or for those with mentally handicapped people throughout the Tayside region in north-east Fife. The Gowrie association has provided 53 flats for 71 single people under 60, as well as a family house and 13 flats for 27 people who have a mental illness or handicap and who need support to enable them to live in the community as independently as possible.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0391">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 569</span>
The project was conceived, planned, designed and implemented on the basis that tenants able to take advantage of the project could do so under the existing rights enjoyed by tenants, with rent control and security of tenure. It was never envisaged that those who might benefit from the Upper Dens project in future would have to do so with a weaker security of tenure than they might enjoy elsewhere in the city of Dundee. I hope that the Minister will concede that important principle.<br><br>
The exciting project received praise from Government and intention behind it was laudable. Surely it would be tragic if the Minister allowed the project to be diverted from its laudable purposes in future, so that people were penalised by attempting to benefit by being housed within it. The amendments would protect the Gowrie and Servite housing associations from the weakening of security of tenure that will result if the Bill is enacted as drafted.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will give way on this principle. It is a fair one and the Government will lose nothing by allowing housing association tenants to be brought under the protection offered to Scottish Homes tenants and to local authority tenants.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In responding to the debate, there are two issues to raise. One is the whole group of amendments and the second is amendment No. 154, to which I shall return.<br><br>
As for the whole group, which were discussed by the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson), their effect would be to disapply the conditions of assured tenancy either for all registered housing associations, in the case of amendment No. 269, or for a number of different types of housing association and for certain specified letting situations, in the case of other amendments.<br><br>
Opposition Members appear to have in mind the retention of the status quo for all or some housing associations mentioned in the amendments. I cannot see any reason for singling out some associations as being less appropriate to the use of assured tenancies than others or housing associations as being less appropriate than other landlords to which assured tenancies will be available.<br><br>
We consider that new housing associations should let on assured tenancies for two reasons. First, they have reached a stage in their development at which it is appropriate for them to assume greater financial responsibility for their own affairs. It is incompatible with that change for their rents to continue to be set by the rent officer. They should make their own decisions about rents, which I would expect to be at a reasonable level, which the introduction of assured tenancies will allow them to do. They will take on this new responsibility only gradually, of course, since assured tenancies will only apply to future lettings and existing tenancies will continue on the present basis.<br><br>
10.45 pm<br><br>
The second reason is to allow housing associations access to private finance, so that the level of activity achievable can be increased. One of the Government's general aims is to remove obstacles to the contribution that can be made by private finance in housing. Housing associations in Scotland seeking private finance have been balked by the absence of any ability to manage their own financial affairs through control over rent levels. By
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 570</span>
contrast, substantial private finance has been available to housing associations in England in recent years because assured tenancies have been in operation. It would be unacceptable for associations in Scotland to be deprived of the opportunity to benefit from such investment.<br><br>
Amendment No. 154 was discussed by the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) and my hon. Friend the Member for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Arbuthnot) made what the hon. Member for East Lothian described as a positive and helpful speech.<br><br>
The amendment is directed specifically at tenants who move for good reason from one of a housing association's houses to another. The issue undoubtedly needs to be reexamined carefully, and it would make sense for it to be considered in detail in the discussions on the general subject of the rights of housing association tenants. I hope that the amendment will not be pressed in the same spirit as amendment No. 162 was not pressed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We welcome the apparent movement by the Government on the clause, but we want it translated into tangible form. There are irreconcilable objectives on the part of the Government. First, there is the will not just to promote housing associations but to free them from what the Government see as the restrictions on rent and security of tenure and from what we see as the safeguards applying to new tenants and especially to existing tenants.<br><br>
The main problem in considering the Minister's remarks without him accepting at least one of the amendments is how the Government intend to translate into reality the objectives that all parties in Committee seem to agree. Down the Corridor where the English Housing Bill is being considered, the Government are not so minded. I understand that they have restricted themselves to people moving because of houses requiring maintenance and to people who move to other properties where their tenancy rights may be threatened.<br><br>
The concession may be good enough for Conservatives in England and Wales but it is not good enough for Labour Members or, I hope, for Conservative Members in Scotland. We want to ensure that people such as widows and widowers, who may have remained in a family home within a housing association, do not lose rights, are not automatically hit by higher rents, do not become assured tenants or lose rights of succession and other allied rights if they vacate the tenancy and move to another property run by the housing association.<br><br>
I welcome the Minister saying that the Government will draft their own amendment, if they think that our amendments are on the right lines but incorrect because of wording, phraseology, or legal terminology.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understood the Minister to say that he would reconsider amendment No. 154. That amendment deals specifically with people who transfer from houses within one housing association. However, the Minister did not reply to my points about the Upper Dens project, the houses run by the Servite housing association, sheltered accommodation for elderly people or the Gowrie housing association which provides housing for the mentally handicapped.<br><br>
The people who now enjoy tenancies within those projects do so on the basis of a fair rent and security of tenure. I am worried that, in future, people will come into
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0392">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 571</span>
that housing from local authority housing stock and will not be covered by the provisions in amendment No. 154. Someone could easily transfer from a district council house to the Upper Dens project, perhaps from a mental hospital, and I want to know what his position will be. My understanding of the Bill is that if anyone moves after this legislation is enacted it will be on the basis of an assured tenancy and not on the basis of security of tenure or rent control that now exists for tenants already living within that project. That means that the position of people who move into that housing after the Bill is enacted will be weaker than those who are already in occupation.<br><br>
I was particularly worried by the Minister's reference to housing associations taking on greater financial responsibility for their own affairs through assured tenancies. The Minister seemed to be saying that Scottish Homes would increasingly remove subsidy from housing associations and demand that accommodation was paid for through higher rents. Therefore, the Gowrie housing association within this project would have to charge substantially higher rents to people who came into the project after the Bill is enacted.<br><br>
The Minister appears to be arguing that when the Bill is enacted anyone who moves into accommodation specifically provided for the mentally ill, mentally handicapped or the elderly will have to do so on a weaker basis than those people who enjoy such accommodation now. That worries me. Those people will have less security of tenure and will have to pay market rates for their accommodation because housing associations are having their arms twisted by the Government to force market rents upon them.<br><br>
People drawing housing benefit will be protected, but I am worried about the people whose incomes are just above the level of housing benefit who are excluded by this legislation. Up to 1 million people in Scotland will be taken out of housing benefit and penalised because this legislation is a disincentive for them to take advantage of this type of housing—they will be unable to afford it.<br><br>
I appeal to the Government to think about specialist need housing for the mentally ill, mentally handicapped, the elderly and the vulnerable young and exclude them from the Bill's provisions for assured tenancies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must make the position quite clear. New housing associations will be assured tenancies. Rents will be fixed by housing associations, and I expect them to be fixed at reasonable levels.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman raised the question of the Upper Dens, and I shall be very happy to look into the cases that he mentioned. However, from what I heard from the hon. Gentleman they refer to a different set of circumstances from those contained in amendment No. 154. I am due to go to Dundee shortly and I shall look into the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister mentioned fair rents. Could he give us an idea of his figures for fair rents?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I could not give a precise range at this stage but I expect those rents to be fixed at a reasonable level.<br><br>
I said that I would take forward in discussions the point raised in amendment No. 154. I appreciate the anxiety of Opposition Members to ensure that the matter is resolved as early as possible. We have already undertaken on amendment No. 162 to look at the general question of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 572</span>
rights of housing association tenants with the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations and the Housing Corporation.<br><br>
In response to the question of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South about rent levels, housing associations will not be asked to charge market rents. We have made it clear repeatedly that their rents will be subsidised, particularly in the special circumstances described by the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for going as far as he appears to have gone on the idea of amendment No. 154. He is right to reconsider it, and to think about what his English colleagues are doing. Against that background, it would be churlish for the Committee to do other than give him time and space, bearing in mind that we consider this an extremely important part of the Bill's provisions and that we assume his investigations and further thoughts will bear fruit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I repeat that under the circumstances we shall expect the Minister to advise the Committee of the outcome as early as possible, preferably before Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree. It is clearly the spirit on all sides of the Committee. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 248, in clause 14, page 9, line 32, leave out from 'tenant' to 'and' in line 34 and insert 'occupies any sleeping accommodation'.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we shall discuss the following amendments:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 249, in page 9, line 36, leave out 'separate' and insert 'sleeping'.</p>
<p>No. 259, in page 9, line 36, after 'of, insert 'this accommodation or'.</p>

<p>No. 302, in page 10, line 17, at end insert
<br><blockquote><p>'(5) for the purposes of this section "living accommodation" means accommodation which includes a kitchen, and bathroom with toilet.'.</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The main purpose of clause 14 is to provide that if a tenant shares some of his accommodation with a person or others apart from his landlord, the fact of sharing alone should not preclude the tenancy from being an assured tenancy. We welcome that protection. The amendments seek to extend protection further to those who share sleeping accommodation and other common accommodation—for example, a bathroom or a kitchen. The amendment was recommended by Shelter and we are grateful for the diligent work it has done in an area of which it has considerable experience. This is yet another loophole through which the more unscrupulous landlords have attempted to evade their responsibilities under existing rent legislation.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0393">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 573</span>
Shelter has given examples of the main difficulties. It came across a case in which 40 people in one establishment shared six WCs. Six people were found sharing one bedroom. An eighteen-year-old girl who was seven months pregnant was evicted with no notice and for no apparent reason because the landlord sought the protection that the existing loophole gave and evicted her without her having recourse to the court for her protection.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. May we have order in Committee please.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are on television.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are not on television yet.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They will not get much out of me.<br><br>
11 pm<br><br>
Shelter discovered that at least 5,000 people in Edinburgh live in houses of multiple occupancy. We are back to the area of people who constantly slip through the protective net. They tend to be the most at risk—children out of care, people from psychiatric or mental handicap hospitals and ex-offenders. They are the very young and the very vulnerable. They appear to slip through the net and cause considerable concern because they are the most exploited. We ask simply that the Minister reconsiders this area of greatest vulnerability. He should extend the protection to include people in shared sleeping and other shared accommodation.<br><br>
It is worth pointing out that housing legislation already knows the expression "sleeping accommodation". Section 136 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 contains a definition of "room standard" which includes the term "sleeping accommodation". It would be a simple extension of the existing protection to this vulnerable group to include sleeping accommodation with other shared accommodation. It would close yet another loophole.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will be reasonably sympathetic to the case advanced by the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran). I am no expert on the technicalities of the hon. Gentleman's amendments but the Committee will no doubt have considerable sympathy with his point about an especially vulnerable group of people. I live in Glasgow although I represent a constituency to the south of the city. The kind of people the hon. Gentleman mentioned are a particular problem there.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman also spoke of sleeping accommodation. I am unsure of the answer but it seems a technical point of some validity which my hon. Friend might be able to answer. In principle, whether or not my hon. Friend is able to accept the amendments from a technical standpoint, I hope that he will accept that the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South has raised a genuine point about a section of the community which worries each member of the Committee, especially those of us who represent urban areas.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments seek to extend the assured tenancy regime for tenants who share accommodation and have no exclusive accommodation. Under Scots common law, a tenancy cannot be a tenancy without exclusive occupation.<br><br>
I recognise the arguments behind the amendments. The Opposition are trying to deal with the question of exclusive
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 574</span>
occupation. Clause 12 makes it clear that for a tenancy to be assured the tenant must have exclusive occupation of the accommodation. Clause 12(14) extends the protection to people who have exclusive occupation of only part of their accommodation. The restriction of assured tenancies to cases of exclusive occupation is not an attempt to create a loophole. It is simply that under Scots common law a letting is not a tenancy unless the tenant has exclusive occupation.<br><br>
Clause 14 deals with an important issue. It is necessary to ensure that tenants who share some of their accommodation have the protection of the assured tenancy arrangements. Without the clause such a tenant would risk having the use of his shared accommodation made so difficult or impracticable that he would feel obliged to leave, thus making nonsense of the protection that he should enjoy as an assured tenant. The amendments are directed at a problem that arises in houses of multiple occupation, predominantly in larger cities and boroughs. Although I have some sympathy with the matters raised, neither the clause nor the amendments are, in my view, the best way to deal with the problem. Indeed, I am not even convinced that the Bill is the correct vehicle for that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has implicitly acknowledged that a problem exists, but that our proposals are not the right way to deal with it. It is always useful when a Minister acknowledges—on the record—a problem. Heaven knows, there is a problem in this category of accommodation where people are badly exploited. It is a twilight area, almost outside the law.<br><br>
The Minister used a significant phrase. He acknowledged that a problem exists; we believe that it is serious, with extremely disturbing cases of exploitation coming to light from time to time. If the Government recognise that problem, will the Minister tell us the right way to deal with it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with care to the debate on the amendments. There appears to be an acknowledgment that some action might be necessary to solve the problems faced by people in such accommodation. I agree with the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson), although that may disturb him a little. For a long time I have been concerned about the accommodation of those who live in cities. Perhaps because their pay is insufficient to enable them to obtain a tenancy at a price which they can afford, many enter into an arrangement under which they share accommodation with others. Something needs to be done to help them. I do not know whether the amendments and the clause are the best or the only way to solve that problem.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State seemed to acknowledge, on behalf of the Government, that problems exist. However, as I understand my hon. Friend, he believes that clause 14 is essential to cover the matters which he mentioned. I do not know whether the amendments would cater for the needs of those people whose problems have been highlighted. However, I hope that sympathetic consideration will be given to their plight.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was a little surprised to hear the Minister refer to the common law. He is right that the common law relates to exclusive possession if a proper tenancy is to be established. But we are dealing with the statute law which
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0394">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 575</span>
has overlaid and totally removed most aspects of the common law relating to landlord and tenant. In that respect, the Bill already makes an exception to the common law principle because clause 14 accepts that shared accommodation—that is, accommodation in which tenants do not have an exclusive right of occupancy—comes within the ambit of the assured tenancy as defined. We want to expand the clause and to take it one small step further to where landlords are known—the experience of Shelter, a non-political organisation has revealed this to be so—to exploit the existing Rent Acts. That would not be a giant step.<br><br>
I am heartened by the comments by the hon. Members for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) and for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker). Clearly, from their own experiences, they recognise the problem. I am unhappy that the Minister trys to hide behind common law. The history of rent legislation this century has been a move away from the common law.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was asked about the best way forward. My own conviction is that the most appropriate way forward is not within the context of the Bill. I believe that this major issue needs to be considered separately in the context of houses in multiple occupation. We shall give the matter full consideration at a later day and consult about the best way forward.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are getting into interesting new territory. The Minister seemed to suggest that it might be the Government's intention to introduce legislation on the subject of houses in multiple occupation in Scotland. That would be a matter of considerable interest. Can the Minister confirm that the Government are considering such action?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Earlier, in response to the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths), I laid out in detail three of the measures that are available to local authorities to curb the abuses that occur in relation to houses in multiple occupation. Furthermore, the Public Health (Scotland) Act 1897 gives local authorities the power to make by-laws which can relate to conditions in houses in multiple occupation, and the Housing (Maintenance of houses and buildings in multiple occupation) (Scotland) Regulations 1964 give more details about the powers of local authorities to require landlords to improve the conditions in such houses. A further power available to local authorities in their dealings with houses in multiple occupation derives from their administration of housing benefit. The Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 1987 state that if a local authority considers
<br><blockquote><p>"that the rent payable … is unreasonably high by comparison with the rent payable in respect of suitable alternative accommodation",</p></blockquote>
it may in certain circumstances calculate housing benefit on a reduced level of rent. That provision is intended to prevent landlords from abusing the housing benefit system. There are various other powers, as I mentioned earlier.<br><br>
I regard this as a specialised subject and I do not think that it is best dealt with in the part of the Bill that covers renting.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister finished with an example of local authorities' powers to reduce rent for housing benefit purposes. We are speaking about vulnerable people in a vulnerable situation with no protection. The existing rent
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 576</span>
Acts and the Bill will perpetuate a loophole in the legislation which makes those people vulnerable. If the rent were forcibly reduced because a tenant made a complaint, I have no doubt that that tenant would be out on the street. The amendment seeks to protect tenants from such abuse. It is a complex and difficult subject, but I suggest to the Minister that the way forward is to extend protection to tenants, rather than to tell local authorities that they have certain powers. Those powers may allow a landlord to be tackled if a complaint is brought by a tenant, but ultimately they do not help the tenant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was about to go home, before I strayed into this debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A part-time Member.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should not provoke me.<br><br>
After the Minister's intervention on the subject of houses in multiple occupation, I drew the same conclusion as the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson). I thought that the Minister was trailing prospective legislation. If that had been the case, it might have made me change my view. It is now clear, however, that the Minister was using that as a throwaway line to bat the provision out of court in the debate.<br><br>
I disagree fundamentally with the Minister. I agree with the comments of the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) that it is appropriate for the Bill to provide and extend the protection available to people under the new provision of assured tenancies where those people are affected by the problems of houses in multiple occupation. I see no reason in logic or in law why we should not seize the opportunity while we have it. Goodness knows when we shall have another housing Bill and hon. Members will be able to seek to extend protection. The problem is real and urgent. It has been identified by the Minister, if not by other Gevernment Members, yet the Minister says that this is not the best way of dealing with it. We shall have to wait for another Bill and probably another Parliament. That is not good enough. The amendments may be defective technically but with good will and good faith we could find a way of protecting people affected by this problem, later if not this evening.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not glean from the remarks of my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State that he anticipated future legislation. I would be alarmed at any such prospect.<br><br>
A genuine problem has been identified. I am no technical expert in this area and I am far from sure that the amendments are the correct way to handle it. I wonder whether my hon. Friend can assure us that he will be able to tell us Government thinking on the issue before Report?</span></p>
<p>11.15 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It will be open to hon. Members to return to the matter on Report, but I do not feel that I can now go any further.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will agree that that is a disappointing answer. It is almost one-and-a-half decades since the Minister served in local government. Surely he will know from that experience that the sort of powers available now and the powers available then to local government are not matched by the necessary resources to carry them out and do not match English legislation on the registration of landlords.

respects, we seek an assurance from the hon. Gentleman that the catalogue of legislation that he says is available to local authorities will be available specifically to local authorities. He knows, as I do, that even an authority such as Edinburgh—one of a number of Scottish authorities that have tried to take action against irresponsible exploitive landlords whom we all condemn—failed when it tried to use the very Act that he cited.<br><br>
The reason for the failure was twofold. First, the authority has barely the resources necessary to put into practice the Act's provisions. The Government have provided resources for purposes to which they are really committed, such a poll tax, and have offered additional administrative staff. Unfortunately, they have not done so for these purposes. I am therefore suspicious of the Minister's apparent conversion and commitment to legislation regulating landlords. Secondly, there is a key problem in the type of buildings the landlords have acquired. I give one example among many of where the landlord, using money from a building society, places tenants in a property in disgraceful Victorian conditions. When the council moves in to issue control orders and employs other legislation to try to secure decent accommodation for the tenants and exclude the landlord, the building society moves in. When that happened in Edinburgh, the advice of learned counsel was that the council would not win because the building society was bound to regain possession.<br><br>
It is clear from experience of the past 12 months—never mind before that—of using the new legislation that councils with a political will to do something about exploitive landlords have found it impossible to do so within existing parameters. We ask the Minister to take that on board either by adopting one of our amendments or offering the Committee one that is equally effective.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As with every other member of the Committee, the Minister has accepted that there is a genuine problem. There are people who share sleeping accommodation who are exploited by ruthless landlords. But what will he do about it? We all accept that technically the amendments may be unsuitable, but the Minister does not seem to be saying that. He says that the Bill is not the appropriate means for dealing with the problem, which should be handled through existing powers given to local authorities. As my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths) explained, the existing powers of local authorities are not sufficient and are not working.<br><br>
Shelter has drawn everyone's attention to the fact that people continue to be exploited despite local authority powers and that the authorities are not the best people to handle the problem. The best way would be to extend protection to those tenants through the Bill. Will the Minister explain why he will not do so via the assured tenancy proposals in the Bill?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State replies, perhaps the Committee will think seriously about the comments—no doubt based on experience—on the authority's attempt in Edinburgh to repossess a building in the interests of sub-tenants. The
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 578</span>
authority was advised by its legal advisers that the building society, which owned the property because it had advanced a loan to the landlord, would have regained possession. No doubt all this was due to some sort of default—perhaps on payment, if the building society had to move in. I doubt whether the amendments would deal with such a situation and the building society would still be able to take action. Effectively, the amendments would not achieve the Opposition's and our aim. On rereading the clause, I found the detail of it frightfully technical. I realised that only lawyers ever make money out of legislation, and no wonder, because at this time of night one realises how much of it one does not understand. Perhaps my hon. Friend will bear in mind my concern. I do not think anyone should feel that accepting the amendments would meet the problem, because it would not. The problem of the building society example would remain.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As we are likely to adjourn shortly, it would be no bad thing if the Minister had time to reflect a little further before the Committee reconvenes.<br><br>
The situation is most tantalising. Concern has been expressed by almost all Committee members about extremely vulnerable people being exploited in appalling accommodation and not covered by legislation. We have here a window of opportunity. We are in the House of Commons debating a Scottish housing Bill which could include a provision to help this group of people and take this type of tenancy into the law of Scotland. Hon. Members from all parts of the Committee have acknowledged the nature of the problem, and the Minister has accepted it. Such consensus in Committee makes this too good an opportunity to miss for Parliament to do something about the problem. How often do we hear the words, "We should do something about this." On this occasion, the Minister has the wherewithal and expertise to draft the necessary legislation. It should be a straightforward enough matter to bring that category of tenancy within the law and make it possible to regulate the practices of twilight landlords that we hear about from time to time.<br><br>
I urge the Minister to take up this opportunity, because it may be a long time before it comes again. If the people in Scotland whom we are talking about, who are in dreadful circumstances at home this very night, knew that there was a consensus in Parliament that something should be done to help them but the opportunity to do it was not being grasped, they would be very angry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister rightly pointed out the difficulties relating to multiple-occupancy tenancies. I remind him that he agreed to consider the proposal made on amendment No. 139, which deals exactly with that problem. It is a complex problem, but the Minister has the opportunity with his consideration of amendment No. 139 to look at this amendment, too. I ask him to consider both amendments together, because they deal with similar problems. I hope that he will be able to produce a similar solution to both.</span></p>
