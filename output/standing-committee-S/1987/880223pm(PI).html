</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>4.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the last few minutes before we broke adjourned this morning. I was dealing with points that had arisen in the debate. The honourable Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths) raised the point that landlords will be able to hoist rents. The clause applies only to registered rents set by rent officers or the rent assessment committee. Those rents are not set by the landlord. The tenant can always apply to have a rent registered by the rent officer and no higher rent is then payable than that set.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) asked how frequently orders will be brought forward. An order will
	<span class='label label-info column'>916</span>
probably be brought forward every two years. The phasing will be achieved in three stages, but it will depend on the circumstances and the impact of the timescale. An order will reduce phasing gradually, depending on the circumstances at the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 38 is evidence of our intention to reduce progressively the incidence of phasing of rent increases for tenancies covered by the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984. We intend to move steadily to increase the size of the increase permitted in each phase and to reduce the time between phases. After about five years, I expect us to bring forward orders to abolish phasing entirely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This clause is evidence of the Government's intention to increase rents, not just to do away with phasing. Such double-speak is most uncharacteristic of the Minister; he is usually totally honest. The line that he gave us about rents being controlled after they have been set by the rent assessment committee is not consistent with the document "Deregulation of the Private Sector: Consultation Paper on the Implications for Housing Benefit", which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The rent set by the rent officer will not be a maximum rent chargeable for the dwelling. It will be open to the landlord to set the rent at the maximum eligible level, or to charge a higher rent and seek a tenant willing to pay that rent. It will be open to the existing tenant, should he have the means to do so, to make up the difference."</p></blockquote>
Therefore, what the Minister said is not true, or is certainly not consistent with what the Government have said elsewhere about their determination to see rents go up and up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has not dealt with the point raised by the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations about the difficulty that the clause is likely to create in mainly innter city areas where the SFHA is trying to encourage an area renewal scheme. It has encountered fear among sitting tenants and even owner-occupiers who are alarmed at the prospect of their property being transferred to a housing association with unlimited rent increases in future years. The only way in which housing associations can encourage people to participate in such schemes is by giving guarantees of proper protection against massive rent increases. That problem is especially relevant for area renewal schemes in our inner cities that the Government say they are anxious to promote. How will housing associations in the inner cities of Glasgow or Dundee encourage people in private rented accommodation or owner-occupiers to have their property transferred to a housing association when there is no guarantee that their rents will be controlled?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to press the Minister a little further on how this part of the clause will be implemented. We are getting there slowly. He said that orders would be introduced in a two-year cycle in the first instance and the changes would be in three phases within that cycle. I may have got it wrong. If so, I am sure that he will put me right. Will the first order under this clause come two years after the implementation of the Bill? That is to say, will there be a two-year lay period during which no
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0583">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>917</span>
changes will occur to the provisions of clauses 33 and 58? That would give us an indication of how long we would have to adjust before the changes start.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it will be two years before the first order is laid, I am still confused about how the Minister envisages the Bill operating after that. We all know that a week is a long time in politics, and two years is certainly a long time. All sorts of things can happen in the interim. I expect the Government to follow carefully how the Bill operates in order to decide the next step. Will it be two years after the initial two-year period that the Minister will bring in a subsequent order? If so, will those orders stipulate three phases each to be organised in an equal time space within the period in which the orders are introduced so that there will be a biennial order to fix the phasing out of clauses 33 and 58 in three equal periods within those two years? I do not entirely understand the procedures, though the Government must have thought them through. There must be flexibility, but will the Minister tell us in more detail how the orders will be implemented. That is an important part of the clauses and amendments that we are discussing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As regards the timescale, it will not be two years after the implementation of the Bill. The order will probably be laid earlier than that, but not necessarily immediately after the Bill has been enacted. It depends on the impact on tenants. Each order will stipulate an adjustment to the period within which the increase can take effect. It will probably be every two years in three stages, but that depends on the circumstances prevailing at the time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"or paragraph (c) of subsection (2) of section 48 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987: and".</p></blockquote>
I should like to speak at length, but I understand that the Minister has had discussions with organisations such as Shelter on the principle of the amendment and that he will find a way of accepting that principle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the honourable Gentleman for drawing attention to the unintentional omission from the provision of cases where a secure tenant is moved to suitable alternative accommodation that is a protected tenancy. As well as section 48 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987, there is a similar provision in section 282. Amendment No. 452 will not achieve the right effect, but if the honourable Gentleman withdraws it, I shall table appropriate amendments later to cover both cases concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are grateful for that concession, but I am becoming increasingly anxious about our prospects on Report. How many days, or even weeks, will the Government set aside for considering all the amendments that the Government bring forward on Report? Clearly, it is for my honourable Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths) to decide whether he wants to press this important amendment to a vote or whether, in the light of the Minister's gracious concession, he will withdraw it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, on behalf of all my honourable Friends, I am worried about the problems that are bound to arise on Report. I understand that business managers have talked about a day and a half for Report. That period seems to be lengthening into some long days simply to get through the detailed amendments that will be necessary because of sloppy and unduly hasty drafting. Had the Government conducted their consultation and carried out their drafting more carefully, we could have avoided that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendments are necessary in this case because a protected tenancy should be allowed to continue if a tenant is moved through no choice of his own from one tenancy to another. The amendments that we shall table will deal with the two references to the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 that have been omitted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the other points that the honourable Gentleman raised, he is welcome to take them up through the official channels.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be guided by my honourable Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson), and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>(d) it is granted to a person (alone or jointly with others) who, immediately before the tenancy was granted, was the tenant (or one of the tenants) under a protected tenancy, or a secure tenancy, and the tenancy is granted by the landlord in such circumstances as may be determined by the Secretary of State by regulations".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may also discuss amendment No. 435, in page 24, leave out lines 31 to 37 and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"a protected or statutory tenant of a dwelling house which was let under a short tenancy which has ended and in respect of which there has been grant of a further tenancy;".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was pleased to learn from the previous debate that the Minister has had discussions with Shelter, which led him to accept the principle of that amendment, but I am disappointed that he has not had similar discussions on my amendment, which was also suggested by Shelter. Having read Shelter's justification for it, I see no reason why the Minister should not agree to it in principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 39 deals with three limited circumstances in which tenancies that begin after the enactment of the Bill can be protected tenancies, as defined in the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984. They are, first, when a tenancy begins as a result of contract agreed to before the enactment of the legislation; secondly, if the tenancy is a new tenancy of the same premises let to the same person who is a protected or statutory tenant immediately before a new tenancy arises; and thirdly, if the tenancy is "suitable alternative accommodation" provided for a tenant who has had an order for possession of his existing protected or statutory tenanted house made against him and the court has directed that the new tenancy should be a protected tenancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the view of Shelter and the Opposition, the clause is too restrictive. For example, it does not allow a landlord who may wish to grant a protected tenancy to do so. Clearly, landlords want to make the most efficient use of their housing stock to maximise the return on their investment. If a landlord has as tenants a family who have outgrown their existing accommodation and he also has available a larger property suitable for that family, who are good tenants, are not anti-social and who pay their rent punctually, it would be sensible if the family moved-to that new, larger accommodation. However, if the proposed move means that the family will have to surrender their protected tenancy status, the transaction may be jeopardised and the family may decide that it is not worth losing their tenants' right in moving from a protected to an assured tenancy. The family may refuse to move, which will be to their own disadvantage and that of the landlord.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, an elderly person who has been a life-long tenant and may have built up a close and friendly relationship with the landlord may, for reasons associated with age and health, wish to move to ground floor accommodation. The landlord may have available suitable accommodation that he is
	<span class='label label-info column'>920</span>
keen to offer his or her old friend and tenant, but again the rigidity of the clause and the penalty involved—the surrender of protected tenancy rights—may prejudice the transaction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a possible loophole in subsection (1)(c), which allows the landlord to seek a possession order on the ground that he will be providing suitable alternative accommodation for the tenant. That ensures that the tenant retains his or her protected tenancy on the transfer but it will involve both parties in a wholly unnecessary and unjustified waste of the courts' time in seeking possession through the courts. Moreover, being dragged through the courts is a worrying and unnecessary process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment suggested by Shelter covers all those circumstances. It introduces some flexibility into housing legislation and makes it possible for the Secretary of State for Scotland to determine circumstances where a protected ternancy may be granted, which otherwise would not be possible under the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Landlords should be able to allow tenants to transfer to other properties on a protected basis if both landlord and tenant agree. The principle of the amendment has been considered in the Committee on the Housing Bill. I think that the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of for the Environment, the honourble Member for Broxbourne (Mrs. Roe), has responsibility for housing in England and Wales. She agreed the principle of the Opposition's amendments when she led the Committee to understand that a tenant with a regulated tenancy who moved to other accommodation let by the same landlord would automatically have a regulated tenancy in the new accommodation and that private tenants would also be safeguarded, if they were moved for good management reasons. Those changes will also apply to housing association tenants. The Under-Secretary of State promised to table amendments to the Housing Bill on Report to give effect to the concessions that she made. They are important concessions because people repeatedly move to more suitable accommodation but remain under the same landlord, whether a private landlord or a housing association.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that people are not penalised for the natural aspiration to live in accommodation that meets their needs. If there is to be no penalty in England and Wales, there should not be in Scotland. What is good for tenants in England and Wales should be good for tenants in Scotland. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment. If he does not accept it, we shall want to know his objections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Shelter has pointed out that the amendment has been broadly framed to allow the Secretary of State to make regulations, to allow time for further consultation and to allow the Secretary of State to change the regulations in the light of experience. We do not wish to tie down the Government, but we are trying to make them concede the principle and make the same concessions for Scotland as for England and Wales. Shelter also says:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0585">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>921</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"The reason for the inclusion of a "secure tenancy" in the drafting of the amendment is to ensure consistency with Part II of Schedule 3 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987. Part II of that Schedule defines "suitable alternative accommodation". Included in that definition are 	<i>protected tenancies.</i> In some cases, for example, a local authority can only gain repossession of a house if it is offering suitable alternative accommodation; that suitable alternative accommodation does not necessarily have to be another tenancy of a council house, but could be a private rented house provided the tenancy will be on a protected basis. The proposed amendment would continue to allow public housing authorities to exercise their powers under the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 by 	<i>making available</i> suitable alternative accommodation on a protected tenancy basis. Otherwise, Clause 39 of the Bill as it stands, would seem to preclude this."</p></blockquote>
Amendment No. 435 excludes from the effects of clause 39, tenants who enjoy short assured tenancies. Shelter says that the purpose of the amendment is
	<br><blockquote><p>"To extend the proposed rights of protected tenants under the transitional provisions of the Bill to tenants under short tenancies to ensure that general principles of Scots Law are not contradicted …</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Short tenancies, by definition, are for a fixed term.—"</p></blockquote>
in this case six months—
	<br><blockquote><p>"However, like other contracts under Scots Law, unless either party to the contract gives notice of wishing to terminate the contract that contract will be renewed by operation of 'tacit relocation'".</p></blockquote>
The Committee has already spent a considerable time discussing the implications of that measure. Shelter continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Bill allows for this mechanism to continue to operate in the case of other protected tenancies but not in the case of short tenancies. The Bill should be amended to rectify this inconsistency.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Tenants who have entered into an agreement whether to rent a property under a protected or short tenancy, agree to both the terms of that particular contract and to the general terms of contract law as it exists in Scotland. As indicated above, those general terms allow for tacit relocation and to deny those rights to a particular class of tenant would be a contradiction of the principles of Scots Law. Nonetheless, should the landlord or tenant wish to formally terminate the agreement, preventing the operation of tacit relocation and create an assured tenancy, that option will still exist under the proposed amendment."</p></blockquote>
I have looked closely at Shelter's arguments in support of the amendments. I see no reason for the Government to oppose the amendments, particularly as they conceded the general principle of them in the Housing Bill. If the Minister will not concede that principle, perhaps we do not have a unitary Parliament after all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I can reply briefly to the honourable Gentleman. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, my honourable Friend the Member for Broxbourne (Mrs. Roe) was referring to housing association tenants who move from one part of the housing association property to another. I made it clear earlier that internal transfers within housing associations are being examined; we wish to allow such tenants to retain their secured tenancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Gentleman also raised the question of protected tenants transferring from one house to another and the possibility of them retaining their protected tenancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot accept either of the amendments. It has been argued that protected tenants who move to
	<span class='label label-info column'>922</span>
other accommodation should have the right to continue as protected tenants in certain circumstances. I do not think that a good enough case has been made for that in the case of private sector tenants. If a private sector protected tenant chooses to move to other private sector rented accommodation, he should be subject to the new assured tenancy arrangements. Clause 39 ensures that protected tenants who stay in the same house or are obliged to move to a new house remain protected unless they wish otherwise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to amendment No. 435. Tenants with short tenancies know when they enter the tenancy that it is for a limited period and that there is no guarantee that they can continue it thereafter. They are therefore aware that at the end of their tenancy they are likely to have to negotiate another tenancy, whether in the same house or not, in the private rented sector as it exists at that time. Therefore, I can see no case for making them continue as protected tenants in a new tenancy. Clause 39 makes it clear that in those circumstances they should be subject to the assured tenancy arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two amendments are misconceived. They would not help to achieve the aims of the Bill. Therefore, I ask the Committee to reject them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why have the Government been so inflexible about the transitional arrangements? I can foresee that landlords may sometimes—with tenants' agreement—wish to continue with the previous regime under which the tenancy was protected. The Government are taking that option away, except in the circumstances stipulated in the clause. Those circumstances are narrowly drawn, as I am sure that the Minister will admit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's prevailing political consideration in bringing forward the Bill is to provide choice. If so, why do not they allow landlords and tenants the option of retaining the protected tenancies of the present regime?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
None of the legislation will be retroactive, so legislation for the private rented sector will allow protected tenancies to subsist cheek by jowl with the new assured tenancies. What is wrong with allowing the maximum amount of transitional protection? The Minister could resort to the sheriff if he is still worried about landlords not getting enough leverage to move to the new assured tenancies. Instead of using this device for the transitional arrangements, he could set out a flexible scheme and give the landlord the right to go to the sheriff, who can determine whether the proposal is fair or reasonable in the circumstances.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that Shelter is right and that there will be circumstances in which the landlord may wish to avail himself, by agreement with the tenant, of the present protected tenancy provisions. The clause is inflexible, and unnecessarily so. I do not see why the Minister chose this procedure when other options were available to him. He said himself that no case had been made for moving in the opposite direction; indeed he has made no case for the provisions in his

own Bill. The clause is not adequate and should introduce more flexibility. The amendments may not be technically right, but a technicality should not be allowed to stand in the way of reconsideration of the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not happy that we are contributing to the Minister's insomnia for the next month, or however long it will take. However, I am glad that he has changed his view. Previously he thought that no case had been made and now, without having heard any further arguments, he is conceding the point. We welcome that concession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to reinforce the point about choice, made by my honourable Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion). Before the Bill was introduced, the Government said that they intended to extend the amount of choice available to tenants. Yet here they are precluding and forbidding any new tenancies in the private sector from coming under the protected tenancy system. They do not intend to phase out the regulated system altogether, which will still exist for tenancies in the public sector, local authority houses, Scottish Homes houses, and no doubt others such as those in new towns. Since the system will still exist, why is the Minister so determined that the landlord and tenant in the private sector, who might prefer to remain with the present tried and tested system, should be forbidden to do so?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) said that some landlords may prefer to avail themselves of the existing system. I must plead guilty. I have already registered my interest as a private landlord. Living next door to people who are nominally tenants of mine, I do not wish to get involved in the hassle of short, insecure, high-rent tenancies with my next door neighbours—life would not be safe. I would rather carry on under the present system, yet under the Bill that would be illegal. Private landlords would be compelled to go into the assured tenancy system whether they like it or not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What about the choice which the Government talk so much about? Landlords and tenants should have the choice over whether to avail themselves of the protected tenancy system in the future, as they could in the past. I think that the Minister has grasped that argument now. I shall welcome it if he is prepared to introduce yet another amendment on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for saying that he will reconsider the matter. However, we are concerned about his statement that the concessions in England were only for housing association tenants. On the Housing Bill for England and Wales, the honourable Member for Broxbourne (Mrs. Roe), the Under-Secretary of State, led the Committee to believe that a tenant with a regulated tenancy who moves to other accommodation let by the same landlord should automatically have a
	<span class='label label-info column'>924</span>
regulated tenancy in the new accommodation. She made no reference to whether the landlord had to be a housing association landlord. Private tenants will also be safeguarded if they are moved for good management reasons, for instance refurbishment of buildings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, good management reasons are the specific sort of reasons which Shelter pointed out. She went on to say that those changes would also apply to housing association tenants, which would suggest that earlier remarks have not referred to housing association tenants but to private sector tenants. It is important for the Minister to concede that his earlier remarks on the matter were not accurate, and that these concessions have generally been made in England to private sector tenants as well as housing association tenants, and should apply similarly in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment seeks to ensure that the Bill does not force housing associations into a corner with managing the stock. A key problem that we foresee is that any housing association tenant who seeks to transfer to alternative accommodation will encounter several impediments. If the housing association offers him a new tenancy, under the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0587">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>925</span>
clause at present it appears difficult for that tenancy to be other than on an assured basis. That would mean that his tenancy rights would be diminished in three ways. He would lose the right to a fair rent and the right of succession, and the new and detrimental rules regarding repossession would apply. No housing association tenant in his right mind would accept a new tenancy on that basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That throws up many problems. A tenant whose children have grown up and left home and who lives in an apartment house will be reluctant to accept a transfer within the same housing association to a house that is more suitable for an older person with no family.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, a family living in accommodation that is suitable for a young couple but which has become overcrowded with the subsequent arrival of children would have no great incentive to move, because of the losses I have outlined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, if a tenant becomes disabled or infirm and wishes a relative to stay and care for him, the rights of succession will mean that perhaps five years would have to elapse before the relative could succeed. That is a disincentive to relatives to move in to care for an ageing or ill parent or close relative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, tenants are unlikely to accept a move under the Bill's provisions. The consequences would be dire for a housing association, such as Edinvar in Edinburgh. It manages about 800 tenancies, but cannot afford to allow bottlenecks to appear. It is an association of high calibre with many years experience. It knows the value of being able to accommodate the needs of its tenants, while ensuring that what is good for the individual tenant is good for all tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to ensure that the type of management developed over the years by Edinvar and hundreds of other housing associations can continue. Our housing association movement has some of the best managers in the country if not the world. The clause would create divisions between the current tenants of housing associations and the current housing association management. If housing associations could not persuade tenants living in overcrowded or under-occupied accommodation to move, they would have to try other means. They could seek to repossess accommodation on the grounds that they were offering suitable alternative accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If housing associations had to take a heavy management hand to an individual tenant's problem, the results would be catastrophic. In the smaller housing associations everyone tends to know everyone else and it would cause bitterness at a personal level. In the larger housing associations, it would be exacerbated by the fact that it would appear to be the hand of Big Brother removing people from properties that they may have inhabited for many years, even before the housing association was formed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The techniques forced on management by the Bill would do nothing but harm to the relationship between management and tenants. If a manager turns
	<span class='label label-info column'>926</span>
up on a tenant's doorstep, even after having first sent the proper letter to say that the tenant must move to other suitable accommodation, a reasonable tenant would be worried that the heavy hand of the law would threaten. The Bill could do untold damage to housing associations, which have built up tremendous expertise in handling tenant relationships in a sensitive way that gives tenants a greater say in their housing than almost any other type of tenancy tenure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the tenants will stay put. They will not risk being moved and paying a higher rent. The Minister has given the order of the rent increases that are currently permissible. What he said contained the veiled, or not so-veiled, threat that rents can go through the roof if they command market prices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tenants who know that they can pass on the tenancy of their house to their children who live with them, will be fearful of having anyone to stay with them in what might appear to be a permanent arrangement, but which would have to permanent for five years. Tenants will also fear the loss of crucial rights if they become ill and fail to pay the rent. If rent payments become sporadic, they will face new, harsher rules for repossession with the possible loss of the new house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should reconsider the clause and accept the amendments so that the good relationships between housing associations and their tenants will continue and so that future relationships will be as good. What is in many cases a model of arrangement should not be disrupted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This debate is a re-run of Tuesday evenings' debate on amendment No. 154. That amendment was also directed specifically at tenants who move for good management reasons from one of a housing association's houses to another. I said that the issue needed to be re-examined carefully and suggested that it would make sense for it to be considered in detail in the discussions that will take place on the general subject of the rights of housing association tenants. However, subject to that, I accept the purpose behind this amendment and we shall introduce amendments to achieve that purpose if necessary. The honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am grateful to the Minister for going as far as he appears to have gone on the idea of amendment No. 154. He is right to reconsider it, and to think about what his English colleagues are doing.

	<div class='title'>NEW "PART VII" CONTRACTS LIMITED TO TRANSITIONAL CASES. 1984 c.58</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 479, in page 26, leave out lines 21 to 44.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is in my name alone. It seeks to remove lines 21 to 44. I am sure that the Minister has concluded from that blunderbuss approach that this is a problem amendment, which seeks to find out the intention of subsections (2) to (5). If my interpretation is right, the clause seeks to restrict the already limited rights of some part VII tenants who are resident in their tenancy with a resident landlord.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While improving the rights of tenants with board, the clause would remove even the limited protection of a part VII contract if the rent is increased or if the rent has not been registered. That would remove the limited rights incorporated in a part VII contract from those who need most protection; people whose rents have been increased or have not been registered. If that is so, the proposals in the clause should be opposed. I should be grateful if the Minister would consider that analysis and interpretation of clause 41.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If my interpretation is right, the Government intend to ensure that, if tenants with board lose part VII status, they will become assured tenants. Section 2(1)(b) of the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984 excludes from the provisions of a protected tenancy tenants whose rents include board. That section states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"under the tenancy the dwelling-house is bona fide let at a rent which includes payments in respect of board or attendance".</p></blockquote>
In those circumstances, a tenancy is not protected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I seek confirmation of that. If that interpretation is correct I welcome the proposal because it will give such tenants greater security, and must be one of the few occasions when the Bill achieves that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, my analysis may somehow be fatally flawed, because of a misunderstanding on my part. The issue is important, and if the Minister clarifies the intention of subsections (2) to (5), I shall be happy not to press this blunderbuss probing amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Far be it from me to agree with the honourable Member for Roxburgh and
	<span class='label label-info column'>928</span>
Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) that his judgment is flawed. On the strength of advice from Shelter, I understand that his interpretation is correct. Clause 41 will improve the protection afforded to tenants with part VII contracts who have exclusive use of some accommodation, but share some accommodation with people other than the landlord.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that clause 41 would allow those people to become assured tenants, if they agree to a variation in their rent with their landlords. However, in future, such people will have assured tenancies or assured short tenancies, rather than part VII contracts. That is a step in the right direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there is a sting in the tail, with which the amendment seeks to deal. The honourable Gentleman said that the amendment stands in his name only. We had spotted that. It is quite nice to get the honourable Gentleman to sing for his supper occasionally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all rely heavily on advice from such organisations as Shelter and the Scottish Council for Single Homeless, which have identified a potential problem with the clause. The negative effect of the clause would be the removal of all protection from current part VII tenants, if they agree to a variation in their rents, when they do not become the holders of either assured tenancies or assured short tenancies. Those having protection removed would mainly be tenants of resident landlords. We have discussed that problem already, and those tenants are a highly vulnerable minority who have precious little security. I am worried that the Government will reduce their already limited protection. The Minister said repeatedly that that is not his intention. If so, our advice from the Scottish Council for the Single Homeless and Shelter is that the clause must be amended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While we welcome the basic intention to improve security for part VII contract holders, the problem is that existing part VII contract holders who vary the terms of their arrangements with their landlords could lose out on that minor degree of existing protection. Neither the Minister nor any Committee member wants that to happen. Therefore, we are entitled to insist, either that the Minister gives us an assurance that that is not the effect of the clause, or that the clause will be amended here or on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In reply to the honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood), tenants with board are included as assured tenants if the other conditions are fulfilled. We are deliberately increasing the security of such tenancies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Gentleman also asked about the interpretation of subsections (2) and (3). Subsection (2) provides that a variation of an existing part VII contract will be construed as the creation of a new contract, which will not be a part VII contract. However, it will be subject to the assured tenancy arrangements, unless exempted under schedule 4. Subsection (3) qualifies subsection (2), by providing that a variation in rent will not amount to a new contract, and the part VII contract will be allowed to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0589">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>929</span>
continue if it results from a reference to the rent assessment committee, under section 56 of the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 41 may seem complicated, but its purpose is straightforward. It seeks to limit the creation of new part VII contracts to certain circumscribed cases. The general intention is that new part VII contracts will not be created after the commencement of this legislation. Lets which would have been part VII contracts will in future be assured tenancies, unless they fall into one of the exempted categories in schedule 4 of the Bill. That being so, we believe it is right to phase out part VII contracts as quickly as possible. They have always been something of an anomaly and the new arrangements will be much tidier. That is why we are proposing that any change in the rent of a part VII contract should amount to creating a new contract, subject to the new rules unless the new rent follows from a reference to the rent assessment committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part VII contracts anyway tend to be of short duration, so I do not expect many people to be affected by the provisions in clause 41. In any case, I am sure the provisions amendment 479 seeks to remove are essential to ensure a smooth transition to the new arrangements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to study what the Minister has said and with the details of part VII available, consult some of the bodies that have been advising Committee Members. I have doubts about the restrictive parts of the clause, which will still have damaging consequences for tenants in the circumstances to which I referred earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In so far as the Minister has clarified the position with regard to the increased protection given to new assured tenancies—moving them out of part VII—I welcome what he has said. However, I still have grave doubts about the impact of the earlier parts of the clause. The amendment has served its purpose. We shall consider the Minister's speech and draw our conclusions in due course. However, one or two matters will require clarification before we withdraw the amendment, if, indeed, that is what we decide to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I get the impression that no one will lament the passing of the part VII contract phenomenon. The clause will improve the situation for a vulnerable group of people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One point that has not yet been clarified is whether sitting tenants who have their terms varied will be worse off. The Minister sought to slide out of answering that question by saying that tenancies with part VII contracts tended to be short-term, so that they would disappear off the scene before anyone knew what had happened. I remain anxious that there may be people—however few and for however short of period—who may find themselves in a trap because of what the clause provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister owes it to those people in
	<span class='label label-info column'>930</span>
Scotland—and to us—to give an explanation and undertaking that they will be no worse off in the interim period, however short it may be. Those people have more than enough problems already, and we should not be legislating to make things any worse for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister said, this is a long and complicated clause, designed to deal with the short-term phasing out of the part VII system and the phasing in of the new type of assured tenancies or short assured tenancies. If the parliamentary draftsman has drafted the clause to achieve that, we may as well make sure that it is right. It would be outrageous if any people in Scotland found themselves significantly worse off, or in a position to be exploited or abused by their landlords, because of sloppy consideration by the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the Minister's point that this is a short-term question, and the principle that clause 41 is a step in the right direciton. Any improvement in the position of those people must be useful. We have already debated assured tenancies and short assured tenancies. Whether or not they are good, they are infinitely more desirable than what currently confronts that category of people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will anyone lose out on any existing rights, for however short a period, as a result of phasing arrangements in the clause as it stands? If so, why, and is the Minister prepared to do anything about it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not a lawyer, so perhaps I am in the minority in Parliament. However, I understand from the Minister that the object of clause 41 is to phase out part VII contract holders. That will be achieved by tenants holding such contracts agreeing the variation in tenancy with the landlords, which will then be construed as new assured tenancies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there will be circumstances in which an agreement on variation will not be sufficient to be considered as a new assured tenancy. The Minister specifically mentioned a variation in rent which resulted from referral to a rent assessment committee. Will he explain in detail what will happen to part VII contract holders who agree to a variation in rent after it has been referred to such a committee? Will they continue as part VII contract holders? How will they be phased out, and what will happen to them? Will he give me an assurance about the exceptions who will not move from holding part VII contracts to assured tenancies? What will happen to them? How long will they be in that position? Will they be in a weaker or stronger position as a result of the clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will mean that the part VII contract will continue in that case, it is a somewhat technical point, so I must make the position clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) asked if those concerned would be worse off. Clearly, a few would be for a short time, until they obtained assured tenancies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Existing part VII contract holders with resident landlords who obtain new contracts will, as a rule, lose the protection of part VII under their new contract. It will be a question of whether variation of the terms of their contract creates a new contract and if so, whether that will be an assured tenancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That sums up the position. Perhaps I may answer any further questions during the debate on clause stand part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has answered a fundamental question very honestly. He has acknowledged that some people, for a short period, will be worse off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is fair to say that that was not the Minister's intention when he embarked on this course. The clause was probably originally conceived to take the group of people a little further forward; the minister did not intend to leave anyone by the wayside. However, we have established that for a certain amount of time a smallish group of people could lose the limited protection that exists at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I am being excessively generous to the Under-Secretary of State. I suspect that if he were to use the ingenuity of parliamentary draftsmen, solicitors and so on to find a way to amend that shortcoming in clause 41, such an endeavour might find universal support. Will he do that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister will also give us an idea of who will suffer, how many there will be and for how long they will suffer? Will he give us an idea of the criteria that will apply to variations in agreement between the landlords and tenants under part VII contracts which will justify the granting of new assured tenancy contracts? He has said that there will be variations under which new assured contracts will come into place, but that there will be exceptions. What will be the criteria for granting new assured tenancies?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition are leading on to clause stand part. If they wish to debate clause stand part with amendment No. 479 I am happy to do that. They are obviously worried about the principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is inevitable that, if part VII contracts are to be abolished, some people who do not have tenancies and who have resident landlords will be temporarily worse off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 41 provides that, after the coming into force of the clause, new contracts for occupancy which are not tenancies will not be part VII contracts under the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984, except in very limited circumstances, Part VII contracts at present are an agreement to grant a right of occupation which is not
	<span class='label label-info column'>932</span>
given in circumstances which allow the agreement to be considered as a protected tenancy. In practice, they are nowadays mostly lets by resident landlords, on a payment which includes some charge for services or for the use of furniture. The difficulty is that the boundary between part VII contracts and ordinary protected tenancies has proved a difficult one to draw in practice; it is the Government's view that the complex provisions which surround them will in any case no longer be necessary with the introduction of the new regime. Under the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984, a letting was excluded from being a protected tenancy if the rent included payments in respect of board or attendance. This has proved a fruitful area for attempted evasion and abuse. Under the provisions of the Bill, there will be no test relating to the inclusion or not of board or attendance in the Rent. If the contract is a tenancy for which a Rent would have to be paid, subject to the exceptions in schedule 4, it is either an assured tenancy or a short assured tenancy. Therefore, there is no longer any place for part VII contracts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the substance of clause 41, and the remaining provisions are largely technical ones consequential on that central concept. The main points are that a new part VII contract can be created if that is done in pursuance of a former contract. But, if there is a change in the Rent, unless that variation is the result of a reference to the Rent Assessment Committee, a new contract will be deemed to have been created, and it will be a question of fact whether that new contract is an assured tenancy. In any event, the uncertainty and confusion which now surrounds part VII contracts will be removed and replaced by a system which is much easier to understand, especially for tenants. I therefore commend the clause to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that some part VII tenants would be temporarily worse off. What does he mean by worse off? What would those tenants lose? How temporary is temporarily?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously it depends on the circumstances. The only disadvantaged group appears to be part VII contract tenants who have not had their rent registered and have therefore not taken advantage of the protection provided by part VII. A part VII contract holder will retain the right to seek a registered rent even after the

	<span class='label label-info column'>933</span>
Bill's commencement. If he takes advantage of that right he will not lose out, but if he does not it is in the amount of rent that he pays that he will lose out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If, under your guidance, Mr. Lambie, we are taking another look at the amendment and how it relates to the clause, I should like to take another bite at the cherry and consider the place that part VII contracts have played over the past few years in the private rented sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that there had been some abuse, and that there is potential for abuse under part VII contracts. That works both ways; it is my experience that some tenants have been exploited under part VII contracts. What potential abuse does the Minister foresee? I am not sure that the clause will remove it. I understood the honourable Gentleman to say that this is a transitional provision, and that part VII contracts will still be allowed under clause 41.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister is so worried about cases where the tenant shares residency with a landlord and has a contract with him, why has he not taken a more radical step and done away with part VII contracts and brought forward a new provision to avoid the abuses? He seemed to be saying that part VII contracts have potential for abuse, yet allowing them to continue, albeit in more limited circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister owes the Committee more detailed information about the abuses. Anyway, I am not sure that the clause will prevent abuses and that the Government will achieve the end that they seek. Moreover, if part VII contracts continue, what will happen to tenants who have suffered exploitation, as some have, under part VII contracts?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are simpler ways of achieving the Government's aims than what is proposed in much of the Bill, and clause 41 is a prime example of that. It would be possible, and preferable, to erect a statutory framework, and then allow the courts discretion to interpret it. Courts in areas with a high level of private sector renting can quickly come to terms with the outline of legislation and, using precedents and established and reported cases, build up a body of law that makes sense in a way that cannot be provided easily in statute. There are not so many part VII contracts in rural Scotland—there are many more in the central industrial belt—so I have not had much experience of them. I believe that trying to set up a statutory detailed labyrinthine framework is a difficult method of dealing with any of these matters, and particularly part VII contracts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister say more about the abuses by both landlords and tenants that he is trying to stop? Will he consider what role the part VII contracts will continue to play in the new regime? He seemed to suggest that he would like to see the back of them. If that were true, perhaps he should introduce legislation that would achieve that aim. What will be the impact of the clause in the new regime?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause provides that no part VII contracts—generally made
	<span class='label label-info column'>934</span>
for furnished lettings—will be created after the legislation is enacted. That is clearly stated in subsection (1). Our fundamental objection to the contracts is that they are complex and difficult to define. We do not know exactly how many tenants are involved but, as the honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire said, there are very few. The number of references to the rent assessment committee totals about 30 or 40 a year. Part VII contracts will continue in effect only if tenants wish them to do so. In those circumstances, we shall have to assume that the tenants are content with the arrangement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it really beyond the capacity of the Government to require that if a part VII contract were identified as less of a benefit to a tenant an assured tenancy should apply? What is wrong with providing betterment for tenants in such straitened circumstances?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said, if a part VII contract were to continue, we must assume that the tenant had been happy with the arrangement laid down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Doran 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) made a valid point, which the Minister did not pick up. I understand that no part VII contract can be made after the Bill comes into force. The Minister described the measure as transitional, but I do not regard it as such. It will wipe out the whole concept of part VII contracts. Although I do not disagree with that, I object to the legislation being cluttered up with such a half-baked measure. It does not really meet the objective that the Government seem to be seeking to achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier, the Minister said that the majority of part VII contracts were temporary arrangements. The honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire asked why the Government did not simply abolish them rather than clutter up the legislation with an obscure and complicated measure that does not mean anything to anyone. If that were the Government's intention, why do they not have the courage to introduce specific measures that would provide for that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Bill, the people who will have to interpret and apply the provision will be even more confused about what is required and what is intended. For example, what will happen to existing tenancies? It would not be beyond the Government's grasp to make a clear statement about how they should be treated. Then everyone would be much happier and more clear about the Bill's intention. The Minister must have the courage of his convictions and introduce some decent legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have the courage of my convictions. The honourable Gentleman asked why we do not abolish part VII contracts. We have done that in a way that would avoid unnecessarily disturbing the existing arrangements. The clause makes transitional arrangements on the road to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0592">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>935</span>
achieving complete abolition. Part VII contracts could not be made into assured tenancies, because they might not be tenancies in the first place. They would be assured tenancies if they met the general criteria. The difficulty with them is that they are not clearly defined. There are very few of them and, as I said, few references are made to the rent assessment committee. Therefore, it is necessary to make adequate transitional arrangements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said earlier, we shall not be unhappy about the passing of the phenomenon of the part VII contract. The term "contract" implies that the arrangement is not a lease. It is a device not so freely entered into by a tenant, whereby the landlord is providing services or furniture so that he can avoid the normal obligations to a tenant that would apply under a lease.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee is probably unanimous in not being sorry to see the back of that lot. The provision will remove part VII from the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984, which will mean that about 10 or 20 statutes will go up in smoke. That is not a bad thing. I am sure that the honourable and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn) will enthuse about the idea of a large quantity of statute law going into the bin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have now strayed into the clause stand part debate, but the objective of our amendment is to probe why subsections (2), (3), (4) and (5) are contained in the clause. They amount to half a page of legislation. Subsection (1) will achieve the Government's aim of abolishing part VII contracts—so far, so good—but no one really understands the purpose of the other subsections. We assumed that they were in the Bill to achieve some constructive transitional progress to deal with overlapping problems when people held existing part VII contracts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We began by asking whether anyone would be worse off because of the provisions. The Minister said candidly that a small group of people will be worse off and would lose their existing rights and protections. With uncharacteristic generosity to the Minister, I must say that I am sure that that was not his intention. There must be ways in which that problem can be overcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are getting bogged down in a fairly minor provision in the Bill, although we are discussing a category of people who do not receive much consideration in Scotland. People living in shared or furnished accommodation in the twilight area of the part VII contract have rather rough lives. We should not be passing legislation that will make their lives worse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We support the Minister's decision to get rid of part VII contracts. He will elevate the position of people in that tenure into something that will be marginally more secure. Assured tenancies will be a little better than the system in which they are presently trapped. But what about the tiny handful of people who have existing part VII contracts who will lose their protection? No doubt it will emerge in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>936</span>
future that some people have been flung out on the streets because of the unsatisfactory way in which the transition was dealt with. The amendment would overcome that problem. It seeks to lift out all the junk after subsection (1), abolish the part VII system and bring the contracts into the assured tenancy system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Everyone can understand the Minister when he says that he is seeking to bring in a system that will be as easily understood by tenants as by members of the Committee. We would also welcome any attempt to make it impossible for landlords to try to evade the protections that exist under part VII contracts by requiring tenants to make payments for board, and so on. We welcome the fact that we are moving away from that, towards a system of assured contracts. That represents a strengthening of the tenants' position in relation to the landlord. There is no argument about that. The argument concerns the way in which the Government hope to achieve that, and how they intend to eliminate part VII contracts and replace them with assured contracts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that in the fullness of time part VII contracts will disappear, but that where they still exist tenants under them will have the right to have their rents registered. He admits that that is unrealistic, because very few tenants in that position attempt to have their rents registered or referred to a rent assessment committee. When asked who would be the likely losers in the transitional period, when we move away from part VII contracts to assured tenancies, he said that it would be those who had not sought to have their rents registered and those who have resident landlords. The Minister also mentioned, in that context, those who do not have tenancy agreements and those who make payments for board under part VII contracts. That is the group that everyone is concerned about. The Minister has given no indication that the Government are doing anything to protect them. Instead, it appears that the most vulnerable group of tenants in Scotland at present will be left to the mercy of the landlords. What does the Minister intend to do about them? What protection will they be given? Are the Minister and the Government prepared to leave that group completely unprotected and at the mercy of the landlords? The Minister must consider that central point before we leave this debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are a number of points that I should like to answer. First, to what extent would those concerned be worse off? They would be worse off because they would lose the right to go to the rent assessment committee. If they are tenants they will become assured tenants if their contract comes to an end. All part VII contract holders, whatever happens to their contracts, will continue to be protected against harassment and illegal eviction under the terms of the Bill. The problem is that this category is so difficult to define, and so some clarification of the law was required.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0593">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>937</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These provisions have been in force for many years. Although rent assessment committees have only 30 or 40 references a year, they have been able to sort out in technical and legal terms what a part VII contract is and what an abuse is. To expect the clause to improve the situation is a pipe dream. A point that was touched on earlier by a number of honourable Members, including myself, but was crystallised a moment ago by the honourable Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson), was the question whether part VII contract holders could be given wholesale new rights. Why cannot they all be made assured tenancies, de novo, as of the implementation of the Act?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am thinking on my feet, which one should never do in Committe, but I suppose that the only objection to that is that there would be an element of retrospective legislation. When the landlord entered into the part VII contract he would have been aware of his liabilities and obligations. It would be slightly unfair to wish upon him a new regime later in the year. On the other hand, if the Minister is arguing that part VII contracts are open to abuse, and if there is only a small number of cases, we would be dealing with only a small number of people. Creating assured tenancies out of part VII contracts would in all equity be a perfectly justifiable move to make. We had enough discussion about it in the earlier stages of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Assured tenancies are not particularly onerous for landlords anyway, albeit that they are resident landlords. What consideration was given to the option of making all part VII contracts assured tenancies from day 1 after the implementation of the Act?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some of those concerned are tenants and some are not. There is much vagueness, and there are problems with the definition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect to the Minister, there is no difficulty in imposing a regime whereby they all become assured tenancies. I understand what the Minister is saying. He is saying that there is a question of interpretation under existing legislation, but if we sweep all that away they are made tenants de novo. Therefore, there is no longer any doubt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They will become assured tenants if their contracts come to an end.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a big "if".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously honourable Members are concerned about the question whether people will exercise their rights. We cannot legislate to make sure that people do so. We can only inform those concerned of their rights and hope that they will exercise them. I inquired whether there had been representations on this point arising out of consultation. There were none. There were no representations about the abolition of part VII contracts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that he was nodding his head when I said that the group of
	<span class='label label-info column'>938</span>
losers would be those with resident landlords, those with no tenancy agreements, those who pay board at present, and so on? As I understand it, those people have some protection at present under part VII contracts. The Minister said that although they would lose those rights in the transitional period they would have some kind of protection from illegal eviction and harassment under the provisions of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those who pay board would be better off, because they would be assured tenants. This is a complicated matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: People without assured tenancies would lose whatever protection they have under part VII contracts. I want the Minister to consider their position. He said that they will have protection from illegal eviction and harassment under earlier clauses in the Bill, but to get that protection they will have to be sufficiently equipped to take their landlords to court to sue for damages for illegal eviction or harassment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister admits that this is the same group who usually are not well enough equipped to have their rent registered and to appeal to rent assessment committees. If that is the case it is unlikely that they will be able to avail themselves of the protection under the Bill and take their landlord to court. The Minister is washing his hands of this group. He is prepared to leave them at the mercy of their landlords. They will continue to be exploited as they have been in the past; the Government are not prepared to do anything about it. At least, that is how I interpret the Minister's earlier answer to me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps my honourable Friend is being a wee bit harsh on the Minister. I understood him to say, in reply to the honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood), that one of these tenancies would become an assured tenancy. I am interested in the mechanics of that. We had a long debate on the terms of clause 14 and the rights of individuals in multiple occupancy residences. The Minister clearly said that the Government did not intend to allow them to have assured tenancies. I am interested to know how part VII tenancies will become assured tenancies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot add much more. They would become assured tenancies if the part VII tenancies came to an end, but they would have to be tenants in the first place. Part of the problem with part VII contracts is that some are tenants and some are not. The circumstances are vague, and there are problems of definition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed.</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be useful if the Minister could speak about the clause, as it seems to have considerable significance. It implies that existing tenancies that are transferred from the public or housing association sector to the private sector will become assured tenancies. That implies that where transfers from the public sector to housing associations take place an assured tenancy will exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have discussed the principle of assured tenancies, and much has been said about the prospects of tenants who are unwillingly transferred from the public to the private sector, and the way in which that will affect their tenure, rent structure and security. It would be wrong if such a significant clause were to go through on the nod.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister explain the precise circumstances under which those transfers can take place? We seek to defend the fact that people who are transferred to another landlord while remaining in the same house will be automatically inserted into a different type of tenancy system, which may be less advantageous for them. We do not like that principle, and the Government should at least have the courage to explain what they are doing before we proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although the clause fills more than a page, its essential purpose is simple. It explains what will happen when tenants with public sector or housing association tenancies transfer to a different landlord after the Bill comes into effect. Any such tenant will be obliged to take an assured tenancy unless he or she is a secure tenant who transfers to a public sector landlord or to Scottish Homes. Only in that excluded circumstance can the tenant transfer on secure tenancy terms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is clearly connected to part III, which we shall debate presently. Much will then be made of the fact that the Government are keen that people should transfer from the public to the private sector but will not allow people to do the reverse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not like the principle of assured or short assured tenancies, and I cannot see the justification for compelling tenants, who are transferred between sectors, for whatever reason, to forfeit their rights to the type of secure tenancy that now exists in the public sector. Tenants who exercise that right will be taking a severe risk, and we shall highlight that when we debate part III. Tenants should be warned of the risks that they are taking when the private sector approach public sector tenants who live in attractive
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0595">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>941</span>
housing, which looks as though it will rise in value. Entrepreneurs will try to entice tenants to activate the procedures under part III. It must be made extremely clear to tenants that, if they activate such a process, they will be signing away some important rights that they presently enjoy. That sort of transfer should carry a health warning to inform tenants that they will be worse off—that they are tearing up the security of tenure that they have in the public sector and facing the prospect of rapidly escalating rents. Although there may be superficial attractions in the short term, because of the framework of finances in housing, there are many other aspects that will be extremely unattractive. I do not like the format that the Government are devising, and I am minded to vote against the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My honourable Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) is right to point out that this is a prelude to the debates that we shall have on part III. The Minister says that it is fundamental, but it does not stop our expressing our disquiet and unease about the measure that is about to be unleashed on the Scottish public. My honourable Friend referred to the very valuable rights that tenants will lose if they decide, or are persuaded, to transfer. We shall see a change in the housing market. We can make jokes about insurance and encyclopaedia salesmen and Avon ladies, but when landlords in Scotland get round to persuading tenants in public authority houses to sign away their rights we shall see a completely different scale of operation. There will be substantial pickings for landlords. That will be presaged by a huge campaign to persuade tenants that there is nothing to be gained by staying with the public authority landlord and there will be a bright new tomorrow if they come to "Housing Scotland Incorporated" or "Friendly Landlords Ltd".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What sort of largesse will be shown to those tenants? The system will be wide open to abuse, and at the end of the day neither the landlords nor the Government will lose, but local authorities will. I am not suggesting that all local authority houses are perfect and that there should not be improvements in the management of the housing stock but, above all, tenants will lose under the new system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have probably bored the Minister by listing the rights that tenants will lose, but I shall continue to spell out the valuable rights that will be lost by tenants in public rented housing who choose that path. They will lose their rights to a written lease. The Minister is taking a wee look at that. At present, tenants are given a written lease by the local authority or housing association, but private landlords will not have to do that. Tenants will lose their right to attend meetings of the local authority. That is an importnat right, especially at this time of the year, when most local authorities are striking new rents. New rents are discussed publicly and tenants can make their feelings known, so that the local authority can take those views into account. That is an important right that will not be given by a private landlord.

Tenants who transfer will lose their right to buy.

	<span class='label label-info column'>942</span>
The Tenants' Rights etc. (Scotland) Act 1980 was a significant measure. I do not agree with the sale of public rented housing, but it has been popular. I wonder how popular it will be for landlords to sell the idea that tenants will lose their right to buy. I do not know why public authority tenants are given that grand and wonderful right while it is denied to those in the private rented sector. Of course, I do understand but I do not accept that philosophy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tenants will lose the significant right to a phasing of rent increase. They will lose their right to protected or secured tenancy. I cannot understand why that should be taken away from tenants. If a landlord wants to take over a particular property, why does he not take that as a package, including the rights that tenants have? He could then calculate the benefit of that investment. But that will not happen. Tenants' rights will be diluted and the secured tenancy right will be taken away. I do not understand why landlords should be given the privilege of watering down tenants' rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I want to buy a stereo or a car, I know the terms and the performance to expect. If I want shares in a company, I know what I am buying. But landlords will be given privileges that would be undreamed of in any market place. Why is it necessary to remove the rights of tenants? We have already debated tacit relocation as originally intended by the Government, but that concept has been torn up. The Minister said that he will think about that, and I am delighted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Protection from eviction will be part and parcel of the loss of secured tenancy rights, and that will be removed. Tenants will have far fewer rights than protected or secure tenants. The Government are so keen to help landlords that they are taking away the right of discretion in the courts. They do not trust the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, there are clear, specific and civilised rights of succession. The Government are asking tenants to vote to tear up that right. Schedule 5 will put inhumane pressure on spouses of deceased loved ones. That will be a mandatory ground for removal if a tenancy is devolved under intestacy. I cannot understand why that crude element of the market place should be brought into such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am intrigued to know how the Government will set about the publicity. We have spent much time criticising the White Paper and the blandness with which its plans were presented. Tenants have not been told that they will lose all those rights. I have referred to only a few of the more important ones, but there are others. Will Scottish Office circulars be delivered to every household telling tenants of a wonderful new dawn that awaits them? What will the Government do to control landlords' attempts to persuade tenants to transfer?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a landlord is faced with the prospect of persuading tenants that he wants to take over a large housing scheme, what is to stop his paying tenants to vote in a particular way? Many people will not be able to resist the short-term temptation. There will be a potentially huge profit for landlords. We have already seen property developers moving into our city centre housing schemes in Edinburgh and Glasgow on a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0596">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>943</span>
grand scale. What controls will the Government place on such activities and the unscrupulous landlords who send "rent collectors" who are nothing more than thugs, into the streets to see what they can do to persuade tenants to choose a landlord? Those matters cause anxiety to Opposition Members, but the Government seem to be ignoring that in the rush to bring commercialism and profit into the housing market, especially the private rented sector. </div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Lambie. Clause 42(4)(c) refers to the New Town (Scotland) Act 1969.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) anticipated the lengthy debates that we shall have on part III, and we can discuss rights of tenants thoroughly then. He referred to phasing of rent in the public sector, but to my knowledge there is no such phasing. We are considering the right to a written lease. The honourable Member knows that the right to buy is not included for future housing association tenants, because we want to introduce private finance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister must know that it is not uncommon for local authorities to set ceilings on the level of a rent increase.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not the same as phasing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no element of compulsion in the clause. Transfers would take place only if tenants agreed and accepted the new terms on which they were to move. The honourable Member for Aberdeen, South asked about publicity. We envisage that Scottish Homes will have a part to play, and clause 2(2)(q) covers that matter, so there are sufficient powers in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause applies to the assured tenancies for tenants of public authorities and housing associations, who transfer to a landlord other than a public sector landlord. I commend the clause to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the debate and I am puzzled by subsection (3)(b). My initial reaction to clause 42 was that it did not sit easily in that part of the Bill. It is in the index of clauses headed, "Phasing out of Rent (Scotland) Act 1984 and other transitional provisions". I cannot see how that applies to clause 42. I should have thought that another part of the Bill would have been more appropriate in which to insert the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried about subsection (3)(b) and should be grateful if the Minister would clarify how that subsection will work. The notes on clauses state:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Subsection 3(b) provides that at the time of transfer the tenancy shall not be capable of being a secure tenancy unless the interests of the landlord are transferred then, or at some future date, to another public body; and provides that in such a case the tenancy may only be regarded as a secure tenancy when such a transfer of landlord interest is effected."</p></blockquote>
I have been trying to work out how that would operate in practice. There may be a blindingly simple answer. There must be, judging by the look of consternation that has just passed across the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0597">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>945</span>
Minister's face. No doubt, I shall be given a crystal clear explanation. He might tell us why clause 42 has found its way into that part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That subsection means exactly what the honourable Gentleman read to the Committee. For example, if an SSHA or a local authority tenant becomes a tenant of Scottish Homes, when the legal procedures have been completed there will be security of tenure, as there will be for any tenant who transfers to Scottish Homes. The subsection may be rather convoluted, but that is the position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Management co-operatives remain secure tenants because the landlord is the public authority landlord. Ownership co-ops will become assured tenants because they are tenants of private sector landlords.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may be getting dull in the head, but subsection (3)(b) suggests to me that there is provision for a transfer to a public body. I understand that the definition of public body relates to islands and district councils. Perhaps I am missing something, but that suggests to me that the transfer could be effected. I understand the Minister's example in relation to Scottish Homes, but clause 42 suggests to me that it is possible to move into the public sector because tenancy is mentioned in subsection (3)(b) in terms of transferring to a public body. Public bodies are defined under subsection (4) as including islands and district councils. I must have it wrong, although I do not understand how. Will the Minister please explain why it is not possible to go back from a private tenancy to a local authority as subsection (3)(b) stands?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not the general thrust of the legislation to enable local authority tenants to transfer from one local authority to another, but there may be circumstances in which public sector tenants in, for example, remote areas of Scotland, might decide that they wish to transfer and the receiving public landlord might be happy to accept them. If everyone agreed, I can envisage circumstances in which the Secretary of State could have powers to make arrangements accordingly. That is not the general thrust of the legislation, but I accept that the possibility may exist in exceptional circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The plot thickens.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, as the honourable Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) said, the plot thickens. I still think that I am missing something. It will hit me, I am sure, sooner or later. I understand what the Minister said, but am I right in thinking now that it is possible for a tenancy to be transferred into the public sector under clause 42(3)(b)? I believe that the Minister was saying a few moments ago that in rural authorities, in certain circumstances—with the Secretary of State somewhere in the background—it might be possible for a tenancy to be transferred from local authority to local authority. If that is the case, I
	<span class='label label-info column'>946</span>
am surprised. I understand that it is not the general thrust of the legislation, but I thought that part of the legislation was designed to preclude precisely that possibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have it in my head, grumbling away, that clause 42(3)(b) would allow a tenancy to transfer into an island or a district authority. If that is not so, I hope that the Minister, the honourable Member for East Lothian, or anyone, will put me right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There can be transfers to local authorities under the powers of transfer other than under tenants' choice under section 12(7) of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987, with the consent of the Secretary of State. As I said, it is not the general thrust of this legislation, but clause 42 covers all possible circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I give up. </div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not surprised that the honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) said that he gives up. We know too well what is the general thrust of the legislation. It seeks to force, cajole or otherwise press people out of the public sector into private sector tenancies, regardless of the risk to them in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire was being unduly optimistic about the implications of subsection (3)(b) in thinking that it might create propects for public sector tenants who are paying excessive rents in Berwickshire to opt to become tenants of East Lothian district council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They could not afford the rates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They would not have to pay the rates to the Lothian region, only the rent. It is an intriguing thought and there are possibilities in the idea of extending public sector employers, as well as Quality Street employers, around the county. I do not believe, as the Minister said, that that is the thrust of what the Government are trying to do. They are trying first to get people to transfer from local authorities to Scottish Homes—that is what the subsection is about—and in due course Scottish Homes will use its powers of persuasion to—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does not say that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does—I do not want to do the Minister's job for him—because subsection (4) refers not only to district and island councils but in subsection 4(e) to Scottish Homes, too. The proposal seeks to build up the Scottish Homes empire with a view to moving people to the private sector, but it is not my job to explain the wretched Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not hear the Minister respond to my question about the standing of co-ops—perhaps I was temporarily distracted when he answered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did answer the question about co-ops. Ownership co-ops are private
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0598">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>947</span>
landlords and therefore assured tenancies. In other co-ops, because the landlord will remain the public authority, they will remain secure tenants. Clause 42 does not actually allow any transfers. It states what will happen if transfers occur. Transfers need not be to local authorities. There are many more public sector landlords.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for repeating what he said about co-ops. I must have been temporarily distracted because I did not hear his first explanation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have probably flogged this point hard enough and we are unlikely to get any more information out of the Minister in the debate on clause 42. It is part of a strategy which we do not like. We do not like the fact that there will be two separate categories of tenancy, the secure tenancy in the public sector and the plainly insecure tenancy in the private sector. We do not wish people to move to the insecure tenancy which the Government are cooking up and which others will try to entice them into in due course. We are worried about the trap being set for tenants in Scotland. I do not support the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>STATUTORY TENANTS SUCCESSION 1984C. 58</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 465, in page 28, line 10, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(1A) Where the original tenant dies and the interest of the landlord belongs to a registered housing association, the tenancy shall pass by operation of law to a qualified person in accordance with section 52 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987. References in that Act to a secure tenancy are, for the purposes of this section, references to an assured tenancy under which the interest of the landlord belongs to a registered housing association".</p></blockquote>
We come now to an important part of the Bill, which deals with the question of succession. The amendment seeks to ensure that, were registered housing associations have granted assured tenancies, the right to succession that now applies to housing associations tenancies is preserved. It is not unreasonable to seek to do that. I am not aware that rights of succession have created problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 43 amends provisions in the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984 for succession to statutory tenancies. I understand that housing association tenants enjoy security of tenure under part III of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987. Section 52 of that Act
	<span class='label label-info column'>948</span>
provides for a qualified person—a spouse or a close relative—to succeed to a secure tenancy in the event of the death of the original tenant provided that the succeeding tenant has lived in that house for a 12-month period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to preserve that right of succession as it applies to tenancies of registered housing associations for assured tenancies granted by housing associations. In its response to the consultation paper "Housing: The Government's Proposals for Scotland" the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations expressed its belief in the maintenance of existing tenants' rights and its regret that housing associations were to be treated as private landlords. I am sure that the Minister is aware of that. It also expressed the view that housing associations, which are non-profit making and mostly caring landlords, would wish to continue operating in accordance with the spirit of the tenants' charter as it applied to succession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill amends the provision of the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984 for the right of succession to statutory tenancies. The 1984 Act does not apply to housing association tenancies. Therefore, the Bill would result in the rights of future housing association tenants being determined by legislation originally aimed at the private rented sector, which is substantially different from that which determines the rights of existing housing association tenants. In extending the qualifying period of residence from 12 months to five years, the Bill would seriously restrict the right of succession for future tenants of registered housing associations. The Scottish Federation of Housing Associations advised me that it believes that to be a retrograde step. I am sure that the reasons are obvious to the Committee. The federation reiterates the view that it expressed in its response to the consultation paper, that existing rules should be maintained and improved, not reduced in the manner proposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I seek to ensure that assured tenancies granted to registered housing associations are subject to the same law of succession that applies to existing housing association tenancies. It is intended that a spouse or a close relative should be able to succeed to an assured tenancy provided that he had lived with the tenant for the previous 12 months, and that when an existing secure tenant died and was succeeded by someone other than a spouse, that person should succeed to a secure tenancy rather than an assured tenancy as proposed in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is the first to deal with those clauses relating to succession. Housing associations are firmly and collectively of the view that they wish to stick by the existing rules and regulations on succession. They are positively pursuing the interests of their tenants in doing so. I hope that the Committee will consider the amendment in the positive light in which the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations has put it forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the debate on clause 40, I spoke of the discussions that are to take place on Monday 19 February between officials of the Scottish Development Department, the Scottish
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0599">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>949</span>
Federation of Housing Associations and the Housing Corporation in Scotland. They will be examining the relationship between the assured tenancy that housing associations need in order to take full advantage of future opportunities and the rights conferred on tenants under part III of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) is well aware, those rights include some rights of succession. They will be fully discussed at that meeting. The Committee has already accepted that such discussions are the best way forward. If those discussions lead to a requirement for the Bill to be further amended, that can be done at a later stage. I hope that the honourable Gentleman will seek to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised and taken aback. I understood the Minister to say that the discussions will embrace the question of succession as well as other matters that were agreed. Well, fancy that! I am surprised. Of course, I am happy to accept that assurance. The discussions take place on 29 February; on 30 February—if 30 days there were—the Minister will come hot foot to table the appropriate words so that we can consider how the meeting went, what agreement had been reached and what amendments were necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other members of the Committee may wish to take matters further now. Perhaps we shall return to the question of succession in other parts of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The date 29 February is unusual; 30 February is even more unusual. I hope that it will be an auspicious day for the shoot-out between the Minister and the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations. We wish the meeting well. The Minister has built a pretty stiff agenda for the meeting. He has now extended it to discuss the succession of tenancies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to associate myself and my honourable Friends with the principle of the amendment moved by the honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood). The amendment was drafted by the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations, which has been doing rather well in the Committee. It has applied some formidable pressure to the Scottish Office and several of the concessions that have been clocked up so far have been made in response to its representations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Succession is an important principle. On reading the Bill, I was worried about the substantial increase in the qualifying period for the right to succeed to a tenancy from six months to five years. That could exclude numerous family members who may not have been living with the tenant for as long as five years. The change in the qualifying period could adversely affect a number of households.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
7 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has shown that there are prospects for another change of heart by the Government. We welcome that, and look forward to hearing the
	<span class='label label-info column'>950</span>
outcome of the important meeting on 29 February, even if it leads to another set of amendments being tabled on Report. I hope that the Government Whip, the honourable Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean) is keeping a tally of the concessions and Government amendments as well as Opposition amendments that will be tabled on Report. I hope that he has told the Government Chief Whip and the Leader of the House that we shall need several days to consider the Bill on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, so far, so good! I welcome the Minister's undertaking to consider that aspect of the Bill. I hope that we shall be able to protect the families of tenants in housing association property. In the clause stand part debate similar points could be made about other tenants whose rights of succession may be eroded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might benefit the Committee if you would guide us, Mr. Lambie. I do not know if you wish a short, general debate on succession to take place on the debate on clause stand part or on schedule 6.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) said that broader issues can be discussed later, but we cannot ask for more on housing associations now than the Minister has already conceded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister could say a word or two about the import of clause 43. I accept the point made by the honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) that we could deal with the details of succession when we discuss his amendments on schedule 6, and deal with the general principle after we have teased out the details whenever we discuss schedule 6 stand part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause is the vehicle for schedule 6, which amends the rules governing succession to protected tenancies under the rent (Scotland) Act 1984. The clause contains no substantive provision; but since this is our first opportunity to discuss the changes in succession detailed in schedule 6, I wish to explain why we consider that new succession rules are necessary and say how in broad terms, the new rules will differ from the presents rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government consider that the present succession rules are unfair to landlords who have to reckon with the possibility that a tenant will be succeeded by a spouse or another family member and that the first successor will, in turn, be succeeded by his or her spouse or relation. That extensive right to succession is bound to discourage many landlords or potential landlords from letting their property; and, of course, the main objective of part II of the Bill is to bring more rented accommodation on to the market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0600">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>951</span>
For assured tenancies created after the commencement of the legislation, no statutory right to succession will exist. However, that does not mean that a spouse or family member cannot succeed to an assured tenancy. A tenant can leave his tenancy in his will to a relative. Unless the landlord exercises his right to repossess under ground 9 of schedule 5 within a year of the death of the tenant, the inheritor will succeed to the assured tenancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For existing regulated tenancies, we do not propose to abolish the statutory right to succession. But schedule 6 seeks to modify the rules relating to succession by a family other than a spouse and those concerning second successions. No change will be made in the right of succession attaching to the spouse of an original regulated tenant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will no doubt wish to consider the proposed changes in greater detail when we debate schedule 6, but now I invite the Committee to agree that clause 43 stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister made it clear that no succession rights would apply to new tenancies that are created after the enactment of the Bill. Will tenancies that may transfer in terms of part III be regarded as new tenancies?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I explained earlier that, if a tenant transfers to the Scottish Homes or to a public sector authority, he will be a secure tenant holding the same rights as he holds under the legislation relating to public sector authority, he will be a secure tenant holding the same rights as he holds under the legislation relating to public sector tenants. I have undertaken to consider the matter of a tenant transferring to a housing association. If he transfers to another part of the private sector which is not a private sector landlord, for example a building society, the succession rights will be as stated in the schedule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I asked a specific question. Do the rights as stated in the schedule mean that the tenant's spouse and members of the tenant's family will have no right of succession?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If a joint tenancy has been entered into, member of the tenant's family would have equal rights of succession. The succession rules under tenant's choice will be those appropriate to the landlord to whom the tenant transfers. I accept that the arrangements offered by a landlord will determine whether a tenant wishes to transfer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish that the Minister would answer my question. I shall phrase it differently. Is the Minister saying that if a tenant, who is secure or protected, transfers to a private sector landlord out of the public sector, the tenant's spouse and anyone else who would be entitled to succeed, would lose the rights of ssuccession? Will the Minister answer yes or no?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>952</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the new tenancy is an assured tenancy, the tenant will have no succession rights.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the Committee want our remarks on this subject to be confined to schedule 6, but I have a general question about the types of representation that have been made on succession as dealt with in clause 43. The most contentious and distressing issues that emerges from representations made to me is the suggested change to succession rights in clause 43 and schedule 6. It would be helpful to the Committee if the Under-Secretary would say what the burden of representations was, where they came from, and what the conclusions were. I note that he has kindly put the representations in the Library. No doubt we shall all hurry there during the dinner break and do nothing but mug up on what has been said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Most of those who responded had varied views about succession. They are available in the Library and the honourable Member is welcome to study them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>AMENDMENTS OF SCHEDULE 1 TO RENT (SCOTLAND) ACT 1984</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 331, in page 60, leave out lines 27 to 32.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a probing amendment and I shall read out what it seeks to omit because other honourable Members must wonder what that means.
	<br><blockquote><p>"(3) If, immediately after the death of the original tenant, there is, by virtue of sub-paragraph (2) above, more than one person who fulfils the conditions in sub-paragraph (1) above, such one of them as may be decided by agreement or, in default of agreement, by the sheriff, shall be treated as the surviving spouse for the purposes of this paragraph."</p></blockquote>
I am sure that the miniser of my local kirk would be fascinated by that and I look forward to the explanation from my honourable Friend the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The issue raised by the honourable Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) is a Law Society of Scotland point and is valid. In the midst of my gloom when considering what this legislation will do to housing in Scotland, I am delighted by the progressive measures of paragraph 2(b) (2) and (3). They seem to give rights to co-habitees, which they previously did not have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a serious point in paragraph 2(b) (3) about giving guidance to the sheriff. For example, would it be appropriate for the sheriff to consider that, when different persons are included, the person who lives with the tenant should be given the right? Such guidance must be given to the sheriff, otherwise convoluted arguments will be presented to the court. The spouse who moved out of the house may have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0601">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>953</span>
lived in the house for longer than the co-habitee, or the co-habitee may have invested money in the house through furniture or decoration. The court will need some guidance when two people have a claim; and I urge the Minister to consider the Law Society brief on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer to the honourable Gentleman's question is yes. We are giving co-habitees rights for the first time. That prospect may encourage my honourable and learned Friend the Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn) to intervene. For many years the doctrine of marriage by cohabitation and repute has existed in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the English interfered, Scotland had the doctrine of cohabitation and repute as a manner of marriage. As far as I know, it was never part of Scottish law that if one was already married one could obtain a subsidiary spouse by cohabitation and repute, with the sheriff deciding who the spouse was.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The position in the old days was far from clear until it was formalised, as I respectfully suggest all marriages should be.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to my honourable Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) for raising this issue. Paragraph 2(b)(3) explains how a decision will be reached when more than one person appears to be entitled to succeed to a tenancy as the spouse of the deceased tenant. We hope that in most cases an agreement will be reached between those involved, but we accept that that will not always be possible and so we have allowed the sheriff to make that decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How the sheriff will reach that decision is best left to him and the court. Circumstances will vary so greatly from case to case that to try to lay down guidelines will lead to unfairness. I am sure that sheriffs can be trusted to use their good sense to reach fair and sensible decisions. I hope that my honourable Friend will seek to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I withdraw the amendment—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not yet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I decide to. My honourable Friend the Minister will be aware that a couple of weeks ago we were visited by representatives of the Church and Nation Committee. I wonder how the kirk would view our suggestion that it is in order to have a wife and a co-habitee who has some claim and entitlement. That seems to strike at the structure of the family unit, which is the basis of all that we think to be right and proper. We seem to be writing into law the suggestion that people should have co-habitees as well as wives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>954</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the first time that I have had reason to believe that there may be a streak of liberalism in the honourable Member for Tayside. North (Mr. Walker). [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I did not hear what my honourable Friend the Member for Dundee. East (Mr. McAllion) said, but I shall be happy to give way to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I merely pointed out that the honourable Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) may be speaking from experience in this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall leave that for now. I welcome the Government's intention to bring co-habitees within the legislation that provides for succession to tenancies. That must be a step in the right direction. However, the honourable Member for Tayside North, who moved the amendment in the absence of the honourable Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart), is worried about polygamous relationships. If the honourable Gentleman had looked at the brief provided by the Law Society of Scotland, he would have appreciated its anxiety over the dilemma facing sheriffs who will have to judge which member of the polygamous relationship should qualify to succeed to a tenancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Gentleman talked about the Church of Scotland. We live in a pluralist society in Scotland nowadays. Many Muslims now live there and so it can be perfectly legitimate for people to have polygamous marriages. But we should not pursue that issue now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister sought to resist our proposals for schedule 5 about the need to extend the discretion that sheriffs could exercise in judging the merits of eviction cases. That was in relation to part of the Act where the Government wanted there to be no doubt about the need to evict tenants, but this is a more complicated matter. The Government do not want to lay down guidelines and prefer to leave the poor old sheriffs to deal with sticky problems that may arise in relation to this aspect of the legislation. The Law Society of Scotland, which is as near as it is possible to get to a lawyers' trade union—I do not know whether sheriffs are among its members—suggests that that is not very fair to sheriffs and that there should be guidelines to help them to determine which cohabitee should be given the benefit of the doubt when deciding who should have the right to succeed to a tenancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In deference to my honourable Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran), I describe the Law Society of Scotland as an extremely eminent body. It got its amendments to us and has given us the benefit of its advice that something should be written into the Bill to provide guidance to sheriffs in Scotland on how to exercise their judgment in such cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We may be dealing with a minority. In an earlier debate it was said that there would be few cases, but there will be some and I have no doubt that they will be extremely complicated and that the sheriffs will be left to face the music. The Government owe it, to not only the individuals concerned but the Law Society and, heaven help us, the sheriffs who will be left to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0602">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>955</span>
deal with those cases, to clarify their intentions. As it is our job to legislate, we must make the intention of Parliament clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In my legal experience, I have encountered many odd circumstances and I am greatly worried by paragraphs 1 and 2 of schedule 6, especially by paragraph 2(b)(3), and how the sheriffs will apply the law. The Minister said that this provision is new in the law of Scotland and 1 congratulate him for pointing that out as we have long neglected the practicalities of some relationships. A cohabitee can sometimes be closer to someone than a wife or husband who has been away from the household for a long life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister was speaking, I was trying to think of examples from my experience of the sort of circumstances that we might consider. For example, I dealt with a case of a couple who had been separated for more than 24 years. I was acting for the wife and she had been cohabiting with someone for more than 20 of those years and had a brand new family. I would hope that in such a case when the wife had died a sheriff would find that her cohabitee was entitled to the house, but there is nothing in the Bill to suggest that that would be the case or to direct a sheriff in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can think of such arrangements as ménage-á-trois. How should a sheriff decide in such a case? There has been no mention of children but who should be responsible for them? For example, how should we deal with circumstances in which a marriage has broken up as a result of violence on the part of a spouse who has managed to stay in the home and has acquired a cohabitee? That cohabitee might be living in the residence but the injustice has been done to the long-suffering spouse who left it. There are many complex circumstances and I understand why the Government may shy away from putting down guidelines, but practicality suggests that some guidance should be given to the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am greatly worried at the prospect of such cases being left to sheriffs to deal with. That is not because I do not trust them, despite having heard sheriffs singing Orange songs, blasting off that they will refuse legal aid to miners and showing a certain element of prejudice, but because they are obliged to exercise their discretion within the parameters of the legislation that they are considering and other law which may apply such as the common law, for example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, sheriffs know the legal relationship between spouses. They understand that relationship and must deal with it but they are not so familiar with the concept of the cohabitee, except in a limited way and mainly in terms of the Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (Scotland) Act 1981. This is a relatively new area of law and I encourage the Minister to give serious thought to the points made by the Law Society of Scotland. Its observations have not been taken out of the air but are based on experience of the complexity of the human relationships with which courts have to deal and the fragility of those courts when they lack guidance. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>956</span>
Minister should reflect on the difficult period that the courts went through in applying the Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (Scotland) Act 1981. They had grave difficulty in applying that Act because it introduced new concepts and ideas and there were question marks over the drafting of parts of it which left much uncertainty. I repeat that the Minister should reflect seriously on the points made by the Law Society of Scotland as they are based on experience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This debate has made it clear that in considering complex human relationships it becomes increasingly difficult to arrive at what might have appeared to be fairly obvious answers at the beginning. That is why I may have seemed frivolous when I mentioned one or two matters earlier. However, my comments have produced the effect I expected them to have on Opposition members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make no criticism of Opposition Members for having drawn our attention to the difficulties arising out of the matters that we are debating. This area is almost uncharted. It is not difficult to define a spouse in terms of marriage or the common law in Scotland when people have lived together, but the relationships become complex if either partner or both are already married or had different arrangements that existed for a number of years. I am sure that all members of the Committee will have met women in their surgeries who are living with the third of their different fellows. The honourable Member for East Kilbride (Mr. Ingram) shakes his head, but I recommend that he should visit my surgery in Blairgowrie.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an earlier debate. I mentioned the people who come to pick berries in my constituency and some of them have the most unusual relationships. I do not understand some of their arrangements and I am certain that most of us would not commend them because of the problems that arise when children are involved. We should always bear in mind the problems of children that were mentioned by the honourable Member for Aberdeen. South (Mr. Doran).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to act and behave in accordance with the requirements of a civilised society which sets standards and values, we must at least bear in mind that children can result from or be involved in those unusual relationships, which leaves the state facing ghastly problems. When we legislate for the inheriting of leases, tenancies, and so on, ultimately someone has to make a judgment based on that legislation. I believe that the courts are the only places where those judgments should be made. Certainly, as a politician, I would not want to pass a judgment because if I were to do so I am sure that it would not be well received by Opposition Members. I believe that people who live together should be married for the sake of any children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
