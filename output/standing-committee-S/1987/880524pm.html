	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. McWilliam. When we adjourned I was about to attempt to answer the question of the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall), who was worried about the precise powers available to school boards on junior appointments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Boards will be unable to extend their roles in senior appointments, the procedure for which is set out in schedule 2. However, they will be able to take powers to make junior appointments, and the hon. Member for Dumbarton was right to point to the extent of those powers. In carrying out those functions, boards will be circumscribed by all the duties placed on them by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In granting a delegation order to boards to make junior appointments, it will be open to a local authority to attach any conditions that it considers relevant, including conditions relating to the planning of the deployment of staff, about which the hon. Gentleman was concerned. In any dispute about conditions it would be for the boards and for the Secretary of State to determine what was appropriate or desirable in individual circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my explanation clarifies the position, and I invite the Committee to agree that clause 15 should stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cumbernauld and Kilsyth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the absence of my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall), who I hope is on his way here at this very moment, I have to say that Opposition Members are profoundly unhappy with these powers which can be delegated to a school board. We have made it plain from the beginning that we have never been happy about them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the hon. Gentleman for intervening and I am grateful to him for giving way. I should have said that the hon. Member for Dumbarton told me that he had another commitment and that he apologised for the fact that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>522</span>
he would not be present to hear my response. I should have put his apology on record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 182, in page 18, line 25, after "Act", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Board shall be required to state its reasons for any such request, and".</p></blockquote>
The scope for such a request is wide and it is important for education authorities to give proper consideration to it and to place it in the context of the powers which need to be exercised by other school boards within an authority. That is an eminently sensible proposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment has its genesis within the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and it has the support of Opposition Members. The Minister should be able readily to agree to the amendment and I hope that he will do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to help the hon. Gentleman but it is difficult to do so. Schedule 3 sets out the framework for delegation of functions to boards. It rightly does not enumerate every possible exchange of correspondence and I would be surprised if the board did not state its reasons for wishing to take on a function when making a request. I would be still more surprised if the authority did not ask. Therefore, it is difficult to understand why the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth thinks that it is necessary to include the amendment in the Bill. Perhaps, on reflection, the hon. Gentleman may feel inclined to withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reason for moving the amendment is because we prefer the schedule to be watertight so that silly games cannot be played. That could happen by a board merely writing formally to the education authority asking for delegated powers in respect of X. To avoid that, and to ensure that boards understand that it is incumbent on them to make a proper case to education authorities when they are taking the serious step of seeking extra

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>523</span>
powers, we believe that the boards should be told that that is what is required by law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would seem that the Minister is not of a mind to accept the amendment. Accordingly, having made the point, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 183, in page 19, line 11, after "school", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"and having regard to the duty of the authority to operate within its budget and to run the whole education service efficiently".</p></blockquote>
The justification for the amendment is that the possibility exists that a complex pattern will arise within an authority with widely different powers being exercised by a variety of school boards, thereby making the keeping of records and the provision of information both complicated and expensive. That could place additional strain on the revenue budget, and the administration of the authority. It is for these reasons that we seek to include the amendment in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hope springs eternal, and I expect the Minister to accept the amendment, which is supported by COSLA. You, Mr. McWilliam, will be familiar with COSLA, although I think that particular organisation post-dates your service in local government, when you were the distinguished treasurer of Edinburgh corporation. COSLA has replaced the previous organisation that existed at the time of your local government service in Scotland, Mr. McWilliam, and it is now a widely respected institution that has a considerable input into all of our proceedings when we discuss any aspect of local government. I say that by way of explanation, Mr. McWilliam, now that you are in the Chair this afternoon. I hope that the Minister will accept amendment No. 183, which will enable us to move on to the next clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot accept amendment No. 183—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to disappoint the hon. Gentleman. His arguments in support of the amendment could be summarised as, "It would be administratively inconvenient for the education authority to have different boards with different levels of delegation." I take that to mean that the purpose of the amendment is to enable the Secretary of State to take a view about the level of administrative convenience for the education authority of differing levels of delegation among school boards. Yet, part of our aim is to encourage school boards to take appropriate powers unto themselves according to the wishes of the boards' members, as endorsed by the parents when appropriate. Therefore, the hon. Gentleman's arguments in support of amendment No. 183 run counter to the overall spirit and intention of the Bill. I regret that I am unable to help him and I must therefore ask him to withdraw the amendment. Alternatively, I must ask the Committee to reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to the Minister. Clearly, we shall not agree on the matter.

	<div class='title'>POWERS OF EDUCATION AUTHORITY TO ENSURE DUE EXERCISE OF DELEGATED FUNCTIONS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 178, in page 9, line 46, leave out "seriously or persistently".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 179, in page 10, line 14, leave out "gross".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause deals with the power of education authorities to suspend the delegation of a function in appropriate circumstances. In COSLA's view, the powers granted to the education authorities to ensure due exercise of delegated functions are inadequate. The terms used in subsection (2) relate to serious or persistent failure, to which amendment No. 178 relates. Subsection (4) refers to "gross mismanagement", to which amendment No. 179 relates. They are examples of lax standards and serious consideration should be given to the redrafting of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to COSLA and to the Opposition that it will be difficult to decide what constitutes serious or persistent failure or, indeed, "gross mismanagement". As the Bill is drafted, the decision appears to rest entirely with the education authority. If it is satisfied that there has been serious or persistent failure or "gross mismanagement", that is sufficient. But that is imprecise and perhaps contentious. Indeed, it would give an education authority a somewhat arbitrary power to use against the school boards. COSLA suggested that more appropriate provisions might be ones similar to those in section 70 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980. The authority would then have to be satisfied that the school board had
	<br><blockquote><p>"failed to discharge any duty imposed on them by or for the purposes of this Act".</p></blockquote>
If it were satisfied that such failure had occurred, an order could be made
	<br><blockquote><p>"declaring them to be in default in respect of that duty"</p></blockquote>
and requiring the school board
	<br><blockquote><p>"before a date stated in the order to discharge that duty."</p></blockquote>
That seems to be a more satisfactory approach to the problem. It is better than using terms such as "gross mismanagement" or serious and persistent failure, which seem contentious. That seems a more satisfactory way of approaching the problem. It is better than using such terms as "gross mismanagement" and "serious and persistent failure", which seem contentious and which make it

difficult to establish precisely when such irregularities occur.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot vary the system. The qualifications that the hon. Gentleman's amendment seek to remove are important. When a function has been delegated to a school board, there should be a presumption in favour of it being continued unless there is a risk to the performance of the education authority's obligations, functions and duties. If there were a failure, no matter how trivial, to comply with conditions of delegation, and this resulted in a suspension of delegation, the principle of delegation would be undermined. Similarly, if failure were to occur once, and once only, surely it would be unreasonable to argue that that in itself should be a ground for suspension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have provided that mismanagement should be a ground for suspension of delegation on immediate notice. We have said, however, that the mismanagement should be gross before immediate suspension is possible. That seems right and desirable. Why should there be immediate suspension for trivial circumstances and errors? It is evident from our discussions that the Opposition oppose the principle of delegation as such. I regret that. I suspect that COSLA which has said that it does not oppose the principle, also regrets it. For these reasons, I must ask Opposition Members to withdraw the amendment and to recognise that the Bill as drafted contains important safeguards to maintain the delegated powers of a school board except in circumstances in which its conduct would justify suspension.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not agree with the Minister. The interpretation of what constitutes serious failure or gross mismanagement continues to lie with the education authority, and there is no appeal by the board to any other outside body. However, as I recognise that the constitution of the Committee means that my amendment would be defeated if it were made the subject of a Division, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 75, in page 10, line 11, after "suspend", insert "the delegation of.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendments Nos. 75 and 76 are drafting amendments to make it clear that it is the delegation of a function that is being suspended. They would make line 11 of subsection (4) and line 17 of subsection (5) conform with subsection (3), line 7 and subsection (4), line 15.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 77 is a drafting amendment that seeks to insert the maximum period within which a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>526</span>
review by an education authority of a suspension of the delegation of a function must take place. The amended clause would require a review to be held between 12 months and 14 months after the suspension to which it relates while the Bill as drafted would have been open ended. I hope that the amendments will command the Committee's support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"Once the procedures described in subsections (4), (5), and (6) have been exhausted,".</p></blockquote>
This is a tidying-up provision which comes from COSLA. The amendment will ensure that school boards do not create additional work at local or national level by raising an appeal to the Secretary of State before the matter has been properly considered by the education authority. It is an uncontentious amendment which I hope the Minister will accept.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"(3A) If, during any financial year, it appears to an education authority appropriate to do so, they may reduce the sums of money allocated under this section to a school Board".</p></blockquote>
We have tabled the amendment because the authority could be subject to cash cuts from central Government, as authorities have been over the past decade. If each area of the authority's remit is subject to such cash control, it is logical that school boards should also find themselves in that position. The authority should review the provision that it makes to the community, and school boards should be considered as any other part of the local education authority's responsibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was half attracted by the amendment, until I heard the speech of the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) in defence of it. I shall not rise to the bait in terms of the resources that have been made available by central Government to education authorities, except to point out that they have been increased by 9 per cent., which is well ahead of inflation in the current year.

Clause 16(3) already provides for the financial allocation under clause 17 to be adjusted in the event of suspension of a delegated function, and if delegation were revoked the moneys would revert automatically. That seems to be the most reasonable case where such a provision might be desirable. I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman would withdraw the amendment, as I see no purpose to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once a budget has been agreed for school boards in the financial year, local authorities would not doubt be able to take account of that in their financial planning. Unless there is a change in the circumstances of a school board, it would be quite wrong and inequitable that its budget should be clawed back.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>indicated dissent.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 196 is a probing amendment to ascertain why the words "by such date" are in the clause. Our reason for tabling amendment No. 186 is that information about money paid in the previous financial year will not be available because of the short time that is available before school boards come into operation in August 1989. In many instances, authorities do not operate a comprehensive cost accounting system, and the process of change will take some time. It is therefore unrealistic to expect the information to be available for all schools, and time should be allowed for the systems to be upgraded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We firmly believe that all boards should have a right to receive information that will tell them clearly how their education authority is applying its financial resources to the school, and allow them if they wish, to express a view. A general duty on authorities would not be sufficient because it would provide no guarantee of the quality of the information or of the timing of its delivery—both critical factors if a board is to be able to make sensible use of the information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may allay the fears of the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) if I say that we could have set down a detailed specification of what was expected of education authorities in a schedule to the Bill. We did not take this line because we recognise that currently authorities vary considerably in their
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>528</span>
ability to produce useful financial information, school by school. So we chose quite sensibly to accommodate the detail of the specification in regulations. Before we make the regulations, we would consult authorities and boards to see what can be provided, what is needed and when.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By seeking a power of regulation here, as elsewhere in the Bill, we are trying merely to build in a degree of flexibility that will be of benefit to all who will be affected. That, I think, is what the hon. Gentleman seeks. In the case of the clause, the power will enable the Bill to keep pace with developments in the area of financial management and reporting which are taking placed within many authorities and will enable the Secretary of State to promote useful models.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that what I have said will reassure the hon. Gentleman, and that he will be willing to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our intention is to seek an assurance from the Minister that no school board will be able to raise money by charging fees for services at the school. School councils and parent-teacher associations have a tradition of raising money, which I am sure that none of us would wish to discourage, although some of us have reservations about schools in richer areas being able to raise more money than can those in poorer areas. There should be some evening out. It is a matter of commitment, however, on the part of parents and the school to the raising of money from their own resources. We all favour that, and it would be a retrograde development if fees were charged or boards were able to introduce fees in these circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No doubt the Minister will accept that the introduction of charges, apart from being an erosion

of the principle of universal free education—that is fundamental to many of us—would, in practical terms, discriminate against parents whose children were unwilling or unable to pay a contribution. It would be a regressive step that would undermine the basic thrust and objective of the Bill, which is to try to increase parental involvement rather than to introduce selection or access to education that is based on parents' willingness or ability to pay. The amendment is self-explanatory. I hope that the Minister can give us a clear reassurance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I hope that the amendment will prove unnecessary, but not being a lawyer, I cannot see in which respects the point that it seeks to make is covered in the Bill. If my hon.

In "School Management: The Government's Conclusions", we stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"to make clear that Boards will be in the same position as parents' Associations and other groups in fund raising, their power to raise funds should specifically exclude power to levy charges."</p></blockquote>
That is the only promise contained in the document that is not incorporated in the Bill. It was in the original draft, and I queried it because I sought to keep the Bill as short as possible. It became clear that such a provision was not absolutely necessary, so it was deleted.

My hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries raised the matter on Second Reading and my right honourable Friend the Member of Kincardine and Deeside and the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) have raised it as well. As we have sought to have a Bill which stands alone and which, as clearly as possible, spells out the functions of school boards, there is merit in having some type of statement in the Bill.

I am pleased that a number of names have been added to the amendment since it was tabled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Throughout all stages of the Bill, even from the consultation process, as my hon. Friend knows from my submission I have regarded as crucial the teacher's teaching function and his role as manager of the school. The head teacher is the most important person in a school, and at all stages—consultation process, Second Reading and in Committee—it is essential to try and preserve that role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause deals with finance, and I suspect that my hon. Friend will say that it is implicit in the Bill that the head teacher will be consulted before any decisions are taken. I want to make the position clear beyond peradventure. I hope that my hon. Friend will assure me that my objective is specifically covered and that we are not merely living in hope that it is met. I do not like living in hope; I like to make sure that such matters are properly covered when a Bill becomes law. I hope that my hon. Friend agrees with me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right honourable Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) has anticipated what I was about to say. In most but not all respects there is implicit in the Bill the expectation that a school board will consult a teacher on this and other matters. I was reluctant to accept my right honourable Friend's amendment because it seemed to move away from that general principle. I expect that in most instances consultation will take place, and it may be better to make such points in guidance rather than in bald statutory terms. However, as the amendment presents no difficulty in principle, and as there is clear agreement in Committee about strengthening the head teacher's functions and underscoring his role, I am happy to accept my right honourable Friend's amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Minister for accepting my amendment. He started by saying that it was the expectation that there would be consultation. My hackles began to rise because I have been in public life and politics long enough to realise that expectations do not always work out in practice. Obviously my hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks clarification about expenses that might be paid to a head teacher who was not a member of the board. The amendment seeks to make it clear that the head teacher will attend board meetings on a regular basis and that like other board members he may incur expenses. As the Bill specifically defines members of the board but does not refer to the head teacher, I am seeking the Minister's guidance on the arrangements for the head teacher.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Minister accepts that some head teachers could face significant expenses. Such expenditure may be covered automatically under their contracts, but it would be unfair and unreasonable to expect them to travel some distance, especially in rural areas, to meetings in the evening, and to refuse to pay their expenses while paying the expenses of every other member of the board. I seek clarification and guidance from the Minister about the position of head teachers in this minor but important matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are all grateful to the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) for raising this matter. However, there is no need to accept the amendment because travelling and subsistence allowances are already payable to head teachers and other teachers as part of their conditions of employment. Clause 5(5) requires education authorities to take appropriate steps to make head teachers available to fulfil their duties to school boards. Such steps should reasonably include the payment of travelling and subsistence allowances, where necessary. I am sure that head teachers in the hon.

The Bill says that when there is a vacancy for parent members
	<br><blockquote><p>"a by-election to fill the places of parent members shall be held as soon as is practicable".</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>532</span>
The amendment proposes that similar urgency should apply if there was a vacancy for staff members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our earlier discussions about the balance of membership between parents and staff, the Committee felt that the balance was too much in favour of parents and that the staff component was too small, especially in schools of a certain size. If a staff member moved on, it is possible that the board would have no staff representative. Leaving aside the previous argument, I am sure that the Minister would regard it as fair that measures taken to replace a staff member should have equal priority and urgency as those taken to replace a parent member. The amendment is necessary to achieve my purpose, but if the Minister can assure me that that priority can be achieved without it, I shall be happy to accept what he says.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of having school boards is to provide a forum for parents, and the provision that there shall be no school board
	<br><blockquote><p>"where insufficient parent members are elected"</p></blockquote>
arises from that central purpose of the legislation. If I were inclined to accept the amendment, it could be taken to mean that staff members were required to serve on boards. However, there has been a development in the Bill following consideration in Committee. Clause 2(12) deals with what happens when insufficient staff members are elected and says that clause 3(5) will apply. That subsection deals with by-elections and, as the hon. Gentleman will recall, I accepted that it should provide for a by-election to be held within three months of a vacancy arising.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The combined effect of clauses 3(5) and 2(12) would be to require a by-election within three months if insufficient staff are elected at any time. I appreciate that it does not go the whole hog—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would be the case when insufficient staff members were elected.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, because the provisions of clause 3(5) would still apply. It states:

Suppose that in a single-teacher school there is only a head teacher. Presumably, that head teacher would be barred from serving as a member of the board because, as head teacher, he would not be eligible to be a member of the school board. There would be an anomaly because there would be no staff representation on the board. Will the Minister reconsider that aspect and, perhaps, modify his proposals for single-teacher schools?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I could have a word later with the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy (Dr. Moonie) about that. Clause 2 provides for single-teacher schools. The Bill and the notes on clauses should answer his question. We can do little in legislation to change what happens in single-teacher schools—where the head teacher is a teacher and there are no teacher members. No amount of discussion or ingenuity on our part can change that. There is provision in the Bill to deal with such schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In principle, I am happy to accept the Minister's reply, but I still believe that the Bill does not clarify matters and misunderstandings could arise. Therefore, will the Minister undertake to ensure that when guidelines are published such a cross-reference will be made? The Bill gives the impression that there will be priority for a by-election for parent members, but not for teacher members. I realise that the amendment that was accepted earlier alters that. Nevertheless, without a cross-reference in the Bill, it would be appropriate if the guidelines clarified the matter.

I take the Minister's assurance that clause 3(5), as amended, means that a by-election will take place within three months rather than at

I have the ecstatic prospect of moving the last amendment, with the exception of the new clause.

I am sorry that my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro) is not here. Of course, my hon. Friend the Minister of State has an affection for Dumfries and Galloway, as has my hon.

It is now organising a series of schools which will operate school boards in line with the Bill. That experiment will benefit local authorities in Scotland, and I hope that they will consider emulating that example.

I am not inclined to accept the amendment, which simply shows in stark terms the Opposition's lack of commitment to increasing parental participation and their desire to put off the evil day, as they see it. Furthermore, the amendment should be rejected because it removes the ability of the Secretary of State to commence different parts of the Act on different dates if schedule 4, which abolishes school councils as statutory bodies, is commenced at the same time as provisions for the establishment of school boards.

This matter has concerned me for some time, ever since the publication of the original consultation paper. As school boards are to be set up for each
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>536</span>
school, it is important that there should be co-ordination between the boards. I quote from my submission as part of the consultation process, before the legislation was published. I recommended that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where there is a wish of several small primary schools, feeding one secondary, to join together, then there should be an opportunity for joint councils."</p></blockquote>
I continued in my submission:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I suggest also an area council for the feeder area of secondary schools which should have say, two representatives of each council in the area and which would meet at regular intervals but much less frequently than individual councils: there would, thereby, be co-ordination between primary and secondary."</p></blockquote>
My view was reinforced in an earlier debate on the name of school boards. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State at the time said that he preferred the term "board" and that perhaps the description "council" should be reserved for other purposes. That encouraged me further to table the amendment. That is a secondary reason, however.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
My main reason is that I feel that it is critical not only that we consider individual schools—we have spent much time debating individual schools and their school boards—but that we remember that no school is on its own but each is part of a system. The primary schools feed into the secondary schools and there is interest from the teaching viewpoint, for co-ordination with secondary school teachers and for continuity of education, and there is interest from the parents' viewpoint so that they know, as their children graduate from primary school to secondary school, that there is close liaison with the secondary school which eases children through from primary to secondary education. This can be a traumatic stage for children, not only their going out of the small school where they may be quite important, especially if they reach the top class, but the trauma of going to a big school where there are much older people. This applies especially in rural areas where they may have been in a small rural primary school. They have to go to a secondary school which, although it might not have exactly a city environment, has an environment that is akin to that of a town. For all those reasons, and countless others, there are strong grounds for ensuring that there is close liaison between primary schools and secondary schools, in both directions, as already happens. In setting up school boards, we should also provide for similar liaison between school boards if they are to have the effective function and role that this proposed legislation envisages.

I hope that the Committee agrees with me about the purpose of new clause 3. I feel that it is worth while and I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister and others will support the spirit and the principle behind it. I accept that the drafting may not be right, but I do not have the facilities available to the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened with interest to the right honourable Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith). His comments were very much in line with our thinking. Last August, when the Minister first produced his now famous

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>537</span>
scheme for school boards, I had to find a quick response. I hope that this August he will refrain from that practice. At that time, he burst on the Scottish public with his scheme and I had to work quickly with my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) to prepare a response. I was anxious to ensure that in any scheme of school boards—I make it clear that we favour extending parental involvement and influence in our schools—there should be a forum at which school boards, if they have a common interest, can come together to express it. New clause 3 appears to meet that objective and the Opposition support it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that the right honourable Member for Kincardine and Deeside is absent. I hope that he will not press the matter today so that if the Minister does not accept the new clause now he will reconsider it and perhaps come back on Report. I say that despite the fact that the right honourable Gentleman is not present to hear me. The Opposition support new clause 3.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, support the basic principle of the clause. In early consultations in my constituency with parents and teachers who were involved with the existing schools councils they made the slightly contradictory point, which the clause seeks to bring together, that people felt strongly that every school should be entitled to have a school board if the legislation were introduced but expressed anxiety and regret about the loss of the college element of linking feeder primary schools with their secondary schools as the new clause proposes. That link is important. I do not wish to repeat arguments that have been well put by the right honourable Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith), but there are clear links between feeder primary schools and their secondary school, which can usefully come together in a forum and exchange information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People want separate boards because they fear that if primary schools are grouped together big primary schools will take decisions to the detriment of small primary schools. The new clause is the ideal compromise. It would allow the formation of a school council covering several schools, while enabling each school to operate its own board. The Minister would meet many of the representations if he accepted the new clause. I agree with the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg) that if the new clause is not pressed to a Division in Committee perhaps we should come back to it later. Of course, if the Minister accepted the new clause he would resolve the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister showed earlier that he understood the force of the argument and was anxious to be helpful. I believe that to some extent that was the basis on which the new clause was tabled. I seem to recall that it was a response to remarks that the Minister made when the Committee was rather younger than it is today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the new clause. The Minister must accept that schools do not exist in isolation from one another, especially feeder
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>538</span>
primaries and secondary schools which exist as a sort of family unit. My son will move up from primary school to secondary school after the holidays. As part of the transition he will spend a week at secondary school before the holidays. At the conclusion of that week all the parents will be taken to the secondary school to liaise between the different feeder primaries and the secondary school and to see how their children have settled into the new secondary environment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has given school boards a clear responsibility to liaise with parents. If boards are to fulfil that role properly they should have the facility provided in the new clause. A school council would enable school boards to come together and liaise properly with parents and would help children to move from the primary level to the secondary level as my son will be doing. School boards could raise the parental contribution to the transition if the Minister is prepared to give way and to accept the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thoroughly endorse the proposal for a school council because much that is good about Scottish education could be threatened by the Bill. I refer to the possible atomisation of provision, with each school being on its own.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The liaison and coherence between primary and secondary schools has been developed during the past 10 to 12 years and an awful lot of good work has been put in to achieve it. Without the bond between primary and secondary schools much good may be lost from Scottish education. There many social, financial but most of all educational implications. We ask the Minister seriously to consider those aspects when we put forward the concept of school councils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My brief tells me to resist the new clause strongly, but I am impressed by the arguments of my right hon. Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith), of the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) and of Opposition Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems churlish to be unhelpful on the last amendment under discussion. I have tried to make it clear that we would very much welcome co-ordination between schools, especially between the feeder primary schools and their secondary schools to which my right hon. Friend referred. However, there are already statutory powers available to local authorities to make such provision. It is not necessary to write them on the face of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why is the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) smiling so broadly?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a simple point which the Minister should realise. He says that there are statutory powers for local authorities to make provision, but of course they will have to make it if it is not included in the Bill. The Government might have responsibility for finding the money for such a facility if it were included in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No doubt it will come as a great shock to the hon. Member for Dundee, East, but he

should be aware that we already pay for a substantial part of the education service, which has never been better funded. Who would pay for functions is not a consideration that I take into account. Like my right honourable Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside, I seek to find the best mechanisms to ensure the quality and improvement of Scottish education. I do not concern myself with the matters that deflect the attention of the hon. Member for Dundee, East.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right honourable Friend's new clause is not necessary, although I fully endorse the spirit behind it. I am tempted to leave it at that, and I believe that I have said all that it is necessary, but in view of the spirit of co-operation which we have enjoyed in Committee and the views expressed by hon. Members on both sides of it, I am happy to undertake to think about the matter again. I make no promises for Report, but I shall reconsider the options that are available to try to meet the Committee's wishes without burdening the Bill with a provision that is unduly complicated and defined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members were at pains to tell me that if we were setting up bodies defined in statute there should be clear lines defining their activity. I am reluctant to add a new layer of material to a Bill that is of reasonable length and which is reasonably coherent and understandable to the members of school boards and others who will use it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If my right honourable Friend will withdraw his new clause, I am happy to give him an undertaking to think carefully about his legitimate arguments, with a view to considering how we can meet them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his undertaking and assurance. I am grateful also to other members of the Committee for their strong support for the purpose of the new clause. I appreciate my hon. Friend's argument about the existing power that is available to education authorities, but without being ungracious I gently remind him and his advisers before Report that one reason why the Bill has been introduced is that a number of education authorities have not implemented certain powers available to them and which some parents might have welcomed. If we leave the Bill as it stands, the power would be there, but if school boards wanted to come together in a formal way they might be frustrated—I am guessing; I do not know—if an education authority did not wish them to do so, even if it had the power to enable them to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Against that background I am grateful for the Minister's undertaking, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Staffordshire, Moorlands (Mr. Knox) for the excellent way in which he kept the Committee in order. On not a few occasions he brought to the attention of the Committee slips by me and by the hon. Members for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) and for Dundee, East as we learnt the ropes. I also thank the 	<i>Hansard</i> writers and those unseen staff who enabled us to continue our deliberations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like also to thank the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg)—I hope that will not do him too much damage—for the excellent way in which he has conducted the Opposition in Committee. He has not kept us up late into the night but he has by the quality of his arguments won a number of amendments which we had not anticipated conceding at the beginning of our deliberations. We shall send the Bill back to the House a better Bill as a result of the hon. Gentleman's efforts, and those of his colleagues.

Committee Members will say that there are Committees and Committees, and this has been one of the most congenial and constructive Committees on which I have served. There has been genuine constructive dialogue across the Committee which has helped to draw out, develop and improve the Bill. That is what Committees are about. I shall go even further—having seen the expressions once or twice on the faces of the Minister's advisers—and say that the Minister has overstepped his brief. Although the Minister's advisers will not thank me for this, I encourage him to do that again because that is what his job is about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This has been a congenial Committee and I believe that there used to be a custom, after a long Committee to adjourn to the Terrace. I shall not take that any further, Mr. McWilliam, other than to say that this has been an extremely constructive and well-conducted Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
