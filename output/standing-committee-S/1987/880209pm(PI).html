</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is regarded as a key group of amendments by the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations. Amendment No. 135 seeks to give all tenants with assured tenancies the right to a written lease, which shall conform with a model lease drawn up by the Secretary of State. The other amendments pave the way for the principal amendment in the group, amendment No. 162.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of amendment No. 162 is to allow future housing association tenants, including re-lets, to retain their existing rights with regard to security of tenure. The amendment also allows the Secretary of State to establish housing association assured
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>506</span>
tenancies and to determine the circumstances in which they will be established and the terms of such tenancies. The amendment allows the increased use of private finance, which the Government seek in the Bill, for housing association projects, while not transferring all future housing association tenants to assured tenancies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are now in the depths of the technical issues of private rented sector legislation, so I hope that the Committee will bear with me. I wish to set out as accurately as possible the case that the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations has put to me because it requires careful scrutiny by the Government before they finally firm up their intentions in the Bill. Under the existing proposals in the Bill all future housing association tenants, including re-lets of existing tenancies, are to become assured tenancies. The Government briefing seeks to justify that proposal by the need to introduce private finance into housing association projects. If implemented, the proposal will have major implications for the housing association movement in Scotland and will change the nature of housing associations as we have known them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Federation of Housing Associations makes it clear at the outset that the housing association movement in Scotland welcomes the introduction of private finance where appropriate, feasible and useful. Indeed, housing associations have been using private finance for some time, especially in building-for-sale projects, and they welcome the opportunity to use private finance to a greater extent in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The housing association movement nevertheless regrets the impact of private finance on all future housing association tenants, and I have great sympathy with its case. By definition, the Bill reduces housing association tenants' rights. In the movement's submission, with which I agree, it will tend to increase rents and remove any right of arbitration or appeal on rent levels. That is a high price to pay to bring more private finance into the housing association movement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is appropriate to consider the loss of rights for housing association tenants because it could have an impact on many hundreds if not thousands of tenants shortly after the implementation of the Bill. Under the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Act 1980 tenants' rights provisions, consolidated in the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987, housing association tenants have unequivocal security of tenure. One of the key features of the right on which the Government properly built was wider security of tenure, which included the test of reasonableness with regard to proceedings for recovery of possession. Thus the sheriff, in making any order for recovery of possession in favour of the landlord has to be sure, first, that the landlord has a ground for recovery of possession—that is fair enough—and secondly that it is reasonable to make the order in the circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I served happily as a solicitor in Jedburgh sheriff court between 1980 and 1983, so I saw for myself how those provisions were put into effect by sheriff courts throughout the land. By and large, once the teething
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0358">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>507</span>
troubles were resolved, the provisions worked well. On a number of occasions in Jedburgh sheriff court the sheriff determined the question of reasonableness and acted as final arbiter in eviction decision. That fall-back position was used to good effect by tenants threatened with eviction and the safety net afforded by the test of reasonableness was one of the cornerstones of the tenants' charter provisions of 1980.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tenants of housing associations and housing co-operatives were given security of tenure in 1980, and tenants of local authorities, new towns and the SSHA were accorded the same protection under that act. Under the Bill, however, in clause 12 and in schedules 4 and 5, tenants of new towns, local authorities, the SSHA and in the future Scottish Homes will retain their security of tenure as set out in the 1980 and 1987 Acts, but tenants of housing associations and co-operatives will lose their basic security of tenure, which will be replaced by the limited security of an assured tenancy. Perhaps the Minister will confirm clearly that that legal analysis is correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the proceedings for recovery of possession, future housing association tenants will lose the test of reasonableness. That is the strongest suit in my case for amendment No. 162. If the Government accept the amendment, tenants of housing associations and co-operatives continue to enjoy security of tenure based on the test of reasonableness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Bill, if my analysis is correct, future housing association tenants will be subject to the same 17 grounds for possession as assured tenancies. Those grounds are listed in schedule 5, which provides that the first 11 will be
	<br><blockquote><p>"Grounds on which Court must order possession"</p></blockquote>
Clause 12, by transferring all future housing association tenants to assured tenancies, brings about a major reduction in the security of tenure which tenants of housing association and co-operatives have enjoyed since 1980.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Future housing association tenants, including re-lets, will also lose rights with regard to succession and the right to arbitration over rent levels as a result of the transfer to assured tenancies. The Government cannot argue that those are other than far-reaching changes. What has the Minister to say about that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions on tenants' choice in paragraph 6.10 the White Paper envisaged that existing public sector tenants would often wish to transfer to a housing association or a co-operative, but future housing association tenants will have significantly fewer rights than tenants of local authorities, new towns and the SSHA or the 83,000 tenants of Scottish Homes. In those circumstances, it is difficult if not impossible to envisage any public sector tenant in his or her right mind wishing to transfer to a housing association or co-operative as it would involve a significant loss of rights. Housing association tenancies will thus be unattrative not only to housing association tenants but to all public sector tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Federation of Housing Association is right to believe that, far from assisting the process of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>508</span>
diversification of tenure developed in recent years through the growth of housing associations and co-operatives, the proposal to introduce assured tenancies for future housing association tenants will severely arrest that process. If transfers of public sector tenants are to occur in future, they are far more likely to be to Scottish Homes, where tenants' rights will be maintained. The process has already begun wih the transfer of 1,077 houses in Castlemiik to the SSHA. We had discussions about that this morning. It is probable that Scottish Homes will be a far more attractive proposition for tenants than housing associations and co-operatives, so far from producing diversification and greater choice, these provisions are more likely to cause a significant expansion in the number of tenants of Scottish Homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I asked the Minister questions about that this morning, but I am still at a loss to understand what his answers amounted to. I shall study the 	<i>Official Report</i> with care as I cannot understand what on earth the Government are trying to achieve with these provisions. They are clearly going against the logic of their own case. Having discussed the matter in some detail with the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations, I believe that the Bill will lead inexorably to the position that I have described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government are not prepared to look carefully at the clause again, this part of the Bill will be fatally flawed and will not work. The Government must tell the Committee what they think they are doing by moving in this direction. If the Minister cannot satisfy us today, other members of the Committee will certainly wish to return the matter on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kincardine and Deeside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) in the questions that he has put to my honourable Friend the Minister because I am genuinely concerned about this problem, having studied it and knowing something of the work of Scottish housing associations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the honourable Gentleman said that the status of tenants would be changed because of the Bill's proposals regarding security of tenure. If that is the case, I find it difficult to understand why those provisions are in the Bill. I shall listen carefully to my honourable Friend when he answers those points. If there has been any misunderstanding, I hope that he will correct it. People have been encouraged to rent houses from housing associations, so if the Bill means that they have less security of tenure we shall be striking not only against the aim of the Bill but against all the work that put into housing associations not only by those who are professionally involved but by the many volunteers. That would be a pity. The honourable Gentleman has suggested that there is a genuine risk of losing the diversification sought by the Bill. We still have many housing problems in Scotland and we want to resolve them. My honourable Friend the Minister has said many times during our proceedings that we want to use all the possible means—public authorities, housing associations and the new Scottish Homes. We do not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0359">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>509</span>
want the Bill to do anything that will destoy the benefits of diversity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of housing associations work in my constituency, mostly in relation to sheltered housing, and I have nothing but the highest admiration and praise for what they do. I also know how much they are appreciated by their tenants. Therefore, I hope that my honourable Friend can reassure me and correct anything that we have got wrong. If we are right and there is a weakness here, I hope that he will agree to look at it again and come back to it later. I should be very surprised if he intends that tenants should be affected in the way that has been suggested. I look forward to hearing what he has to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Doran 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make a number of general points because we shall clearly have to spend a great deal of time on the specifics of the tenancy issue. It is a pleasure to follow a Conservative Member who has the courage to speak out and not simply to follow the Civil Service brief, which seem to be the Minister's main contribution to the debate. The right honourable Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) has made an important contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This part of the Bill involves a serious diminution in the rights of private sector tenants. I shall not go in detail into the points so effectively made in preceding speakers contributions, although I share the fears expressed. I wish to voice a number of concerns. The first relates to the diminution in tenants' rights and the creation of assured tenancies. My practical experience as a solicitor, which I think would be borne out by the majority of those in my profession in Scotland, is that the short tenancy introduced in the 1980 Act has not proved popular. It has not caught on and little use is made of it in Scotland. If the Minister has statistics which prove me wrong, I shall be delighted to hear from him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, there is a problem in the private rented sector which the Bill does not begin to tackle. My main experience as a solicitor is in acting on behalf of tenants who have experienced serious harassment and major deficiencies in the service that they are entitled to expect from the private sector. My experience is that landlords have used every device possible to get round the terms of the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984 and its predecessors. Any solicitor in private practice who operated in the areas where I operated was familiar with the licence—a Scottish legal device to get round the terms of the Act so that landlords could impose conditions on tenants and not meet their obligations to provide a rent book. The tenant was therefore unable to take his cast to a rent tribunal. The landlords could evict tenants without the necessity of going to court. The artificial creation of a resident landlord, or a member of the landlord's family being resident in the house, was used as a loophole to get round the Act, as was the provision of services, such as an early morning delivery of rolls and milk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Rent (Scotland) Act 1984 is a consoldiation of a number of attempts by successive Governments to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>510</span>
provide some security and peace for tenants in the private sector. I will not say that it has failed, which in large measure it has not, but even with the restrictions and tight control that the Act and its predecessors provided, there are huge gaps that are being exploited by landlords.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from temporary lets by people going abroad or going away to work for a period the private rented sector in the main comprises of houses at the bottom end of the market. These may be tenements requiring development, houses requiring modernisation and short-term accommodation where the most vulnerable people in our society tend to end up. In areas such as Aberdeen, where there has been a shortage of general needs housing and a non-availability of good quality local authority or SSHA housing, those types of houses were used for transient workers. It is at that end of the market where protections are most needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill will remove the bulk of the protections. We intend to through the schedule and part II in some detail, but I wish to express at this stage my severe disquiet about the Government's intentions. Another, general point, to which I shall return specifically when we come to discuss other parts of the Bill, is the dilution of the Scottishness or our law. I took the trouble this afternoon to go through the terms of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987—I am not trying to pretend I am an expert—and contrasted it with the English Housing Bill now in Committe also. Part II of this Bill corresponds with part I of the English Bill, and the same provisions—virtually word for word—are continued in the schedule that relates to eviction and removing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am greatly concerned because, as a Scots lawyer, Scots law is precious to me. We have our own history of leasing, which is unique to Scotland, and of making legal provision. We go back to the 15th century. I shall make specific references later to the protection that we provided for tenants. The Bill removes protections for tenants and the uniqueness and special character of Scots law is watered down. It is really an English measure, produced for English reasons, with an assured tenancy to deal with the particular problems of, for example, the shortage in the letting market in London. I have had experience of trying to find a flat in London, so I know how difficult it is. The English measures are being transported en bloc to Scotland through this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government Scottish Front Bench has a particular duty, especially with a Secretary of State who is an advocate, to pay some regard to the peculiarities and uniqueness of Scots law. To allow pressure to be applied from other parts of the Government to transport this measure en bloc into Scotland is reprehensible. These significant changes to Scottish housing law are being made virtually without comment and accepted by the Scottish Office without any real consideration. The Bill, particularly part II, does not relate to Scottish housing conditions or the specific problems of Scotland. It is an English measure being imported to Scotland for political reasons, and it has nothing to do with the proper needs of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>511</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart (Eastward)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Honourable Members on both sides of the Committee recognise that the debate is important. We shall listen carefully to my honourable Friend the Minister when he replies. The main purpose of transferring all future association tenancies from secure tenancies to assured tenancies is to allow the introduction of private finance. That, as a general principle, is welcome. As I understand my honourable Friend's proposals, however, in future the total programme for the housing association movement would be in two separate parts—public funding and mixed funding. Therefore, some of the housing of future tenants will be wholly publicly funded. There may therefore be an anomaly in treating all future housing association tenancies as though private finance were being used in every project, when in practice private finance may be used in the majority of projects, but not in a number for which it is not feasible or appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The fundamental question that we shall put to the Government on part II is what sacrifices they expect tenants in Scotland to make in order to attract private finance. We all welcome the introduction of finance, from any quarter, for the improvement or provision of housing to meet the growing need in Scotland. There must, however, be a threshold of pain somewhere, beyond which we should not except tenants in Scotland to go.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my honourable Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) that Scots law on housing tenure should be allowed to develop in accordance with the needs and circumstances of tenants and housing in Scotland. It is not a welcome development to have whole chunks of draft legislation transported from the Department of the Environment to the Scottish Office. The Committee should consider the proposals carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) concentrated heavily on the housing association aspects of the amendments. He is right to express the concern that must be felt in Scotland—it was echoed by the right honourable Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan Smith)—about the possible effect of this legislation on the housing association movement in Scotland. That movement developed relatively recently, and has achieved a great deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We could all cite examples from our own constituencies of area renewal in the inner-urban areas, or special provision for the needs of the elderly or handicapped in parts of Scotland The movement has achieved so much by motivated, public-spirited people coming together to work as members of the committees of housing associations, in the knowledge that they will be providing a service to the people of their neighbourhood, to elderly or handicapped people, to single homeless people, or to other special needs groups. They have done so under the present circumstances where they knew that they could get a good deal for those people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We ask the fundamental question: will these public-spirited, wholly well-motivated people be prepared to carry on doing that work and put in the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>512</span>
commitment, time and hard work that is involved in running housing associations if in the future they will simply be another private sector landlord charging high rents in accordance with the high market rents that may apply elsewhere in the neighbourhood?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fear—that fear was expressed in rather different terms by the right honourable Member for Kincardine and Deeside—that the legislation could tear the heart out of the housing association movement in Scotland. I know that the Government do not want to do that; there could be a consensus in the Committee. Perhaps the Government could usefully make some concessions and agree to reconsider this aspect of the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was especially grateful to hear the right honourable Member for Kincardine and Deeside say, "We have a lot of problems in housing in Scotland". Listening to his honourable Friends up to now, one would not think that that was so. We know that the right honourable Gentleman recognises some of the realities in Scotland which some of his honourable Friends find difficult to see although they are in front of their noses. There are serious problems in housing in Scotland. To serve our people properly, we should be seeking ways to overcome them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to move to a more general aspect of this group of amendments and especially to amendment No. 136. It would provide for the registration and approval of landlords by the Scottish Office. This is a wider issue than the narrow point concerning housing associations, although it would apply to them, too. It goes to the heart of the principle of the assured tenancy system in the future and what it has been in the past. This is new to Scotland; hitherto there has been only the so-called assured tenancy system in England and Wales following the Housing Act 1980.

The system has not been a spectacular success in England and Wales; not many assured tenancies have been set up. Private landlords and investors have not been falling over themselves to take advantage of the provisions; there may be good reasons for that, perhaps because there still were safeguards under the English assured tenancy system whereby any fly-by-night landlord could not get away with it. There was a provision requiring the Department of the Environment to register, inspect and approve the conduct of landlords who were operating the assured tenancy system outside the provisions of the secure tenancy system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members tell us that it is their intention to transplant the assured tenancy system that exists in England and Wales into Scotland. That is how the legislation that we are discussing was heralded. I shall quote directly from the Scottish Conservative party election manifesto. I shall not say much about it because it was not the most spectacular successful election prospectus. The Conservatives undertook to
	<br><blockquote><p>"legislate to introduce the system of assured tenancies already available South of the Border."</p></blockquote>
That is at page 13 of the manifesto published in May 1987.

The major feature of the assured tenancy system in England and Wales, which existed until May 1987, was a system of approval and registration of landlords who wished to make use of assured tenancies. The approval rested with the Secretary of State for the Environment. That approval of landlords was the assurance give to tenants of the bona fides of landlords who used assured tenancies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here we are moving into something different. The assurance, if it exists at all, is an assurance to landlords, not to tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the January-February 1987 issue of Shelter's housing magazine 	<i>Roof,</i> the honourable Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Mr. Patten), who was then Minister for Housing, Urban Affairs and Construction, said of landlords who would operate the assured tenancy scheme in England:
	<br><blockquote><p>"They will be respectable, responsible and registered."</p></blockquote>
He emphasised "registered", and went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This is not people with alsation dogs trying to kick down the door and evict you. It is like motherhood and apple pie."</p></blockquote>
In a similar vein, the honourable Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) has referred to the "criminal element" among private landlords whom at one stage he did not want to be encouraged to take advantage of the provisions that we are considering. There are such criminal elements, and the Minister was right to refer to their existence. One could cite hair-raising examples of bad practice by a significant minority of landlords in various parts of the country. We fear that the legislation goes too far. It will be possible for anyone who lets property after the passing of the Bill to take advantage of the assured tenancy system. There are no safeguards whatever. Tenants are being asked to sacrifice the safeguards of the secure tenancy system and to go into this terra incognita that the Government propose without adequate safeguards such as registration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From time to time, the honourable Member for Edinburgh, West has quoted Professor Maclennan. In 	<i>The Scotsman</i> on 21 December 1987, he was quoted as saying that the Government proposals on the deregulation of the private rented sector went too far down the road of investor confidence and paid too little attention to the real interests of private tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is anxiety about where the Government are going and how much freedom they are giving to all manner of landlords. Is there not a genuine case for allowing some provision for supervision, registration and monitoring of landlords and the practices that they can get up to? I invite the Minister to reflect on the wise words that he expressed just now about the criminal element among landlords. Before he rushes through the legislation, will he consider accepting some amendments which would provide a way to control that criminal element before it does any harm by exploitation or other bad practices affecting tenants who in future will be unable to protect themselves as they do now?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The honourable Member for East Lothian asked how popular assured tenancies had been in England and Wales. They were slow to begin, but became more popular later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister define "more popular"? What are the numbers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the honourable Gentleman wishes me to obtain the information, I can easily do so. Later in the debate I can give him the numbers for England and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Aberdeen, South said that the provisions are similar to the English ones. They aim to achieve the same effect: to halt the decline of the private rented sector. I assure the honourable Gentleman that the Bill is drafted entirely in accordance with Scottish law and does no violence to it. If he wishes to put forward any specific Scottish requirements, we shall consider them carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Aberdeen, South suggested that the short tenancy had been a failure. I agree that the takeup of short tenancies has been disappointingly low since they were introduced in 1980. However, that shows the need to find other ways to expand the provision of private rented housing. Short tenancies did not succeed because they were too restricted. The honourable Gentleman also asked about the private rented sector at the bottom end of the housing market. One aim of part II is to make private renting more attractive and to halt the decline in quality of the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, my right honourable Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) and my honourable Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) made an important point about the vital necessity of maintaining the momentum of the housing association movement with the full commitment of the volunteers behind it. I accept that. It is important to be clear that existing tenants retain all their rights to secure tenancy as long as they remain in the houses that they are occupying, and I think that all honourable Members accept that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tenants who take on new tenancies in the future will be assured tenants, but that does not involve an absence of security of tenure. Security of tenure will exist for as long as the assured tenancy, and when the original tenancy is terminated, a statutory assured tenancy will arise. Security will exist as long as none of the grounds for repossession is established, and we shall have to consider that with great care when we
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0362">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>515</span>
come to the schedule dealing with grounds for repossession. I endorse what my right honourable Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside said about vital importance of retaining the voluntary effort and diversity of the housing association movement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My honourable Friend the Member for Eastwood asked why housing associations that are not privately financed should be included and he mentioned two programmes. One purpose of introducing private finance is to make sure that public funding goes further. I accept that some housing associations will rely exclusively on the public sector for loan and grant and may not be in a position to attract any private finance. There is more than one reason, however, for making future housing association lettings assured tenancies. Dealing specifically with the point about private finance, I emphasise that many housing associations could potentially attract some proportion of private finance, even if only 10 per cent., thus enabling public funds to go further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The funding of housing associatons is a key subject of discussion between Scottish Office officials, the Housing Corporation and the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations. The idea of two programmes has been discussed, but it is by no means settled, and we may be able to improve the proposals in a way that would be of benefit to the growth that we all want in the housing association movement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened with great interest to the debate on amendments Nos. 162 and 285. Clearly, several points of concern to the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations have not yet been resolved in the detailed discussions that are in progress between it, the Scottish Development Department and the Housing Corporation. I note that one option for meeting those concerns is being put forward and I shall ask the officials to pursue those matters urgently. It will be possible to reassure the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations on many of its anxieties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that the amendments seek to give the Secretary of State considerable discretion. However, the housing associations themselves will enjoy considerable discretion under the Bill's provisions, which we believe they can be trusted to use responsibly. Further discussions will highlight the fact that, as with many of our discussions on part I, the points at issue are more about mechanisms than substance. In the light of what I have said, I hope that the honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire will withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to hear that those discussions are proceeding. Will my honourable Friend give an undertaking that if it appears that an amendment might be needed to meet the genuine sensitivities of the housing associations, he will consider tabling such an amendment at a later stage of the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly, if that is the case. I cannot give a guarantee now because we
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>516</span>
must see how the discussions progress, but I will make sure that my officials pursue that urgently and I reassure my right honourable Friend that should the need arise we shall certainly look seriously at it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 300 is less constructive and perhaps illustrates the difference of approach that distinguishes most Opposition Members from the honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire. The amendment would make it impossible for anyone ever to let on an assured tenancy a house that has been let on a secure tenancy. It is profoundly reactionary, in that no change or development is to be permitted, irrespective of tenants' wishes. It is significant that one of the main effects of the amendment would be almost to nullify the effect of the tenants' choice provisions under part III. It would remove the freedom for new landlords to offer tenants a new deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is significant that the amendment is expressed in terms of a restriction attached to houses with not a word about tenants. The amendment is designed to perpetuate domination of the public sector in some parts of Scotland and to deny tenants a real choice. Our commitment to improved choice and diversity makes it impossible for us to accept the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for East Lothian asked about landlords having to be approved on an assured tenancy under amendment No. 136. The amendment is unacceptable because it is totally contrary to the basic objective of part II. That basic objective is to extend the private rented sector by making it easier and more attractive for new landlords to enter the market. To add a requirement that all landlords should be registered would be a massive disincentive to any potential landlord—and not only "bad" potential landlords by any means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The history of existing Rent Act legislation is dominated by evasion and by the disincentive effect of all the restrictive controls that it imposes. To accept the amendment would be to start to slip back into the bad old regulatory habits and once again to enter the vicious circle of over-regulation and, as a consequence, decline in the quality and quantity of rented accommodation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

There is concern that bad landlords are driving out good landlords and good landlords would welcome the opportunity to register because they know they have nothing to hide. By accepting amendment No. 136 the Minister would still have the Bill intact and there would be no detrimental effect. Assured tenancies will come in anyway, so what would be the detrimental effect of the amendment, which only asks the local authority to set up a register? It would benefit those who want to complain about bad landlords, and those good landlords who

want to make sure that the neighbourhood is stabilised and that their good name and reputation is protected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman makes a relevant point. In parts of his constituency and in other parts of Edinburgh there have been abuses involving houses in multiple occupation, and the honourable Gentleman must have had many representations about that problem. Local authorities have powers to deal with such abuses under existing statutes. Under part VIII of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987, local authorities are empowered to serve a notice on the landlord of a house in multiple occupation requiring him to carry out work on the building to improve lighting, ventilation, water supply and drainage. They also have numerous other powers. For example, under section 152 of the Housing (Scotland) Act a local authority has power to introduce a registration scheme to enable it to obtain a record of information about the houses in multiple occupation in its area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Also under part VIII, the local authority can make a control order under which it takes over responsibility for running a house in multiple occupation when it is necessary to protect the safety, welfare or health of persons living in the house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other measures under the Public Health (Scotland) Act 1897 and the Housing Benefit (General Regulations) 1987 which local authorities can undertake in that connection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This amendment would be cumbersome and bureaucratic as well as acting as a disincentive. It would cause difficulties to good landlords, and bad landlords could ignore it with impunity. It would merely ensure that landlords letting according to the rules, under an assured tenancy, would need to be registered while those unregistered could not let on an assured tenancy. They could deny their tenants the protection that is built into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now say something about the difficulties of compiling a register. All members of the Committee will agree that a register would have no point if it were open to any landlord who applied to search, but if entry to the register was restricted, the criteria to be met would have to be defined. Any definition that any member of the Committee came up with would be bound to be somewhat arbitrary. It could not be made to work without destroying the effectiveness of part II. The proposals in the Bill are the best opportunity of increasing the supply of property for private rental.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it is so difficult to undertake this registration or licensing, why is it that for decades councils have been able to license taxis and public houses? They have licensing boards which are expert. They have in Scotland 1,000 years of accumulated experience. The Minister's argument is specious.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, one must weigh the balance of the advantage. What is indisputable is that the private rented sector has shrunk enormously: it is now just over 6 per cent. It
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>518</span>
is estimated to have been almost 90 per cent. at the beginning of the century, and it has certainly declined steadily with the years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for East Kilbride asked how many assured tenancies there were in England and Wales. There were a few hundred up to 1986 and there are now about 3,000. The numbers are realtively small in relation to the total housing stock. Even so, bringing back into use a significant proportion of the 130,000 empty houses in Scotland would help greatly in dealing with the problem of homelessness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I can reassure Opposition Members on amendment No. 160. One of the less satisfactory features of existing rent legislation is the opportunity that it has given to a few landlords to evade its provisions by claiming to provide board or attendance, which has sometimes been very limited. One of our aims in drawing up the new legislation was to ensure that no such loophole would exist in the future. There is in any case no reason why tenancies which include board and attendance should be exempted from being assured tenancies. Rents are to be set at market levels, which will allow landlords offering meals to obtain the proper rate for what they provide. That contrasts with the present position under which protected tenancies are subject to rent control. Under the current system it would clearly be unreasonable to expect a landlord who was offering meals in good faith to be restricted to receiving a regulated rent which would not take account of the board provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the Committee that the Bill has been drafted to ensure that all private sector tenancies will be assured tenancies except in the limited circumstances set out in schedule 4. Amendment No. 160 is unnecessary since its aim is already achieved by the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's words sound depressing to my ears. I am not at all satisfied with his response to my point on the importing into Scotland of English legislation. The Housing (Scotland) Bill reads virtually word for word the same as the English measure. I am even more depressed when I hear the statistics given us by the Minister. Three thousand assured tenancies in England and Wales over the six or seven years since the provisions were enforced there is an appalling record. The Government seem to be attempting to force this unpopular form of tenancy down the throats of landlords, tenants and the whole population of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are a number of misconceptions behind this legislation and, frankly, daft ideas. The Minister said that the private sector had shrunk to about 6 per cent. of the rented market. One cannot compare the housing market at the beginning of this century with the figures for 1988 and say that that is a bad thing. It has to be put in context, and the context is that there has been a huge development this century in the public sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must take into account the various housing markets. If we consider the rented market, we shall not find it difficult to categorise the sort of housing
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0364">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>519</span>
that people want. They want secure accommodation and long-term housing for themselves and their families. That long-term housing is not mainly provided by the private sector, for a number of reasons. It is provided by the public sector—the local authorities, the new towns, and the relatively new housing associations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The private sector has developed into making provision for the lower end of the market, using housing which, in other circumstances, might be regarded as below standard, and catering for short-term tenancies for people like me, for example, who need short-term accommodation in London. I hope that it will not be too short term. There is nothing wrong in using myself as an example, because I expect to have a look for other accommodation next October, when we return for the new session. It is for students, single people and young married couples who want to get their feet on the first rung of the ladder that the private sector is providing. It is not providing the mass housing of the turn of the century because it could never compete with the public sector, and it is foolish to think that it ever could.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The philosophy behind the Bill is a triumph of hope and dogma over experience. Our experience of the private sector are not good, as has been made clear in what I and other honourable Members have said about the way in which certain landlords go about their business. I am a wee bit depressed when I hear the Minister suggest that we need the legislation because bad landlords have managed to get away with it under the previous legislation. He used the expresssion "bad old regulatory habits", and justified the Bill on the ground that those bad landlords managed to get through the hoop and avoid the specific duties that the old legislation placed on them. He ignores the many good landlords who comply with the Rent Acts, manage to make profits out of their tenancies, provide rent books, leases and proper notices, and do not have to use hoodlums and hooligans and harassment to threaten their tenants into compliance and making no complaints about their terrible conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is wrong of the Minister to suggest that because these gaps existed we must now sweep away all the old regulations and introduce into the system a new flexibility—I think that we shall hear that word a great deal as the Committee proceeds—and at the same time ignore an opportunity to control the bad landlords whom the Minister accepts exist. I am sure that it is a move that will be welcomed by all those in Scotland who let property and comply with the law. The amendment would allow a simple system of licensing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another point that must be brought into the frame is the considerable sums of public money invested in the private sector. From my own experience I am well aware of the number of people in the private rented sector who depend on housing benefits to pay their rent. I consider that as an investment by the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>520</span>
state in the rented market, because most of those tenancies involve people living in very low housing. The rents are inflated not because the tenants can afford to pay them—most of them cannot—but because the state can. I have experience as a Member of Parliament and as a solicitor of how irregular the quantification of rents is. The tenant has no incentive to go to the rent officer, because it does not matter to him, he or she is not paying the rent. But at the same time the landlords can easily fix a rent which bears no relationship to the quality of the housing. That situation must be controlled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What must also be controlled, because there is such a huge investment of money in it, is the payment of improvement and repairs grants. Many properties are bought as tenements and are used for short-term letting until the landlord has managed to secure the repairs and improvement grants paid by the Government through local authorities. Again there is a huge investment of public funds in this end of the market and again that needs regulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is within the Government's power simply and easily to devise schemes to control that end of the market. For example, if there were a requirement to draw up a register of landlords, anybody not on that register would not become eligible for housing benefit or to receive repair or improvement grants. These are simple and practical ways in which the points that Minister has raised can be dealt with. But it seems that he and his team are not prepared to go to the length of ensuring proper controls. If the Government care about tenants across the board and in particular the vulnerable tenants who tend to be in the private rented sector, they must look seriously at these issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the remarks by my honourable Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran). Will the Minister go back and look at his answer to amendment No. 136? The only logical argument that he used against it was that the Scottish Office would have to employ more people and that that was unjustified, in view of the Government's philosphy of keeping unemployment high enough to keep the trade unions in their place. Other than that, his arguments did not hold water.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that we all want the private sector to play an increasing role in meeting housing need in Scotland. It is not meeting the needs of various groups at present—for example, those who move around the country in search of employment. Evidence was produced last week—it does not relate directly to Scotland, but is is still relevant—about the Tebbit express which every Monday takes people from Liverpool to work in London and brings them back on Friday. Those people cannot find houses in London becasue private sector rents there are enormous—as much as £500 a month. I know that because I am paying about that myself for a two-bedroomed flat with a bed that goes up into the wall. Ordinary working people, as distinct from Members of Parliament, cannot afford to pay that kind of rent. As I can see from your expression, Mr. Lambie, you do not pay that kind of rent either.

The private sector is not meeting the needs of people who move around the country. A constituent came to see me on Saturday. He has a job in London but can get no accommodation because the public sector is strangled by the Government and the private sector does not meet the needs of working people. We want the private sector to play a far more important role than it does at present. But this is not the way forward. The Minister says that the failure of the private sector is as a result of what he calls statutory controls. He seems to be arguing that the private sector has been in decline throughout this century because entering the private rented sector is not an aconomic proposition, because of security of tenure and rent control.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I do not think that the honourable Member has the slightest idea of how it developed. It developed originally with the reorganisation of local government a quarter of the way into this century. It got such a grip only because Socialism imposed private rented controls to such an extent that the only way one could get rented accommodation was by going to one's beastly local authority and being put on a waiting list.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Successive Governments, Conservative and Labour, have continued to support the principle of subsidising local authority housing as the best means of housing the working class in Scotland, until the present Government decided to move in a different direction. They are trying to argue—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) now argues that it is perfectly acceptable for the Government to subsidise individuals to live in public sector slums.

The honourable Gentlemen is happy to

subsidise individuals to live in rising damp and in terrible conditions. He thinks that that solves the problems of housing for the working class in Scotland.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government's solution in encouraging the private sector in Scotland is that all new lettings—not only for private landlords but housing associations—will either be on an assured or a short assured tenancy and that existing statutory provision on rent control and security of tenure will not apply. The basis of that argument is open to serious challenge—that it will lead to an encouragement of investment in the private sector and the opening of new tenancies for people in housing need. The Government must provide evidence that that will be so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Shelter brief points out that investment in the private rented sector has been in decline since before 1915 in Scotland, before any measure of rent control was introduced. To try to argue that the private sector declined because of rent control is turning the facts on their head, because that is not the case. The private sector has been in decline for a long time for many reasons. It has nothing to do with rent controls or security of tenure. If the Government believe that, they must produce evidence of a link between the two; that they have failed to do. Such evidence as does exist points to the necessity for rent control and security of tenure to safeguard the interests of tenants in the private sector. Shelter has pointed towards a consensus in Scotland that the private sector has failed miserably to provide accommodation of socially acceptable standards at affordable rents. The Government do not address that critical problem by weakening security of tenure and rent control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the White Paper accompanying the Bill the Government say that the present proposals are designed to reinvigorate the private rented sector, while protecting the tenant's essential interest. I cannot see any evidence of that. Such evidence as we have points towards the fact that the strengthening of the position of landlords at the expense of tenants' rights must inevitably lead to a deterioration in standards of accommodation. Shelter say that their experience at present is that high rents, poor housing and insecurity are the hallmarks of life for tenants in the private rented sector. It says that landlords manipulate their way round the existing statutory safeguards and resort to devices such as converting

one room into a shared bedsit and providing board to get round the rent control provisions. They claim residency themselves, possibly in the best tradition of the seedy landlord, Rigsby, in "Rising Damp" on television. Perhaps the Government want to encourage more Rigsbys in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister repeatedly suggests that the way forward is to weaken the security of tenure and the rights of the tenant to encourage the private sector. That argument is basically flawed and the Minister should reconsider it. I see no excuse for not adopting the idea of registering the approving landlords by the Secretary of State through the Scottish Office. Such a system already operates in England and Wales and has been supported time and time again by Ministers who maintain, when they are under question about England and Wales, that landlords will continue to be registered. The Minister is now saying that it is OK for England and Wales but it is not OK for Scotland. It was in the Conservative party manifesto at the last election. It is now realised that the Government have no mandate for implementing any of their manifesto promises in Scotland. This is one part of their manifesto that they should try to implement. We certainly do not want the poll tax or any of the other things they promised in their manifesto, but on this issue at least they would have the support of the Scottish people if they introduced a device to register landlords to make sure that exploitation did not take place under the new assured tenancies. The belief of Opposition members and throughout Scotland is that the Government are creating a landlords' charter at the expense of tenants' rights. They will not get away with it in the long run.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My honourable Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) was giving details of the Conservative party manifesto. We are complaining that it specifically said that the Conservatives would introduce an assured tenancy system the same as then existing in England and Wales—the one that the Minister said had managed to achieve 3,000 tenancies in a nation of 50 million people in eight years. That was not the greatest achievement one might hope for, but that is what they proposed to do in Scotland. The trouble is that they are introducing a completely different type of tenancy that is in no way assured.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a sense this a slightly unfortunate grouping of amendments, because on one amendment, relating to housing associations, there is total consensus in the Committee. It has been referred to by the honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, by several of my honourable Friends and by the right honourable Member for Kincardine and Deeside. Indeed, the Minister responded fairly positively to that and said that he is willing to have another look at housing associations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is unfortunate that housing associations will be able to let on any terms that they wish, except on secure tenancies. Some housing associations may want to carry on letting on secure tenancies. I hope
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>524</span>
that the Minister will reconsider that, especially in the light of what his right honourable Friend said, and that in that spirit we can make progress, at least on that aspect of the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to amendment No. 136 and our case for providing a system for registering and approving landlords. The Minister dismissed our case, saying that it was a wicked, retrograde idea that would wreck the wonderful principle of the assured tenancies that the Government are seeking to set up. I invite him to consider just what he is trying to let loose in the highways and byways of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was the Minister who referred to the criminal element among landlords, and one wonders why he and those whom he wants to help are so alarmed at the prospect of a registration or approval system for landlords. That was the sanction that existed in the English legislation. It might have been the sanction which deterred thousands of landlords from taking advantage of the system, because landlords knew that if they abused their rights and exploited tenants, they would be taken off the register and their tenants would immediately become secure tenants. It was a useful deterrent to ensure that there would be no bad practices by landlords who wanted to move into assured tenancies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we have already established, in this nation of 50 million people and presumably 20 million or 25 million houses, in seven years only 3,000 tenancies have been achieved. One might describe trying to build on that principle as building on failure. We would certainly have no objection to the principle involved in that type of assured tenancy, but what the Government are proposing in the Bill is altogether different: it is the mark 2 assured tenancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whereas the private sector was not performing in England and Wales, even given the incentives under the mark 1 assured tenancy system, it was certainly not performing or responding in Scotland. I forget the detailed figures, but the private rented sector is almost negligible in Scotland today. It has an alarming proportion of the empty houses and substandard houses in Scotland. Therefore, we wonder whether these are the sort of people whom we want to encourage in the future; they seem to have abdicated their responsibility in the past. The Government believe that the only way to encourage those people to come back into action and reactivate the private rented sector in Scotland is to increase incentives to landlords by allowing them to charge higher rents and reduce the security of tenure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister sought to allay our fears on that by saying "Don't worry. The assured tenancy has some security and when it comes to an end, it becomes a statutory assured tenancy. The tenant will be all right on the day." He is skating over the fact that at the end of an assured tenancy there will be no fewer than 17 grounds for eviction, of which 11 will be mandatory. We shall come to those grounds in schedule 5, but this is not the motherhood and apple pie referred to by the Minister of State, Home Office, the honourable Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Mr. Patten). This is a much more alarming form of tenancy, and not the sort of tenancy I should want many Scots to get themselves into. It could turn out
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0367">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>525</span>
to be a trap for too many of our constituents. I believe that it is wrong and, if it does work—there is no assurance that it will because the private sector has not been remarkable for its response to the Government's efforts to encourage it—I fear that it will be at a high price to people in Scotland who can ill afford it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is for the honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire to decide what to do with his amendment. If I may offer him some advice, I should be inclined to accept, for what it is worth, the Minister's assurance that he will reconsider the housing association aspect of this group. I should certainly be inclined to advise my honourable Friends, and indeed the whole Committee, to consider voting for amendment No. 136.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to take up the advice offered by the honourable Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson). Having listened carefully to what the Minister said earlier, I believe that there is some prospect of reconsideration, clearly qualified by the careful way the Minister put it, as I know he must on these occasions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Minister is right to say that security of tenure obtains in assured tenancies. But it is a question of the quality of security of tenure and, even more important, the comparative security of tenure as between that which tenants enjoy at present and that which they will enjoy under the new assured tenancy. At present the sheriff can found on a test of reasonableness as a fall-back position. Those who provide advice to people considering making the change will almost certainly come to the conclusion that security will be reduced in an assured tenancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether the Government consider that right or wrong, I say to the Minister with all the conviction that I can muster that that is the view that will be taken, whether the Minister likes it or not, and it must be a key factor in his assessment of whether the Bill will succeed. It is not simply a question of the provisions of section 48(2) of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987, under which the sheriff has the test of reasonableness. I have referred also to the loss of rights to arbitration and of the right of appeal on rent levels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to dwell for a moment on rent levels, because I deliberately did not advert to them in my opening remarks on amendment No. 162. At present, under the fair rent system, housing association rents are significantly higher than local authority, SSHA or new town rents. That is certainly the case in my experience. On average in my own area they are 30 per cent. higher, but I do not know whether that is reflected in other parts of the country. While the Government have said that existing regimes for rent fixing in local authorities and the SSHA are to be maintained, the fair rent regime is to be scrapped for housing associations and replaced by an alternative, described as an "affordable" system. The introduction of assured tenancies will lead to the scrapping of the fair rent system for future housing association tenants, including re-lets. In its place will be a system whereby Scottish Homes and individual housing associations will negotiate about the grant
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>526</span>
available for specific projects. Scottish Homes will finally determine the level of grant, which will be crucial in determining rent levels. The Government have given no clear indication yet of what they expect the average level of grant to be, although I understand from my sources south of the border that the Department of the Environment has suggested levels in the range of 50 to 70 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Federation of Housing Associations, on the basis of information gathered by Glasgow housing associations, the Housing Corporation in Scotland and Mr. John Hills of the London School of Economics, estimates that if grant level is reduced to 70 per cent. rents for housing association tenants in the future will increase by between 40 and 100 per cent., depending on the nature of the project. New building projects will tend towards the lower end of that range, while rehabilitation projects will naturally tend towards the higher level. If average grant is to be reduced still further, the rent increases would be even greater. Moreover, as I pointed out earlier, they will apply not only to projects in which private finance is used but to all future housing association projects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At this stage, when the Minister is considering what he has undertaken to do about security of tenure, it is important to examine also the notion of affordable rents and how it will affect people going into the new assured tenancies. Ministers have said that housing association rents will be affordable for the traditional tenants of housing associations under the new scheme. As yet, an exact definition of "affordable" has not been made available, nor has any clear indication been given of how it will be determined. Assuming a common-sense definition of "affordable", however, it is unlikely that rent increases of the order of those outlined above would be on the agenda, especially taking into account the characteristics of housing association tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister and other members of the Committee are aware of the survey of more than 1,000 tenants of Scottish housing associations undertaken in the spring of 1987 by Stirling university. That survey found that housing associations were fulfilling their basic aim, to provide housing for individuals and families in housing need and necessitous circumstances. The survey found that 42 per cent. of new lets were to elderly people. That is one third higher than in a similar survey in England and Wales. Further, 28 per cent. of households were economically active in some form of employment, but 94 per cent. of all households had net incomes of less than £140 per week—that is supplementary benefit plus 40 per cent., which is the established poverty line below which most commentators accept that some degree of poverty exists. Again, 85 per cent. of the households which were economically active had net incomes of less than £140 per week. Those figures have been made available to all members of the Committee. The interim report is called "Who Do we House?" and the survey was carried out in 1987 by Stirling university.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In general, housing associations house individuals and families on low incomes, even where the household is economically active. A genuinely affordable rent for the traditional housing association
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0368">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>527</span>
tenants would therefore tend to be around the present fair rent level, so the scope for significant increases is very limited unless housing associations are expected in future to provide housing for higher income tenants, which is not the present intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am filled with apprehension about the housing benefit changes that are to be inflicted on us in April this year. It is sometimes assumed that whether or not rents increase significantly for housing association tenants is irrelevant because all housing association tenants will be protected by the housing benefit system. As the Minister knows, John Hills of the London School of Economics pointed out in his report:
	<br><blockquote><p>"What is strikingly clear, is that the new system of Housing benefit (in operation from April 1988) will not protect tenants on low earnings from very large increases in their net rent: net income rations (i.e. the proportion of their net income they are spending on rent) if rents were to rise above their current levels. The problems are worst for single people and couples without children; similar problems would face those on small occupational pensions."</p></blockquote>
It is clear that that proportion of housing association tenants who do not receive housing benefit, which is approximately 30 per cent. of tenants, would have to pay
	<br><blockquote><p>"a much greater proportion of their net income on rent than they can reasonably afford".</p></blockquote>
Housing association tenancies would thus become unaffordable for low income people in employment, and for many elderly people on occupational pensions, if rents were to rise significantly above their present levels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The SSHA proposal enshrined in amendment No. 162 is that there should be two separate grant structures for funding housing associations. First, the publicly funded grant structure would retain all the main essential features of the existing housing association grant system. That would also mean that the present system of fair rents being set by independent rent officers could be retained. Equally, the rights of existing and future tenants, in particular security of tenure, could be maintained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, there would be an entirely separate mixed funded grant structure, designed to allow for the use of private finance, which the Minister is keen to do. The housing association assured tenancy would apply and the Secretary of State would determine the details of the tenancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will consider all the angles. It is not just the question of security of tenure, but of affordability of rents. I hope that he will have second thoughts and reconsider these points carefully before coming to his final conclusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am conscious of all the matters that the honourable Gentleman mentioned, and will reply to a number of the points raised in this debate. The matter of security of tenure must be seen in perspective. For example, there are 16 grounds for possession, even under the Tenants'
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>528</span>
Rights Etc. (Scotland) Act 1980 provisions, so that even for tenants in the public sector there are grounds for repossession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) was concerend about the 17 grounds for possession in the Bill, of which 11 are mandatory. Those 17 compare with 21 under the existing Rent (Scotland) Act 1984, of which 10 are mandatory. We must look carefully at the schedule that deals with those grounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for East Lothian raised an important point about housing associations that wish to let on terms indentical to secure tenancies. They would be free to incorporate such terms into the tenancy agreement, which is an important point to establish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They would?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. Housing association rents vary widely. There is no merit in setting rents by reference to local authority or any other rents. The key consideration must be what those who will live in the houses can afford.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Speculation about vast increases in rents for new lettings has been widely alarmist. The percentage increases will not be forced by existing tenants, whose rents will continue to be registered by the rent officer. That is all part of our reasonable and gradual approach to the changes in the financial regime for housing associations. I have already made it clear that we shall continue our discussions with the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations, with a view to reassuring its members on as many points as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On amendment No. 136, I must stick to what I said earlier. The effect of requiring registration of all assured tenancy landlords would be to erect unnecessary barriers that would prevent good landlords from making property available for rent. That would do nothing to help the homeless or to reverse the decline in housing for private rent. Furthermore, the registration system proposed by honourable Members would not work. It would be excessively bureaucratic and difficult to enforce. I therefore urge the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister dismisses our proposal as bureaucratic and difficult to enforce. Surely it would not be all that difficult for a prospective landlord, no matter how many properties he may intend to let, to go either to the local authority or to the Minister's Department and announce his intention so that he can be put on the register and licensed to let on assured tenancies. The Minister could then simply forget about it until such time as he received any complaints, which could then be investigated. If something were found to be wrong, that landlord's licence to let on assured tenancies could be withdrawn. That is not particularly bureaucratic. It has applied in England and Wales for the past seven years, so why not in Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the honourable Gentleman will allow me, I shall finish what I was saying. A balance must be struck to encourage those who own the properties to bring a substantial proportion of them back into operation. Of the 130,000 empty houses in Scotland, the figure for the private sector may be as high as two thirds, leaving a third in the public sector. It is certainly more than half. That is a considerable number of empty houses that we want returned to the market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A balance must be found between the safeguards—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What safeguards?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I just mentioned some of them. I spoke about the strengthened position of tenants against harassment and illegal eviction. A tenant with an assured tenancy can obtain determination of rent from the rent assessment committee if, at the end of his initial tenancy agreement, the landlard proposes a new rent that the tenant does not accept. A tenant with a short assured tenancy can apply to the rent assessment committee for a determination of a reasonable market rent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a further safeguard from abuses of the housing benefit system by landlords, which undoubtedly has been taking place in certain circumstances in Scotland. All rents for short assured tenancies for which housing benefit is payable will have to be referred to the rent office to assess the proper market value for the premises. If he finds the rent to be excessive, housing benefit subsidy will be limited. Clause 64 deals with housing benefit abuses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that Opposition Members can devise sanctions to apply to bad landlords, but no honourable Member has suggested how to apply any effective sanction to bad landlords who might refuse to register. Withholding housing benefit would hurt the tenant as much as the landlord, and bad landlords are not particularly interested in improvement grants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I submit that the proposals in the Bill are the best opportunity of increasing the supply of property for private renting. The beset way to ensure that bad landlords are forced out of the market is when tenants can turn to other, better landlords for their accommodation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee can deal expeditiously with the amendments. Although they are important, they are self-explanatory. Amendment No. 135 would provide all tenants with assured tenancies a right to a written lease, which must conform to a model lease, in accordance with the terms of amendment No. 135, drawn up by the Secretary of State. It is important that both landlords and tenants are aware of their rights and obligations and that those should be firmly constituted without any doubt or uncertainty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That has already been recognised for secure tenants, who have a right to a written lease under section 53 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987. Without a written lease, verbal agreements are extremely difficult to prove and are a major cause of friction and lititgation between landlords and tenants. At present, where leases are provided they often contain clauses weighed heavily in favour of the landlord. They frequently contain clauses that attempt to deprive tenants of their rights, both statutory and under common law. Being unaware of their legal rights, those tenants feel bound by such clauses.

Far too often, landlords have their leases drawn up by agents, many of whom found heavily on English law. As the honourable Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) said, there is a continual encroachment into Scots law of English terms and other alien concepts and jargon, which is to be deplored. We shall all be out of a job—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] I expected an intervention from the honourable and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Fairbairn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Perth and Kinross)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like an example of the terms that the honourable Gentleman regards as English and alien. Will he explain amendment No. 135? What does
	<br><blockquote><p>"express terms of the contract"</p></blockquote>
mean? That is not a term known to the law of Scotland, as far as I am aware. Does it mean that it has to be the totality of the terms of the contract such as, "There will be two sheets, one teaspoon, a coal scuttle, a boat" and the like? Secondly, what does "the terms implied by statute" mean? Statutes do not have implications. They either have or do not have duties. It is another term not known to the law of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can show the honourable and learned Gentleman sheafs and shoals of standard leases. Commercial leases are worse than domestic leases. When I was in my provincial solicitors' office in Hawick I had to revise documents spewed out by word processors that has been derived from English textbooks. They bore no relation to the normal terminology of Scots law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I confess to the honourable and learned Gentlemant that I had more in mind commercial leases rather than Rent Act leases. As he has pressed me to explain paragraph (i), I am hoist by my own petard because neither of those terms would make much immediate sense to Scots lawyers. However, the sense is quite clear and the amendment bears close scrutiny. The
	<br><blockquote><p>"express terms of the contract"</p></blockquote>
are those borne on the face of the lease, and "terms implied by statute" means, I guess, the common and other parts of the law that would not necessarily be on the face of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 or this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Too often, landlords have their leases drawn up by agents, who have a limited knowledge of the law. They then feel able to act on any clause contained in the lease agreement, even where it contradicts statutory rights and common law. Apart from being unable to afford independent legal advice prior to signing a lease, many tenants are often pressurised, on a take-it-or-leave-it basis, to sign contracts that they barely have time to read.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There therefore is cause for some concern. Responsible landlords can have no real objection to granting a model lease setting out the statutory rights of tenants, regulating such matters as may be prescribed by the Secretary of State—in which I should, for example, include a right to repair—and detailing the obligations of both parties. At least the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>532</span>
sense of amendment No. 135 should be clear to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 137 seeks to prevent a tenant bearing any cost of preparing a written lease. There has been some controversy recently about that. It has been recognised that a secure tenant should not be required to pay any fees in respect of a written lease under the terms of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987. At present, tenants are frequently asked to pay £30 or more for a lease which more often than not is simply a photocopy and in no way justifies the charge. The current rent Act allows charges where the lease itself makes provision for the tenant to share and bear part of the costs. But frequently the landlords demand payment for leases where the leases themselves make no requirement for the tenant to pay. However, to make this an issue would simply lead to agents altering the leases to make tenants responsible for the costs. Nevertheless, any charge allowable against the tenant for the drawing up a lease is simply another entry charge into the profit margin of the landlord and discriminates against the poor and the badly housed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 140 seeks to allow the sheriff some power to intervene and order the provision of a lease, and also to vary the terms of the lease following the precedent of the Mobile Homes Act 1983. Should the argument for a model lease be accepted at all in amendment No. 135, it would be essential to have a mechanism for implementing it and for adhering to its provision. Should it not be accepted, it would be even more important for tenants to have the right to appeal against any terms in a written lease that they considered onerous, given that in the market the potential tenant is not in an equal bargaining position with the landlord. The precedent for fair terms of tenancy or contract already exists under section 53(4) of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 and section 2 of the Mobile Homes Act 1983.

There are important concepts and I hope that the Minister will give his initial reaction to them, because the Committee will want to hear it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I seek to relate amendment No. 135 to amendment No. 140. Although there is no sanction, the landlord has to give a written lease under amendment No. 135. How then, in amendment No. 140, can it come about that six months later he has not given one? It is an extraordinary concept that one can go to the sheriff court and get the sheriff to rewrite the terms of the lease. That is an extraordinary interference between the contracting parties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have thought that there was nothing untoward in the sheriffs having discretion to use his judgment. He can already do that in many cases—for example, on unfair terms of contract law in other spheres. I do not see why he should not be given the fall-back discretion in order to resolve some of these disputes. The sheriff court procedure is fairly informal and would be available to

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>533</span>
tenant and landlord alike in the event of a legitimate difference of opinion or if either were trying it on. There would be an easy right of redress to the sheriff court and I see no objection to that. Amendments Nos. 135 and 140 sit reasonably well together, so I do not follow the honourable and Gentleman's objection. If amendment No. 135 and the model contract were accepted, there would have to be some means of enforcement if the landlord delayed inordinately in producing the written terms of the contract.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I simply used the amendments as vehicles to probe the Government's intention, to find out whether any thought has been given to these situations and whether there are ways in which the Bill could be improved to meet some of the points that I have raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to support the amendments. The honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) has rightly pointed to the provisions of section 53 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987, which place a specific obligation on the landlord in public sector tenancies to provide a written statement of the terms of the lease. When we move into the pick-a-landlord scheme, what happens to the right under part III for public sector tenants to choose a landlord when they cease to be public sector tenants? Is that another right that they will lose? They have already lost the right, as was confirmed in previous debates, to attend meetings of their local authority housing committees. What will happen to the right under section 53 of the 1987 Act when a tenant transfers?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point is also related to points made by the honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire. It concerns the ambiguity that can exist and the vulnerability of the tenant in these situations. Good landlords will want to enter into contracts because it will help them as much their tenants for everyone to know the exact terms on which the properties are let. The rents, terms and conditions will be specified and no one will be in any doubt as to how the lease will operate. There will be specific periods and all sorts of other things.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The good landlords, however, are not the problem. We seek to deal with those landlords who seek to evade their responsibilities and try to enforce a "flexible" arrangement on the tenant. I could give a myriad examples. In my experience, the bad landlord is interested in a contract only if it is on his or her own terms. I mentioned in earlier debates and the introduction of the licence. Licences were specifically drawn up by landlords with a view to evading the terms of the rent Acts and depriving tenants of protections and rights. The amendments should be uncontentious as they simply require the parties to a specific and fairly fundamental contract—on the letting of property—to regularise it in written form. We are not seeking much.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other spheres in which the law has laid down such obligations. For example, in employment law there is an obligation to provide a written statement of terms and conditions which can be enforced through an industrial tribunal. The
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>534</span>
employment law specifies the elements which constitute a minimum statement of terms and conditions. It is difficult to see why in another fundamental relationship—that of landlord and tenant—the Government do not see the possibility of including this fairly basic right which has already been included in the public sector. We simply ask for the rights to which any private tenant should be entitled. If the Government want to provide flexibility, to widen choice and to improve the rights of tenants, they must look at these fundamental issues and stop producing the stock answer that because they have not done it before they do not intend to do it now. In any case, they have done it before—for public sector tenants. There is no good reason why they should not do it for private sector tenants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This group of amendments is of central importance. I hope that the Minister will help us. It stands to reason that tenants in any circumstances should have a right to a written lease and a rent book so that there is a proper record, both for the tenant's and the landlord's benefit, of payments made. There should be a written statement of any terms and conditions attached to the lease, and to the payment of rent or of any relevant information. Landlord and tenant relations are potentially a minefield of disputes and difficulties that could lead to litigation, and it is important that a written statement should clarify who has an obligation and to whom, so that any difficulties that arise can be resolved sensibly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to concentrate briefly on amendment No. 140, which would allow the sheriff court to intervene and to order the provision of a lease and also to vary the terms of the lease following a precedent which has been set by the Mobile Homes Act 1983. The Minister has acknowledged time and time again that many private houses are standing empty. Opposition Members have stressed that a great many people are desperate to get the tenancies of houses. If the Minister is successful and people start to offer these properties to let and upgrade them properly, people will be seeking those tenancies if the properties are in suitable neighbourhoods. It is important for tenants to have a right to appeal against any terms in a written lease that they consider to be unfair or onerous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a market where demand currently exceeds supply, the potential tenant is not in an equal bargaining position with the landlord. It is likely that if a landlord is about to start letting property, a tenant or prospective tenant who has been stuck on the local authority housing waiting list perhaps for years, will be willing to sign almost any bit of paper in order to get his family into a house. There is a case for creating a framework within which the terms of such leases can be reviewed if they are found to be unfair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a precedent for fair terms of tenancy or contract in the public sector. My honourable Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) has referred to section 53 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987. There is another precedent in section 2 of the Mobile Homes Act 1983. There are precedents to deal with the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the honourable Gentleman has read the amendment. It is not a right of tenants to appeal, but of either party. He seems to be speaking only as if prejudice could arise in one direction. Does he subsume the right of either party, if the terms of the contract into which each voluntarily enters are varied by the court, to say that he is no longer party to the contract, because the court has made it a different contract from that which he signed and therefore he is resiling from it? That is an important matter which is not dealt with by the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable and learned Gentleman is clearly familiar with the legal procedures. I accept that we are in uncharted waters. But there is a legitimate fear that if the Government are right, there could be a spate of these new, assured tenancy leases being signed all over Scotland. As I have already suggested, a lot of people, if they see houses coming on to the market to let, will take advantage of them and be prepared to sign almost anything in order to get their families into a house, because it is better than being overcrowded, homeless or in the difficulties that we have been discussing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There must be genuine anxiety that unreasonable leases will be signed, that a week, month or year later people will discover that they are in a trap and that on any reasonable analysis of the situation, they were ill-advised to sign the piece of paper. Do they then walk out, give up and become homeless again, or should there be a way to review the matter? The court would seem able to assist, although I accept that that would not be the perfect way to go about it. I invite the Minister to address himself to the possibility of abuse, hardship and difficulty. The Government should consider ways to deal with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been an interesting and important short debate. The honourable Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) asked about a written lease under part III of the Bill. Whether there is a statutory right to a lease under part III will depend on who the receiving landlord is. In other words, tenants moving to Scottish Homes will certainly have a statutory right. All tenants will be in a position to require a written lease as a pre-condition of their agreement to transfer, so any tenant can be sure that if he asks for it, he will be able to get a lease as a pre-condition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I understand. Is the Minister confirming the point that I made, that if a tenant chooses to transfer to a private landlord, he will need to make it part of a contract with that private landlord that a lease be provided? Is that the case?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Any tenant can make it clear that he would like a written lease and that he will not consider entering into the contract without a written lease.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister accept that tenants are often unaware of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>536</span>
their rights in respect of housing legislation? If one considers the thick documents that honourable Members have here, many members of the Committee are probably unaware of those rights. Tenants often cannot afford independent legal advice to ascertain their rights. More importantly, they are often desperate to obtain a fiat from the landlord and are not in a position to require the landlord to give them anything. They are totally vulnerable and at the landlord's mercy. It is not good enough for the Minister to say that they can require the landlord to give them a written lease. The landlord would say, "No, I'll get someone else in here if you don't want it".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, the honourable Gentleman is moving on. The honourable Member for Aberdeen, South related his question to part III. It referred to a council tenant who wished to transfer to a different landlord. The honourable Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) is asking about anyone who wishes to obtain a house in the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under part III, Scottish Homes can play a part in the discussions of tenancy terms by giving guidance to tenants and landlords about a proposed lease and what is appropriate or inappropriate. I dealt earlier with a question from the honourable Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson). In any breach of contractual conditions, a landlord can be taken to court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall start with the points raised by the honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood). I recognise the strong and compelling arguments that he has put forward in favour of a requirement for a written lease for every assured tenancy. I have noted especially that since public sector tenants have a right to a written lease, private sector tenants should be treated no less favourably. Amendment No. 135 would not achieve the honourable Gentleman's aim, but would exempt any tenancy which is not subject to a written lease from the assured tenancy provisions. This would reduce the tenant's protection rather than increase it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also not convinced that the legislation should stipulate, as amendment No. 135 seeks to do, what is to be included in the written lease. Leases can legitimately vary substantially in their content, and we do not want to create a position through legislation whereby a good landlord might find himself in breach of the law because he has omitted some minor detail from the lease.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 156 also deals with the question of a written lease. It avoids the trap that amendment No. 135 falls into. However, to introduce a requirement for a written lease would have significant implications. For example, we should need to consider whether failure to provide a written lease would result in the landlord committing an offence and, if so, what penalty should be levied on him. I do not accept, however, that it is necessary to provide that a lease should comply with the requirements of the Bill—any lease which did not would have no legal force—or that it would not be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0373">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>537</span>
appropriate for the Secretary of State to prescribe terms which have to be in every lease, but I am prepared to look again at the principle of the basic proposal that there should be a written lease.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important to remember that in the law of Scotland a contract of lease is not binding unless it is established by a probative document. It is very unfortunate if that known provision of the common law is not to be a natural practice, because the tenant or the landlord may not know that, under the common law of Scotland, the lease can be insisted on by either party only by a probative document. I know that my honourable Friend knows what a probative document is, but for those who do not, it is a document either signed by the parties or adopted as holograph on their behalf. If we are moving in this area, it is desirable that that sensible tenet of the common law of Scotland should apply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was an important contribution by my honourable and learned Friend. We shall certainly keep that thought in mind. I shall look at the principle of this basic proposal to see whether there should be a written lease and if necessary will come forward with an appropriate amendment at a later stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has made a useful and important concession. Would he be prepared to give an undertaking to advise members of the Committee of the outcome of his consideration, so that we can have fair warning of whether the Government intend to bring forward an amendment on Report?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that if necessary I would come forward with an appropriate amendment at a later stage. I did not say on Report. I shall do my best in that regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to amendments Nos. 137 and 140, honourable Members have argued that, whether or not a written lease is provided, there should be some means of reviewing the terms of a lease after it has been entered into. I regret that I have to disagree with the honourable Member for East Lothian on that. The whole purpose of the Bill is to remove the distortions of the market that arise from the intervention of outside bodies in what should be a free negotiation between landlord and tenant. For the market to be able to operate properly it is essential that the terms of a tenancy, freely negotiated between landlord and tenant, will apply until that tenancy ends, unless both parties agree to change them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards amendment No. 115, I know that Opposition Members have a touching faith in the power of a rent book to control the activities of unscrupulous landlords. However, although rent books are required under existing rent legislation, they are often not provided, and it is impossible to enforce the requirement. It is much more important to provide adequate protection for the tenant against unfair actions by the landlord than to give him the false impression that by having a rent book he is somehow better off. The provisions in the Bill on
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>538</span>
security of tenure and the strengthened protection against harassment and illegal eviction show the Government's commitment to protecting tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nothing in the Bill prevents a landlord issuing his tenant with a rent book, but a rent book provides no information that cannot be provided otherwise. The tenant's right to know his landlord's identity under sections 327 and 328 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 will apply to assured tenants as it does to existing tenants. It is open to tenants, and desirable as a matter of common sense, to obtain a receipt from the landlord for rent paid. We are therefore, not persuaded that imposing a requirement on a landlord to provide a rent book would be of any real benefit to tenants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With constituents like the Minister, who needs enemies? But I am grateful to him for letting the cat out of the bag about what he is trying to achieve here. He said that it would not be right even to allow the courts to interfere with the contracts that may be signed under free negotiations, because he wants the market "to operate properly". I tried to illustrate earlier the type of market that is likely to operate in the foreseeable future. We have a limited number of potential private landlords and an almost unlimited number of people who are desperate for accommodation. If ever there was a recipe for exploitation, that must be it. This is the sort of market that Opposition Members do not want to see operating in an unfettered manner. We wish to include controls. That is why I should be inclined to stick to my guns on amendment No. 140.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have made some headway with written leases on amendment No. 135, and once again it is up to the honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) to decide what he wants to do. It would not be the end of the world if he were to seek to withdraw amendment No. 135, but in the light of what has been said in the debate, and especially in the light of the Minister's alarming comments about free market forces, I am inclined to urge the Committe to vote for amendment No. 140 if and when the opportunity arises.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important to emphasise that we look to the Minister to resolve what is becoming an anomaly, and that is the diminution in the rights of tenants who may want to transfer from their existing public authority tenancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point that I want to raise is in relation to rent books. In the old system under the Rents (Scotland) Act 1984 and previous Acts, the sheriff had a considerable degree of discretion. The tenant had the right to pay the rent up to or after the date of any court hearing and was entitled to ask the court to give him some protection in those circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I read the new proposals, and particularly those contained in schedule 5, as they will be applied by the clause, I am becoming increasingly concerned about the rights that will be taken away from tenants. Ground 12, which is set out in schedule 5, is the authority for the court to order possession in favour of the landlord where rent has not been paid. Contrast the provisions of ground 12, if:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Some rent lawfully due from the tenant—
	<ol>
	<li>is unpaid on the date on which the proceedings for possession are begun; and</li>
	<li>except where subsection (1)(b) of section 19 of this Act applies, was in arrears at the date of the service of the notice under that section relating to those proceedings."</li></ol></p></blockquote>
We have to believe that rent arrears will still be an area where the court has some jurisdiction. We can contrast that with the provisions of the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984 in schedule 2, case 1, which state:
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>540</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where any rent lawfully due from a tenant has not been paid, or any obligation of the protected or statutory tenancy which arises under this Act"</p></blockquote>
has been broken or not performed. The passage continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In determining whether any rent lawfully due from a tenant has been paid in any case where the rent is payable in advance, any sums paid by the tenant in satisfaction of a decree or decrees for rent and expenses shall, if the action in which any such decree was obtained was raised before the expiry of the period in respect of which the rent sued for was due, be imputed wholly to rent and not to expenses."</p></blockquote>
My concern is that the Minister has rejected any suggestion that rent books should be provided in such circumstances. He referred to what I think might be called a token of faith that a tenant might apply to the fact that he holds a rent book. I am concerned that the weakening of tenants' rights, especially in relation to the non-payment of rent or the alleged non-payment of rent, makes the rent book even more imperative. The tenant must have a record of rent payments. If that is not provided by the landlord by some satisfactory measure, it is difficult for the tenant to prove that the rent has been paid. We must take into account that not everyone in Scotland holds a cheque book and can obtain a proper receipt for his rent. I think that the Committee has accepted that not everyone is aware of the law and the need to obtain receipts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been accepted also that there are unscrupulous landlords. It is imperative that the Government examine the clause and find a satisfactory means of imposing an obligation on landlords to provide some receipt, not necessarily a rent book. Where it will be easier to evict tenants for non-payment of rent, we must consider carefully the measure of protection that we are providing for them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We regard the 1988 version of assured tenancies as an unwelcome and potentially sinister new feature on the Scottish housing scene. We shall have further opportunities to discuss details of the arrangements. The Government are abusing the term "assurance". The assurance that is built into the system of assured tenancies will be hard to recognise by many tenants. All the assurances are there for the benefit of the landlord. The tenants will face a rather doubtful future if they fall into this trap. The Government are deliberately and openly breaching the principle of rent controls. Indeed, they are making a virtue of that proposal. This must be bad news for tenants in Scotland. They are deliberately undermining the security of tenure available to tenants under existing legislation. So-called assured tenants will have some security during the term of their assured tenancy, but at the end of it it will be all too easy for landlords to get rid of them. Worst of all, the Government have resisted our suggestion that there should be a registration system to ensure that unscrupulous landlords can be kept out of this potentially fruitful field.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the first instance in the Bill of the Government undermining tenants' rights. The Government might try to wriggle out of that, but we are being asked to pass a Bill that will undermine the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0375">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>541</span>
established privileges of Scottish tenants. As the Minister has said, Scottish Homes tenants will still be covered by the secure tenancy legislation, but anyone who chooses, or is more likely forced into, the assured tenancy system will find himself in a trap. It might suit some short-term tenants—we know that there is a peripheral area in the let housing sector where that may be acceptable—but I fear that, for anyone who wants to set up home for his or her family, the assured tenancy system proposed by the Government could spell an insecure and expensive future, and not the kind of thing which I want my constituents to get themselves into.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have made it clear that they want people to transfer into the private sector. Why they should want to do so under these circumstances I find hard to understand. Otherwise, the only possible movement that will be caused by the Bill is for people to move out of local authority tenure into direct tenancies of Scottish Homes. There must be a distnict possibility that Scottish Homes will grow and grow into a great centralised public sector landlord. I do not think that the Government want that to happen, but I cannot imagine that anyone will be much attracted by the prospect of moving into assured tenancies under private landlords or even, sadly, under housing associations. The Minister has so far failed to address himself to that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If people move into assured tenancies, either under housing associations or, as the Government hope, under private landlords, they will lose their present security of tenure and rent restrictions. Perhaps most interestingly, they will lose the precious right to buy, by which the Government set such store, and the Minister has been trailing us on that subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ministers and Conservative Members have a great deal to say about the importance of the right to buy at a discount. As I understand it, anyone who moves out of the public sector into the private rented sector under the Bill will lose his or her right to buy. The Minister may be able to say otherwise, but I doubt it. If he does say anything different at this stage, it will be news to people in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand what the Government are setting out to do in view of the precedents set over the past few years in England. I understand their belief, at least according to the totality of Conservative philosophy, that there is some merit in moving in the direction of assured tenancies or the like to try to stimulate and bring on stream accommodation at present locked up in the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that it will work in Scotland for a variety of reasons. The tradition of Scottish housing is not fertile ground for an initiative of this sort. That is a question of fact: it will be either right or wrong.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>542</span>
We shall see as much enthusiasm in Scotland as there has been in England; in fact there will probably be even less enthusiasm in Scotland for this sort of device in the private rented sector than there has been in England, in which case the Government are bound to be disappointed. The new provisions and opportunities will not contribute to any significant extent during the next five or 10 years in Scottish housing provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried, and continued to be worried after listening to the debates, about several issues. We have rehearsed them long enough, but security of tenure is still a considerable worry to me. Having practised in the sheriff courts, I consider it a retrograde step that we are to withdraw the provision of giving the sheriff the discretion of the test of reasonability under section 40(18)(2) of the 1987 Act. There could also be a heavy price to pay in the tendency to get increased rents, especially against the background of the housing benefit cuts which will come this April. Those will not be the last of the cuts that we shall see, for if the philosophy of the Government is allowed to run its course for the three or four years of this Parliament—indeed, if we were so unfortunate as to stay under the regime of this Administration for a further Parliament—that would lead to—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under this Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would put me off. The tendency and philosophy of the Prime Minister and social security Ministers will inevitably mean that, if anything, there will be further housing benefit cuts. That, taken together with the tendency to increase rents, will lead to hardship in two groups, for whom the Bill does nothing: first, the homeless; and, secondly, elderly people in constituencies like mine who live in the private rented sector at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wanted to ask the honourable Gentleman whether, with his views of the purity of the law of Scotland, which I fully endorse, and also those of, the honourable Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran), he would think it proper that leases of less than a year's duration should not be subject to his amendment. According to the present law of Scotland, leases of under a year are not subject to probative requirements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a sensible contribution. I would be prepared to consider it carefully. It is true that they are not subject to probative conditions if they are under a year long, and we could consider the matter at an appropriate stage in the Committee. The difficulties faced by people who have no home at all, and by the elderly population in the private rented sector, will cause increased worry and hardship under the provisions of the new assured tenancies. As I have in relation to earlier amendments, the remomval of the rights of arbitration and appeal on the rents in both categories, homelessness and the elderly, could have an onerous impact on the position in Scotland. Although I can see some logic to the proposal, I do not think it will help. It could make matters worse.

Knowing that he is a compassionate man at heart, I ask the Minister to give the Committee an undertaking that, if the Bill is passed without substantial amendment, and we are given a system of assured tenancies as contained in the Bill, he will monitor it carefully for the first few years to make sure that some of the fears expressed by Opposition Members are not borne out to the extent that we believe they will. I shall be happy to be told by him that he told me so, and that I have been unduly pessimistic and worried about the Bill's provisions, as long as he can give me an assurance that he will not only keep a close eye on monitoring the impact of the new system of assured tenancies, but that if he believes that there is any evidence that the things Opposition Members have been talking about are coming to pass, he will take urgent steps to remedy them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>7 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) made many points in relation to schedule 5, which we shall discuss thoroughly when we reach it. He asked about monitoring the effects of the Bill and keeping it under review. We have our own best assessment of how this will work in practice, but we will keep an eye on the effects of the statutory provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So will we.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No doubt the honourable Gentleman will do so, too. The honourable Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) asked about the rent book. I repeat what I said: it is highly desirable for tenants, as a matter of common sense, to obtain a receipt from the landlord for rent paid. The honourable Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) said that tenants' rights would be undermined. That is not so. Tenants will be protected against unlawful eviction. Their rights in that respect will be greatly increased, as will their right to compensation in those circumstances, and assured tenants will have security of tenure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tenants of Scottish Homes will retain their right to buy. The honourable Gentleman also mentioned controls are necessary. He suggested that controls were necessary to protect the tenant in his weaker position. It is precisely the extent of the controls which deter—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the tenant of a new town development corporation sought a transfer to Scottish Homes, would that tenant retain the right to buy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, he certainly would; but if he transferred to a new housing association, he would not. The reason is that it is much less easy for private finance to come in if the houses concerned could readily be sold. It is a practical provision. All existing rights remain in force, and existing housing association tenants who have the right to purchaser will continue to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>544</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the English legislation which is at present in Committee have a different provison?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may be, but this provision is not identical to the English Bill in every respect, although the broad thrust of the proposals is similar, as the honourable Member for Aberdeen, South said. I suggest to the honourable Member for East Lothian that the controls deter good landlords and reduce the supply, opeing the door for bad landlords to move in. Because of the controls, well-intentioned though they were, the tenant is now in a weak negotiating position. As part II begins to succeed, that will change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will go quickly through the purpose of the clause. It lays the foundation for the assured tenancy regime. It is the clause on which the rest of part II is constructed. The most striking fact about the history of private housing in Scotland since 1945 is its steady decline. In 1947, it accounted for 65 per cent. of Scotland's total housing stock.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They were slums.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be that in the past there were a substantial number of slums. That is why improvement grants have been so important in recent years, and have reduced the figure substantially. In 1986, the figure was 6.3 per cent., with housing associations providing a further 2.2 per cent. That dramatic reduction in the number of houses available for private rent reflects in large part the notable increase in the provision of public sector housing and, more recently, the welcome growth in owner-occupation encouraged by the highly successful right-to-buy policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there is no doubt that the continuing decline of private rented housing has been accelerated by various attempts at rent control, which began in 1915 when the first rent restrictions were introduced. The present system of rent control dates from 1965, when the Labour Government reintroduced rent control with the system of "fair rents", and conferred security of tenure on tenants of unfurnished lettings. Those provisions were extended to furnished lettings in 1974, and the same system of control has operated ever since.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The legislation on rent control was consolidated in the rent (Scotland) Act 1986, and it is that system that part II of the Bill seeks to phase out. I avoid the word "abolish" because the present system of rent regulation will continue to apply to tenancies created before the commencement of the new legislation. That is an important difference from the decontrol measures in 1957. Regulated tenancies will, of course, decline in number as time goes on, and in that way the old system will gradually disappear. In its place the new regime to be established by part II of the Bill will apply to an increasing number of new tenancies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why do we need a new regime for the private rented sector? It is because the system of regulated rents has worked against tenants' long-term interests.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0377">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>545</span>
It was based on a one-sided view of the relationship between landlord and tenant. It fixed on the immediate interests of the tenant, but ignored the natural and legitimate desire of the landlord to make a reasonable return on his property. Fair rents have often denied landlords what they would regard as a reasonable return, with the result that many properties have been withdrawn from the rental market, and have been either sold or simply left empty, while many of the properties that remained in the rental market have been neglected by their owners and allowed to fall into disrepair. In the long run, therefore, the system of rent control has caused the private rented sector to shrink.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is needed is a new recognition of both the essential interests of landlord and tenant and their commonality of interest. The landlord should have the right to obtain a reasonable return from letting his property, and to regain possession of his property only when he has reasonable grounds for doing so. The tenant should have the right to fair treatment and security of tenure under the protection of the law. Landlords and tenants everywhere have a common interest in an efficient private rented sector where the supply of accommodation meets the demand. The new regime proposed in part II has been designed with all those interests in mind, and with the main objective of stimulating an increase in the supply of private rented housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key principles underlying the proposed new regime are that rents will be freely negotiable between landlord and tenant and that the tenant will have security of tenure. It will be based on two new kinds of tenancy, of which the assured tenancy, as described in clause 12, will be the principal type. Clause 12 defines the conditions that, if fulfilled, will give rise to an assured tenancy. I want to emphasise that if the conditions are fulfilled in respect of any tenancy created after the commencement of the legislation, the tenancy will have to be an assured tenancy—whether or not, for example, board or furniture is provided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Bill passes largely intact, how soon thereafter could the Minister bring the provisions of clause 12 and related clauses into effect?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be more or less straight away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The conditions for an assured tenancy, which are prescribed in subsection (1), are that the accommodation in question must be a separate dwelling; that the tenant, or at least one tenant in the case of joint tenants, must be an individual; that the tenant, or at least one tenant in the case of joint tenants, must occupy the accommodation as his only or principal home; and that the tenancy is not excluded from being an assured tenancy by virtue of schedule 4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The assured tenancy proposals, for which clause 12 lays the foundations, offer new hope to private sector tenants. By bringing more property into the private rented market and giving good landlords the incentive to invest in improving their property, the Bill opens up new opportunities for tenant and landlord alike. That will have a substantial effect in dealing with many of the vacant houses in Scotland
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>546</span>
and will inevitably reduce the number of homeless persons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The argument is revolving round the likely role of the private sector in tackling housing in Scotland through the means of the assured tenancy. We can learn something from looking at the role of the private sector in the period before Governments became involved and publicly intervened in housing in Scotland, mainly in the middle years of the 20th century, to subsidise mass local authority housing as the best way to meet housing need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to go back to the late 18th and early 19th centuries, when the pre-war pattern of urban development was established. It was affected by two main factors. One was that the people of Scotland were very poor, as they are today. In Dundee district, for example, more than 60 per cent. of public sector tenants have to depend on handouts to pay their rents. Yet the Minister is continually telling Dundee district council that its rents are too low. He wants more of Dundee's population to be impoverished and pauperised and dependent on housing benefit. He thinks that that is the way forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At that time people could afford only very low rents. Although England had a Poor Law system that dealt with poverty, Scotland did not and had to depend in the main on charity. Many people were therefore unable to cope with emergencies and were reluctant to spend money on housing. The fact that people were poor had to be taken on board. The situation today is similar. Another factor at that time was the effect of the—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I remind the honourable Gentleman that we are debating clause 12 stand part. His arguments are wide of the terms of the clause. He must limit his argument to deal with the clause and nothing but the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a complicated matter, Mr. Lambie, but I shall try to relate my comments directly to the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing with the likely role of the private sector with those who make up the private sector. The last time that it was given a free hand to intervene in the housing market, it made a mess of it. I shall try to relate its activities then to those that will occur under the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I can follow that line of argument, but we do not need to go back to the 18th and 17th centuries. One example at this stage is enough.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Lambie. Would it not be better if the honourable Gentleman related his remarks to a time when his family actually lived in Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order. We are not going back to that type of argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Lambie. If some honourable Members in Committee are dressed for the 19th century, are we not entitled to discuss that period?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1987-1988V011P0I0378">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>547</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are lucky that the honourable and learned Member for Perth and Kinross has only one suit left.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to bring my remarks back to housing, Mr. Lambie.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not housing, but clause 12 please.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, to housing under clause 12 and the role of the private sector. You said that I could use one example, Mr. Lambie, so perhaps I could use the example of the feuing system in Scotland and the way in which it operated in relation to the private sector. The feuing system means that the landlord alienates the land for ever when he feus it out to a property developer, for example in exchange for a down payment and an annual feu duty. Therefore, the landlord has no incentive to ensure that the property built on his land is to the highest possible standard and is not allowed to deterriorate into a slum. His only aim is to ensure that the feu duty is as high as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is unlike the system in England, where long-term recovery of the property is possible, and therefore it is in the landlord's interests to ensure that any property built on the land is to the highest possible standards. As that was not the case in Scotland, it was in the landowner's interest to get as much money as he could, and it was in the property developer's interests to recover the high costs involved by getting as much money as it could from the property built on that land. Therefore, developers had to ensure that they crammed as many tenants as possible into any building that they erected so as to obtain a high return becaus tenants could not afford to pay high rents. Because some big property developers feued out the land to smaller property developers to build on again, it was in the interests of smaller developers, too, to cram in as many people possible as in order to repay bonds borrowed at high interest rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
7.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thus it went on through the years: the developers quickly built properties and then sold them off to the Victorian middle classes, who were also looking for a safe investment and a high return. The middle classes of the day, who were highly respectable, all claimed that the term "good landlords" could be applied to them, but their own self-interest meant that they had no interest in ensuring that tenants were properly looked after. Those are the people who the Prime Minister is constantly asking us to admire and emulate—the Victorians who out of self-interest exploited the working class of Scotland by cramming them into small, mean, overcrowded, insanitary houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will be the role of the middle classes who provide the money for the private sector in Scotland today? If clause 12 stands and assured tenancies are brough in as the means whereby the private sector is to meet housing need in Scotland, the private sector—the landlords and those who provide the housing—will again look only to its own self-interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>548</span>
In these circumstances, it is nothing short of criminal for the Government still further to weaken security of tenure and rent control for tenants. The Minister knows that the private sector will come in only to make a profit, rip people off and see that its own interests rather than those of tenants are looked after.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have a responsibility to the tenants, and it is important that they meet that responsibility by introducing amendments of the kind suggested by the Opposition, which would have protected tenants' interests through written leases and in other ways. The Government have abandoned any pretence of looking after tenants and opened the door to people who are interested only in themselves and their profits and who have no interest in tenants other than to exploit them. The Government are working hand in glove with those people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to the right of landlords to obtain a reasonable return on property. I do not think that anybody would dispute that right, but there is a misconception somewhere in the Minister's mind, or at least in his civil servants' minds. The context in which the Minister put that statement suggests that he does not know much about the private housing sector. My experience of it suggests to me that there is a gold mine out there and that a few people are making a large amount of money. Some of the them are even going out and buying football clubs, as my honurable Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) may be aware.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that in 1987–88 some £5.4 billion was spent on housing benefit in the United Kindom. A substantial proportion of that goes into the private sector in Scotland. A reasonable extrapolation would be about £600 million. That is an awful lot of money and a substantial subsidy to the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, during our debates on the Bill the Minister has confirmed that, far from extending tenants' rights in Scotland, as the Government promised in their White Paper and all the blurb surrounding it, certain tenants will lose the right to attend local authority meetings, although Opposition Members moved an amendment to preserve that right. Secondly, certain tenants who change their landlord will lose the right to a written lease. Thirdly, the Minister has confirmed that certain tenants will lose the right to buy. When will the Government come clean and make public this diminution of rights?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) is straying into part III. We shall deal thoroughly with those points when we come to part III.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already dealt with the right to buy. Many of those of whom we are talking will go to new housing associations. That is why the representations of the Scottish Federation of Housing Assocations are so important and to be taken seriously. The discussions that are taking place will continue. The growth of the housing associations movement is enormously important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are treated to a real spectacle of two nation Toryism from the Minister when he addressed the Committee a few minutes ago. It was a return to the law of the jungle from the minority Conservative Administration in Scotland. The Government want to sweep away the framework of rent controls and tenants' rights starting in 1915, according to the Minister. He wants to wipe the slate clean and start again in the hope of reviving the private rented sector which, as he has acknowledged, has declined to a miserable 6.3 per cent. of Scotland's housing. It is a case of building on failure. There must be genuine anxiety about the sacrifices that the Government will require future tenants to make to get into this kind of tenure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister tried to shrug off the fears that the Opposition have been expressing by saying that there will be protection from unlawful eviction, but he is creating many more grounds for lawful eviction. We can do without that kind of law in Scotland. I do not like the principle of the Government's so-called assured tenancies and I hope that the Committee will vote against clause 12 for that reason, but as the Government will get their way both in the Committee and later I wish to put it on record that the Labour party intends to restore a proper
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>550</span>
framework of security of tenure and rent controls for Scotland. We shall do that either when we form a majority Government in this place or in a Scottish Assembly, but it will certainly be done. Private sector landlords in Scotland would do well to pay heed to that warning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
