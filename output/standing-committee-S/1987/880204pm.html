	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed [this day]:</i> No. 90, in page 2, line 37, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"except that Scottish Homes shall not enter arrangements with a Community Charge levying authority under paragraph 5 of Schedule 2 to the Abolition of Domestic Rates etc (Scotland) Act 1987".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<i>—[Mr. Home Robertson.]</i></p>
	<p>4.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the adjournment I was explaining that the amendment seeks to prevent Scottish Homes from collecting community charge, on behalf of a regional council, from its tenants and their families. This function is no different from that carried out at present by the Scottish Special Housing Association and local housing authorities. They collect rates, along with rents, as a service to tenants and as an assistance to regional councils. That is, of course, a good example of the close co-operation between Scottish Homes and local authorities that Opposition Members were so keen to ensure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that there is a distinction between a property tax, which is the rates, and a personal tax, which is what the poll tax is intended to be?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a different form of local taxation. We heard this morning from the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) about his concerns that Scottish Homes would go beyond that function. He suggested that information held by Scottish Homes, obtained for the purposes of its functions other than as a landlord, could or would be made available for the community charge register. This cannot happen. There is a general principal that information gained under one Act cannot be used for the purposes of another Act. That would preclude Scottish Homes, set up under what will be the Housing (Scotland) Act 1988, from transferring any information gained to the register and those who operate it in the local authority, set up under the Abolition of Domestic Rates Etc. (Scotland) Act 1987. Indeed, to do so would be incompetent and subject to challenge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scottish Homes' function in relation to the community charge will be confined to its collection on behalf of regional councils. I see no grounds for departing from the satisfactory arrangements that have been successfully
	<span class='label label-info column'>414</span>
used up to now, and I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment. Otherwise I must invite the Committee to reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Doran 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am intrigued by the point that the Minister made, that information gained under one Act is precluded from being used by another authority for other purposes. I wonder whether the same applies to the electoral roll.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purposes of the amendment is to take the new Scottish Homes out of the process of collection of the poll tax—or, to suit the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) the charge levied under the Abolition of Domestic Rates Etc. (Scotland) Act 1987. Several points need to be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, there is the question of cost. We are very concerned at the money that is not going into Scottish housing at present. We do not want that to be diluted or reduced any further. I am conscious, for example, that in Aberdeen the cost of collecting the poll tax has been calculated—not estimated—by Grampian regional council at £2 million. That works out at approximately £6.50 per head of population in my constituency, and that is before all the other services that require to be paid for out of that tax are taken into consideration. Who pays? Will it be the local authority, by paying a commission on what is collected, or will it be paid for by the new authority, thereby reducing further the amount of money available to be spent on housing in Scotland?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned also about the arrangement with housing bodies. In may area—I am sure that that goes for the rest of the country—the council has been advised by the Scottish Office, and presumably the Department for which the Minister has responsibility, that the old arrangement whereby the housing authorities simply lump together the rental and rates payments in one payment to the council tenant will no longer apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In future the amount of the poll tax will be specifically identified so that when the person in the household goes along to pay the rent, instead of presenting one book showing the global weekly figure he will have to present the rent book, which will show the rent specifically, and the various vouchers or payment forms for all the individual poll tax payers in the house. Apart from being nonsensical, bureaucratic and a considerable additional imposition on the housewife, who is usually the one who ends up paying the rent, it will be much more confusing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that that is in accord with stated Government policy and philosophy. We cannot escape from the fact that the philosophy behind the poll tax legislation is to make every individual aware of the cost of local government services. We have pointed out in other debates how iniquitous that tax is, but I am concerned about the imposition of this bureaucratic arrangement, apparently on the direct instruction of the Scottish Office, and the effect that it will have on the administration of Scottish Homes. How will it cope with the various payments? It is not a post office or a bank—it is a housing authority. We need to be clear what arrangements the Minister is proposing and what bureaucratic structure Scottish Homes will have to develop to cope with the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Abhorrent though the philosophy behind the poll tax is, our proposal that Scottish Homes should not collect the poll tax is in line with the Government's philosophy. Scottish Homes is identified as the housing authority, which will be required to collect the rent. If the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0308">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>415</span>
Government's philosophy is followed through, there is no necessity to force the housing authority to collect poll tax. If the Government want to impress on every housewife, every worker, every student and every pensioner in Scotland how expensive local authority services are and to establish a link between payment for services and the way in which the individual votes, they should insist that each individual turns up at the local authority headquarters to pay the poll tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is totally in line with and consistent with Government thinking. No matter how opposed I am to that thinking, it strikes me that there is an inconsistency in the Minister's brief. Perhaps he will check with his civil servants and see whether he can say something different.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I congratulate you, Mr. Lambie, on making sure that we now have a copy of the Abolition of Domestic Rates Etc. (Scotland) Act 1987. Before lunch, we were limited in what we could do because we did not have a copy available to us. I was somewhat misled by the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson), who kept referring to an Act of which I had never heard. More important, he kept referring to a particular part of an Act of which I had never heard. He kept referring to schedule 2, paragraph 5. Because the Act was not available, I could not get to grips with the matter. When one reads paragraph 5 of schedule 2 to that Act, one realises that the amendment would prevent Scottish Homes from having any discussions because it says that Scottish Homes shall not enter into "arrangements". What "arrangements' means I do not know—it can mean one thing to some people and something quite different to others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman has had such difficulty in understanding the amendment. It was tabled about three weeks ago and has been on the amendment paper ever since. The hon. Gentleman would have had sufficient notice if he had bothered to look at the amendment paper. The arrangements are precisely those referred to in subparagraph (2) of paragraph 5 of schedule 2 to the Abolition of Domestic Rates Etc. (Scotland) Act 1987.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am astonished by that. The hon. Gentleman kept making reference to a non-existent Act—a "poll tax Act". If reference is made to an Act of Parliament and to sections or schedules of that Act, Members of the Committee can expect the Act to be available in the Committee Room, so that the provisions concerned can be inspected in detail. The hon. Gentleman must be aware that it is incumbent on the Clerk to ensure that all relevant documents are made available to any Committee studying legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that right?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman checks, he will find that the rules and conventions covering Standing Committee procedure require that the Committee should have available all relevant Government documents and all relevant pieces of legislation, including any Acts to which amendments make direct reference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is incumbent on all hon. Members with a modicum of
	<span class='label label-info column'>416</span>
intelligence to plan ahead and ensure that they have before them any Acts that they think will be useful and to look at the Bill to see what other Acts are affected by it. There has been a certain amount of what the Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth), would doubtless describe as call feather-bedding in this Committee, with the provision of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987, the Rent Acts and other earlier Acts. There is a vast library in the corner of the room. Indeed, I should have thought that it would not be too much effort for the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) to stroll along to the Library itself—I will give him a map of how to get there—or go down to the Vote Office, where he can pick up any Acts that he wants. The Clerk to the Committee has far more valuable things to do than spoon-feed the hon. Gentleman. It is asking too much and would be a further imposition beyond the £6 to which my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) has already alluded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am always fascinated, as I am sure you must be, Mr. Lambie, by the zeal and zest of the new boys, but how quickly it vanishes when they have spent some time in Committee and realise that the pressures on their valuable time are such that we need the necessary equipment to do our job effectively. If the hon. Gentleman thinks that I do not do my homework carefully—that is the impression that I get from what he has just said—I look forward to future debates and to a time when the hon. Gentleman is without the relevant documentation and has to call for it. I have a long memory and I shall not forget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall return to amendment No. 90, Mr. Lambie, because I can see that you are about to tell me, quite properly, that I should not respond to interventions which do not relate to the amendment. I was interested in what the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) said because it was important and relevant. If I understood him correctly, he said that his authority was concerned that the cost of collection was to be about £1.50 a head.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was £6.50.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like all hon. Members, we should be interested in the cost of any operation. I am interested because I should like to know what the average costs are throughout Scotland and which authorities have the necessary equipment to do the job in the most cost-effective way. I have asked questions of my hon. Friends the Treasury Ministers, to which I have not yet had answers, about the type of equipment that has been ordered, the use to which it will be put and whether authorities are collaborating to find the most cost-effective way of doing it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment says that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Scottish Homes shall not enter arrangements with a Community Charge levying authority".</p></blockquote>
In other words, it would prevent Scottish Homes from having any meaningful negotiations—arrangements—with any of the levying authorities. That does not seem to be a practical or sensible provision to write into statute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to relate my remarks specifically to the amendment. I share the concern of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0309">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>417</span>
hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) about the pressures on the time not only of individual members but of the Committee. We should spend less time arguing about whether certain Acts are available in the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 5(1) of schedule 2 to the Abolition of Domestic Rates Etc. (Scotland) Act 1987 is specific. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Subject to sub-paragraph (3) below, a levying authority may make arrangements with a housing body for the exercise by the housing body on behalf of the levying authority of any of the authority's functions under this Schedule."</p></blockquote>
I think that the Minister will concede that Scottish Homes can be considered to be a housing body and therefore to be covered by the Act. It could therefore be asked to issue poll tax demand notices, for example, for the 83,000 SSHA tenants that it takes over together with any other tenants who come under its auspices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister himself drew attention to the fact that the SSHA already collected the rates through rent payments, but that agreement was mutually and cordially entered into between district councils and the SSHA. It was also convenient for the tenants to pay their rates with the rents, so there was no problem about that. Everyone was satisfied with the arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That will not be the case with the poll tax. As my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) fairly pointed out, the poll tax is not like the rates. No one householder will pay the rates for the whole house. Every individual in the house will have to pay his or her poll tax. Nor will one member of the household be able to make five or six different payments with the rent. Each person will have to go to Scottish Homes and pay his or her individual poll tax. One cheque cannot cover five or six different poll taxes. For instance, in my house only my wife and I will be liable to pay the poll tax. The children are too young as yet, although I would not put it past the Government to levy poll tax on children as well. I cannot sign one cheque for the two of us. My wife has to sign a separate cheque. Children have to pay separately from their parents. A cheque from one person will constitute payment only of that person's poll tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A large administrative burden will thus be placed on Scottish Homes. It will need special officers to collect the poll tax, not from 83,000 tenants but from 83,000 households. As many as 240,000 people in Scottish Homes houses will be liable to pay the poll tax and will have to go to Scottish Homes to pay the tax individually month by month. Like any other body for which the Government are responsible, Scottish Homes will have a limited amount of cash. The Minister is suggesting that part of that cash should be used to collect the poll tax. That seems to me to be nonsense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 5(1) of schedule 2 to the 1987 Act goes on to say that any of the functions of the levying authority described in the schedule can be carried out by Scottish Homes. That includes receiving appeals against demand notices. If Scottish Homes issues a demand notice telling the people in one of its houses how much poll tax they have to pay, those people have the right to appeal to Scottish Homes against that demand. Scottish Homes will have to set up an appeals procedure to deal with
	<span class='label label-info column'>418</span>
people complaining about the amount of poll tax levied on them. Moreover, if tenants not satisfied with the decision reached by Scottish Homes on their appeal, they can then appeal to the sheriff court over the heads of Scottish Homes. Scottish Homes would then have to go to the sheriff court and reply to the appeal. It will therefore have yet another administrative duty which has nothing to do with housing and will not help to tackle the housing crisis in Scotland but will take up the valuable time of Scottish Homes officers and professional employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The absurd situation then arises whereby if the levying authority and Scottish Homes fail to reach agreement ort the terms under which Scottish Homes takes over the levying authority's poll tax functions they can go to the Secretary of State for Scotland to arbitrate between them and to enforce an agreement. There can be no question of real arbitration in those circumstances. While a regional council, which is likely to be the levying authority, is distinct from the Secretary of State for Scotland—indeed, it is likely to be under Labour control and to have a very different view of the poll tax from the Secretary of State for Scotland—Scottish Homes will not be independent of the Secretary of State for Scotland. It will be the lackey of the Secretary of State for Scotland, so in no sense can he arbitrate in a disagreement between the two bodies. He is on one side of the argument all the time and will persistently find in favour of Scottish Homes and against the levying authority, the regional council. It goes without saying that he can also require Scottish Homes to accept the arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not simply a question of the functions laid down in paragraph 5 of schedule 2 to the 1987 Act. Under section 17 of the Act the community charge registration officer has a general duty
	<br><blockquote><p>"to take all reasonable steps to obtain such information as is reasonably required by him"</p></blockquote>
in relation to registration. What kind of information could be reasonably required by the community charges registration officer? He will certainly want to know who is in a house at any given time so that he can track people down and put them on the register. He will want to know about the financial circumstances of the people in the house, whether they are in employment and in receipt of wages, whether they would qualify for a rebate scheme which is still to be decided on by the Government. Such information will have to be available, if not to the registration officer at least to the levying authority. He will also want to know who is responsible under the 1987 Act for completing the register, and such information will have to be supplied to him by various bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 17 of the Act goes on to say that the registration officer may require any housing body
	<br><blockquote><p>"to supply him with such information as he may reasonably require in connection with his functions, being information which … the housing body have in connection with any of their functions; and the … housing body shall comply with such a requirement."</p></blockquote>
The Minister tried to pretend earlier that Scottish Homes would not be subject to that part of the Abolition of Domestic Rates Etc. (Scotland) Act, but it seems clear that the registration officer can require housing bodies to supply him with information that he needs to compile the community charges register. That means that Scottish Homes as a housing body will be included in that part of the Act and will have to supply to the registration officer such information as he may require.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0310">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>419</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If, for example, Scottish Homes were to give a grant to an owner-occupier, that kind of information could not be imparted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister knows that there are other kinds of information which Scottish Homes will be required to give the community charges registration officer about its tenants, information which could well bring it into conflict with its tenants. That is the point that I am trying to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, the registration officer will want to know the number of people in each house. The Minister of State, the hon. Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale (Mr. Lang), has written to me personally on this point. He says that there is no way that the electoral register will be used for such purposes. I would dispute that. It seems from what the Minister is saying that if he is not to use the electoral register he may use a body, such as Scottish Homes to find out how many people live in a certain house.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whether or not the Minister intends to use the register for that purpose, my constituents certainly believe that that is how the register will be used. Between the election last June and the drawing up of the draft register, I have lost some 5,000 voters from the register. Clearly, the public believe that the register will be used as the register for poll tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. Although the registration officer is not required to use the electoral register, the community charges registration officer in Tayside admits that it will be one of the base documents used to compile the separate community charges register. At the same time, while it may not be compulsory to use the register, if a person wants to stay off the community charges register he will have to make sure that he is not on the electoral register because a person who is on the electoral register cannot avoid being on the community charges register. Scottish Homes will be expected to supply information to the community charges registration officer about its tenants. It will be expected to spy on its own tenants. I can think of circumstances in which that would be very unfortunate and could lead to conflict between tenants and Scottish Homes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Section 17(2) of the 1987 Act says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The registration officer shall for the purpose of discharging his functions under this Act have access to and the use of any information which the assessor or electoral registration officer for the area which comprises or includes the registration area of the registration officer may have acquired in connection with any of his functions."</p></blockquote>
Therefor, the Act specifically requires the poll tax officer to consult the electoral register.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is only Ministers who deny that simple fact that the electoral register will be used and that people will choose not to vote so as to avoid the poll tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us take a family of four or five adults who are tenants of Scottish Homes, where the sons and daughters are over 18 but still at home and all on social security benefit. I assume that the Government will argue that their benefits will be uprated to take account of their contribution to the poll tax. The uprating exercise will
	<span class='label label-info column'>420</span>
take place not only in Scotland but throughout the United Kingdom, and the uprating amounts will be decided nationally. I forget the exact figure, but about £1.40 a week will be given to people on benefit to help them pay their poll tax. The family, may live in Dundee, Glasgow or Edinburgh. When the poll tax for that area is assessed, it may be well in excess of £1.40 a week. Members of that family may be required to pay £5 per week in poll tax, so they will be £3.60 down already. Where will people on social security benefit find the £3.60 necessary to meet their 20 per cent. responsibility for the poll tax? They will not be able to do it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sons and daughters in that house might be even worse off. Because of an emergency, they may have to apply to the new social fund for a loan to buy an essential item. That loan has to be paid back to the social fund at a rate of 15 per cent. of benefit every week, so they may already be losing 15 per cent. of their benefit that way. They are then hit by the poll tax, towards which they are given only £1.40 although £5 has been demanded. Any person in those circumstances would seek to avoid being liable for poll tax. He would seek to come off the electoral register so as to ensure that he was not on the community charges register. No member of the Committee could attack people in those circumstances for trying to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is suggesting that Scottish Homes should spy on such people and say, "We know that five people are living in that house, not two as the returns to the registration officer show, so we shall inform on the other three." Is the Minister seriously saying that it is any basis for good landlord-tenant relations for the landlord to become a state spy, just like the spy working for the group that was highlighted on television earlier this week, which spies on trade unionists and then reports them to their employers?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The levying authority will be responsible for finding out about people's financial circumstances. If it applies to Scottish Homes for information, will Scottish Homes give it? Scottish Homes will have access to details of its tenants' financial circumstances through the housing benefit system, so it will have information which the levying authority may require. Will Scottish Homes give the levying authority that financial information, which was given to Scottish Homes on a confidential basis? Will Scottish Homes betray that confidence and give information to another body without its tenants' permission or even without their knowledge? Is that what the Minister is suggesting?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The registration officer will also have to decide who is the responsible person in the house for making the poll tax returns. There may be disputes within the household about who should be the responsible person because there could be serious consequences for that person. If Scottish Homes tells the registration officer the name on the rent book, that information could be used by the registration officer against that person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.00 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister seems to be suggesting that Scottish Homes should be in permanent conflict with its own tenants and regarded by them as a spy, a body which conducts itself against their interests and in the interests of what they see as their enemy—the state and the Government, particularly the present Tory Government.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0311">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>421</span>
That is a sad situation and one that the Minister should do his best to prevent. This is a highly contentious party-political issue, and it is quite wrong for the Minister to try to involve Scottish Homes in that kind of in-fighting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's right honourable Friend the Prime Minister has stated that the poll tax is the flagship of her new policies and the new Government. We all hope that it will be a case of sink of swim—in her case, very much sink—but it featured prominently in Scotland in the general election campaign. I tried to remind the Secretary of State for Scotland of that fact in the recent debate on Scotland. He had claimed in an interview in 	<i>The Scotsman</i> that Tory candidates in the election were besieging him and saying, "Don't listen to the moaning Minnies who say that the poll tax is not popular because it is popular and everywhere we go in Scotland we get a marvellous reception." The Tories got a marvellous reception all right—10 or 11 of them were kicked out of their seats and the rest disappeared altogether.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I ask the hon. Gentleman to get back to the amendment and not to concern himself with the poll tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the point that I am trying to make, Mr. Lambie. This is a highly contentious political issue. In seeking to defeat the amendment, the Minister is trying to drag Scottish Homes into a party-political issue in which it should have no part. There is a genuine revulsion against this tax in Scotland. The putative tenants of Scottish Homes are very much against it. The Minister seems to be saying that, in the face of intense political opposition in Scotland, he is prepared to drag Scottish Homes into the political fight on the side of the minority—those who support the poll tax and the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister is genuinely anxious to give Scottish Homes the best possible start and to ensure that it can contribute to tackling the housing crisis and take in housing the role that the SDA plays in the economy, he should accept the amendments. Otherwise, Scottish Homes will be tainted as a Tory agency, which can only lead to resentment, opposition and eventually the breakdown of the system proposed in the Bill. I advise the Minister to agree to the amendment and to take Scottish Homes out of the political in-fighting over the poll tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend should not describe the poll tax as controversial. It is not controversial. There is virtual a unanimity in Scotland that it is absurd, a bad thing and totally unaccceptable. If that was the flagship of the Tory party in Scotland, it was sunk with most hands on 11 June. A great deal of water will flow down the Tay before the poll tax comes into effect. Speaking purely personally, I have no intention of willingly complying with any part of that legislation, and I have no doubt that that goes for many others. I suspect that the Government will run into a little more bother with it before they have finished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I keep trying to put on the record matters which are of interest to all members of the Committee and probably to other hon. Members too. We could be making rapid progress through the Bill. Negotiations have been going on, and it would be possible for the Committee to proceed rapidly, dispose of clause 2 tonight, and then finish the
	<span class='label label-info column'>422</span>
remainder of part I so that we can get to grips with part II, the nitty-gritty of the Bill, on Tuesday. But we are in some difficulty, because the Government refuse to give any undertaking on what time we are to adjourn tonight. I live in hope that the usual channels will start functioning and that we shall be able to conduct ourselves in a civilised way, as most Members of the Committee wish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister sought to assure the Committee that it was not the Government's intention, or a condition of the legislation, that Scottish Homes should furnish information to the poll tax registration authority, which was not strictly appropriate for it to do. In moving the amendment I argued that it was not at all appropriate that a housing body, a landlord, and giver of grants and support to owner-occupiers, tenants and private landlords, should be involved in the business of assisting the personal taxation system in this country. It would be entirely improper for the SSHA, the Housing Corporation or a district council to be involved in furnishing information to the income tax authorities on people's personal taxation circumstances. Similarly, we argue that it is not proper for Scottish Homes to do that in relation to the poll tax. The Minister said that there would be a limitation on the requirement on Scottish Homes to furnish such information. It has become clear in the course of this debate that the Government intend Scottish Homes to be treated as a housing body under the terms of the poll tax legislation. I quote again, not from the assurances given by the Minister in Committee which have not the force of law, but from the text of the Abolition of Domestic Rates Etc. (Scotland) Act 1987. Section 17(3) provides:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Subject to subsection (4) below, the registration officer may require … any housing body in his registration area, to supply him with such information as he may reasonably require in connection with his functions, being information which the … housing body have in connection with any of their functions; and the … housing body shall comply with such a requirement."</p></blockquote>
"Any of their functions" is the relevant phrase—any information that the poll tax officer wants to get his hands on, the housing body may be required by law to furnish to him. The ministerial assurance is not worth much on that one. A poll tax officer will be able to go to Scottish Homes and say, "I want the details of applications for improvement grants, because that will tell us what the available accommodation is in those houses; I also require information about how many tenants there are, and who is claiming housing benefit, in a particular estate so that we can find out who should be put on the poll tax register."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The poll tax registration officer, if he is zealous and enthusiastic about his job, might well look for information from those other sources, and by law the housing body will be required to furnish the information. It is no good the Minister saying that it would not happen, because it can happen. His assurance is not worth the paper that it will be printed on. We are getting into a rather sinister world, where a landlord—a public sector landlord at that—might be required to furnish that sort of information about his tenants and their households, to people administering a personal taxation system. This is an abusive power. As my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) has said, it is an inappropriate and unsatisfactory way in which to launch the Scottish Homes organisation. We should like to see it set up in an atmosphere of good will and common sense,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0312">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>423</span>
but if one of its first jobs is to be connected with imposing this hated system in Scotland, it will start on the wrong foot and become involved in friction and aggravation with its own tenants and those whom it should want to serve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances, unless the Minister can say something more conciliatory, I shall not seek leave to withdraw the amendment and I hope that the Committee will accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In answer to the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) who is temporarily absent, section 17 of the Abolition of Domestic Rates Etc. (Scotland) Act 1987 deals with the duty concerning registration. On the question of the assessing officer and the registration officer being the same person, he can use information obtained in one capacity for the other. That is specifically stated in section 17(2) of the Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also raised the question of the cost of collection of the community charge. That is a relevant point. The cost will be taken into account in assessing the grant in aid paid to Scottish Homes. The function to be carried out will be no different from that carried out at present by local authorities and the SSHA. They collect rates with rents, both as a service to tenants and as an assistance to regional councils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is totally misleading the Committee by seeking to draw an exact parallel between people paying rent and rates to the SSHA and people being obliged to pay the poll tax separately and individually to the new Scottish Homes housing agency. As people in Scotland oppose the poll tax and regard it as being undemocratically imposed on them, it will lead unavoidably to conflict between Scottish Homes and its tenants. That situation does not exist between the SSHA and its tenants over the paying of rates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The same system of collection will be continued.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm whether his office or civil servants under his control have given instructions along the lines indicated in my contribution to the debate? Are they insisting that local authorities collect the poll tax separately from rental payments? Will separate vouchers be issued, and will they require to be exhibited when payments are made? If so, the Minister is wrong to say that it is the same system of collection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must take that up with my hon. Friend the Minister of State, the Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale (Mr. Lang)</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Schedule 5(1) of the Abolition of Domestic Rates etc. (Scotland) Act 1987 reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Subject to sub-paragraph (3) below, a levying authority may make arrangements with a housing body for the exercise by the housing body on behalf of the levying authority of any of the authority's functions under this Schedule."</p></blockquote>
The word used was "may", not "shall". Parliament decided that housing bodies may be required by a levying authority to collect the community charge, and that is provided for in that schedule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Section 5(1) of that Act deals with water and sewerage charges.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is schedule 2(5)(1). In answer to the question of the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South on the procedures for collecting the community charge, the SSHA has devised procedures for collecting rates and rents. Similar procedures would need to be developed to ensure that Scottish Homes would be enabled to collect community charges with rents. I see no good reason for departing from those arrangements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That answer was a disgrace. The Minister started by asserting that exactly the same kind of system was operated at present between the SSHA and its tenants. Under questioning from the Opposition, he then conceded that he did not know whether it was the same system and said that we should refer the matter to his hon. Friend the Minister of State, the hon. Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale (Mr. Lang), who is disgracefully absent from the Committee when we are dealing with a subject about which he allegedly has expertise and on which he could answer our questions.

The Minister is treating the Committee with contempt. Ministers mislead the Committee by saying things that are not true. Then they say that they do not know, but will write to us. They then ask us to speak to another Minister who is not in the Committee. The way they treat the Committee is a disgrace. It is time that they gave answers in the Committee, not promises to write to us later. The Minister should withdraw his statement that it is exactly the same kind of system as that of the SSHA.

I seek your guidance about how to raise points of order and relate them to what is in order and the difference that occurs with regard to hon. Members being responsible, as you rightly said, for their speeches. You must explain to Opposition Members who are not aware of it that you are in no way responsible for what any hon.

I am a new Member of Parliament; if anyone had told me before I came to the House that we should be making laws in this ludicrous fashion, I should not have believed it.

Gentleman for calling him Lord John.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You raised my hopes, Mr. Lambie. We may not have the Minister of State with us who is directly responsible for the poll tax, but here comes the right hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Rifkind)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And learned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We shall find out whether he knows about the relationship between housing bodies and the administration of poll tax. I sympathise with my hon. Friend. All hon. Members knew that there was to be a debate in the Committee at this time about the relationship between housing bodies and the poll tax. The hon. Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale (Mr. Lang) is a member of the Committee; he has been present at a number of its sittings, yet, curiously although he is the Minister supposedly responsible for poll tax in Scotland, he has significantly absented himself from the Committee.

But even if he is not here, perhaps I as the Scottish official majority spokesman in the Committee can assist my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galloway) by referring once again to the statute relating to poll tax which was forced through by people who subsequently lost their seats in the last election. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) read from the schedule selectively. He said that the arrangements with housing bodies, which we are debating—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This debate started with a question from the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South whether the community charge would be identified separately from the rent levels. I shall have to check and confirm this, but to the best of my knowledge it is likely that they will be identified separately. I must confirm that, but that is the detailed point to which the hon. Member wanted an answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I give way to my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister made a statement after conferring with his right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State. Presumably he can confer once more with his right hon. and learned Friend to determine whether such an instruction has gone from the Scottish Office. We can clear up the point and we shall not need to wait until a letter is written or another delaying tactic is used. They can confer again. I am sure that my hon. Friends will be happy to give them time to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My understanding is that the poll tax is supposed to be administered at arm's length
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0314">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>427</span>
from rent collection. Presumably separate accounts will be sent out and there will be a separate machinery; this is the cause of much of the initial bureaucracy created by the new form of taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West was seeking to allay fears aroused during the debate that Scottish Homes, or any other body, could be required to enter into arrangements with the poll tax administration to collect the tax or furnish information. He said that it was not a requirement, but a permissive provision and that arrangements could be entered into by agreement between a housing body and the poll tax authorities. He cited the relevant words of schedule 2(5). If he had gone a little further, he would have found that subparagraph (6) says
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where the Secretary of State is satisfied that a levying authority wish to make arrangements under sub-paragraph (1) above with a housing body but the housing body have not agreed to enter into them, he may, by regulations made after consultation with the levying authourity and the housing body, require the housing body to do so."</p></blockquote>
Even now, a district council that does not want to play ball with the poll tax operation can drag its feet. To their great credit, a number of district councils in Scotland are doing so and have stated that they do not intend to co-operate willingly with this pernicious legislation. But under regulations which the Government can—and no doubt will—bring in, those district councils can be compelled to hand over the information about their tenants and their households. There is at least some scope for debating the issue. In the case of Scottish Homes, which will be a creature of the Secretary of State for Scotland and nominated by him, there will be no such scope for debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West or the Secretary of State instructs Scottish Homes to co-operate fully with the poll tax authorities in the collection of information and of the tax in due course, it will be required to do so. There is no nonsense about it. Any suggestion that there will be shortcuts or any way round the problem is misleading. The Minister knows that, as do all hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I reiterate that it is quite wrong for a housing body to be directly involved in investigations and in the collection of a personal tax. Just as it would be wrong to expect district councils to furnish information to the Inland Revenue for the purpose of income tax, so it is wrong for Scottish Homes to be involved in furnishing information and collecting poll gax. That is not its job. It is not appropriate, and it is wrong for Parliament to seek to impose that duty on such bodies. I shall stick to my guns. The Committee should accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is most unsatisfactory. The Committee is considering an amendment that would exclude Scottish Homes from entering into arrangements with the levying authorities to collect the community charge, or poll tax. The Minister began his argument that no such exclusion should be enacted by saying that Scottish Homes should be allowed to enter into an arrangement on the basis that the same kind of system was operated by the SSHA at present. He said that the SSHA collected rent and rates together. Everyone would agree with that. SSHA tenants probably do not know what proportions they pay in rates and rents. They only know that that is what they pay for being an SSHA tenant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>428</span>
As the argument developed on both sides of the Committee, the Minister changed his position to say that he did not know if it was the same system. He did not know whether the poll tax would be lumped in with the rent or levied separately, or whether, if it was to be levied separately, it would be on an individual basis for every person living in the house. That is a different system from that which is currently operated by the SSHA. The Minister said that he did not know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the arrival of the Secretary of State for Scotland and after a whispered meeting on the Government Benches the Minister said that it was extremely likely that it would be collected separately, although he did not say whether it would be collected separately and individually from each person living in the house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can we take the Minister at his word? In the course of a 10 minute debate he changed his mind not once or twice, but three times on the central issue. Can we trust him now, when he says that it is extremely likely? The Committee should know exactly the implications before it votes on the amendment. It will be a parliamentary disgrace if the Government force through a vote on the amendment without answering the serious questions that have been raised by Opposition Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not just talking about technical arguments, but important issues. There will be an enormous administrative burden on Scottish Homes if the amendment is not carried. A tremendous amount of time-consuming work will be done by the officials of Scottish Homes if the amendment is not carried and there will be a tremendous waste of effort on the part of Scottish Homes acting as tax collectors instead of an agency that can begin to tackle the housing crisis in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over and above what the Minister has failed to deal with is the fact that this will bring Scottish Homes into direct and bitter party political conflict with the tenants. That is something that the Committee should not even contemplate. The Minister should be prepared either to back down and accept the amendment or at least say that he will take it away and return it to the Committee at a later stage. He should not force us into a Division so that the amendment is lost and the system forced on people of Scotland without proper debate or scrutiny and without answers being given to the representatives of Scottish people in the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galloway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The problem is that the Under-Secretary has been unable to answer questions on amendment No. 90.

He could have given answers to the Committee that is making a law whose writ will run in Scotland. It is an extremely serious matter, if parliamentary democracy means anything.

We shall vote on amendment No. 90, not having been able to have a proper debate. Legitimate questions could not be answered because time could not be afforded so that the Secretary of State for Scotland could tell the Under-Secretary of State what to say. I am sure that he knows the answers to the questions that have been raised. We have been unable, because of the humiliation that it would involve, to take time out so that the Minister could be properly briefed .How can we vote on amendment No. 90 when serious questions remain unanswered because the Minister does not have the basic competence to answer them?

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No.92, in page 2, leave out lines 40 to 42.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The wording at present is
	<br><blockquote><p>"promote, or assist in the promotion of, publicity relating to its general functions and powers and to matters relating to housing".</p></blockquote>
This is interesting, following the debates in which my hon. Friend the Member for East Kilbride (Mr. Ingram) and I were involved in another Standing Committee dealing with the Local Government Bill. The Government there
	<span class='label label-info column'>430</span>
sought to extend the legislation restricting publicity by local authorities. Yet here we have the Government introducing a new draft Bill giving this quango, Scottish Homes, carte blanche to spend what it likes on publicising virtually anything connected with its operations or the general subject of housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that, as the SSHA has had the power to inform people of what it is doing, and to put advertisements in the papers during the winter advising people not to leave taps dripping in order to avoid burst pipes, it is sensible for such a body to be allowed to spend money on publicity and information. The Minister cannot be surprised, however, that we have noticed a slight discrepancy between the Government's approach here and the tight restrictions which they impose on local authorities in Scotland.—	<i>[Interruption.]</i>—I am fascinated to know what on earth the hard Right in the Tory party in Scotland is up to. We have just witnessed the hon. Members for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth) and for Tayside, North disappearing in the company of a senior civil servant from the Scottish Office, which may be bad news for some school or housing estate somewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They may have sent out a search party to find the hon. Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale (Mr. Lang) to answer the question in the last debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He was last seen disappearing into Drumchapel riding on an elephant, I understand, so there might well be a search party to rescue him. Will the Minister say what he had in mind about the publicity which Scottish Homes may enter into? There is some anxiety in my mind that, in the light of some of our debates hitherto, there is a distinct possibility of friction and competition, and major misunderstandings, to put it politely, between local housing authorities and Scottish Homes. On the one hand, local authorities are to be restricted in their power to brief the press, advertise, and publicise their point of view under the Local Government Bill, while on the other hand Scottish Homes, with its substantial public budget, with close relationships with the Secretary of State for Scotland and presumably with his party as well, will apparently be free to put its side of any argument in any way it thinks fit, by briefing the press, advertising, issuing press release, poster campaigns and the rest. I hope that the Minister can assure us that proper restrictions will be imposed on Scottish Homes, so that it will be strictly restricted to publicising information directly connected with the need for information by tenants and owner-occupiers who want to avail themselves of grants, and so forth, or people involved with housing associations. Suppose we were to experience circumstances like, for instance, the South of Scotland Electricity Board. It has been set up for privatisation, with massive glossy adverts appearing in newspapers and magazines, advertising on television, promoting the corporate image, clearly intended to make it attractive for peope who want to invest in the privatised SSEB. If that were to happen with Scottish Homes, it would be an abuse deplored, I hope, by everybody. I invite the Minister to comment on what the electricity board is up to. The Government seem to be applying dual standards on the scope for publicity on the part of public authorities and quangos, and publicity on the part of local authorities. The Minister has some explaining to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Government accepted the amendment, it would effectively limit this important body which the Opposition say that they support. They have qualified that to some extent, but are nevertheless in favour of the principle. Yet telling people that it existed for

	<br><blockquote><p>(b)providing, improving, repairing, maintaining and managing housing"—</p></blockquote>
which is very important—to all the people of Scotland; and that it will also be responsible for
	<br><blockquote><p>"(c) promoting the wider ownership of housing by its occupants"</p></blockquote>
and advising people on
	<br><blockquote><p>"a greater choice of tenancy arrangements",</p></blockquote>
is an essential concern of this housing body. Unless they were able to promote, and assist in the promotion, how would new housing associations make themselves known? How would they get through to the public what was available? The Opposition believe that the people of Scotland, whom they tell us they are always defending, should be advised of all the new opportunities that will be available to them. But how can the bodies do that if they are not able to publicise? It is beyond comprehension.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Fairbairn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Perth and Kinross)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have grown accustomed to that from the Opposition. There is no question but that Opposition Members believe that local authorities, or anyone else of whom they approve should be allowed to used public funds in whatever way they wish. But when it comes to anything that will operate, as they see it, in another way, they oppose it. Opposition Members would be hard pushed to find any evidence that the Scottish Development Agency had used its similar powers in a damaging way. I doubt whether the hon. Gentlemen could find any evidence of that ever having happened. However, the body that is about to be set up is being given the same powers, so that it can advise potential clients of the services and facilities that it can provide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hoped that the hon. Gentleman would have understood that this is a probing amendment. We want to know what the Government have in mind about publicity. We seek similar controls on the publicity exercises of Scottish Homes as apply to the publicity exercises of local authorities. Our anxieties have been aroused by the way in which other quangos, the SSEB in particular, use their powers to publicise their activities. I am not trying to be clever; I am illustrating a genuine point.

Scottish Homes should have powers for promoting and assisting the promotion of its general functions. It would be nonsense for Scottish Homes to become involved in publicity stunts that had nothing to do with the powers in the Bill, particularly those in clause 1, because we are setting up Scottish Homes to do what is in that clause. The wording of the clause is fairly narrow. It leaves Scottish Homes with no option to promote other than that which is in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister and his colleagues have made consistent references to the Scottish Development Agency.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is a very talented and able lawyer. I did not refer to an Act.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My recollection is that hon.

I do not know whether the new power will be available to the SDA, but will the Housing Corporation and the SSHA have a similar power? The Housing Corporation has existed since the 1960s and the SSHA since 1937, and they have managed to operate successfully without that power, so why is it necessary now?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has just assured us that the powers will be exercised reasonably and properly.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If any significant public body uses it powers improperly, remedies are available. If the hon. Gentleman returns to that point later, I shall tell him in more detail about the possible remedies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision that this amendment would remove contains a vital component in our pursuit of diversity, choice and greater individual responsibility. It will be important for Scottish Homes to lay before tenants, landlords, owner-occupiers and developers good quality information on which choice can be based. Many tenants have yet to understand fully the implications and benefits that will accrue from Scottish Homes' work, and it is easy to see from last summer that a little misinformation can cause a good deal of harm and worry to tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The power in paragraph (q) is intended to enable Scottish Homes to give wide coverage to its information using the appropriate methods of publicity. The term covers everything from a notice advising the opening of a housing advice centre to a newspaper campaign explaining how tenants' choice works.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot expect Scottish Homes to be successful in its wide range of tasks unless it can let those who might otherwise be unaware know of the choice available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I trust that the hon. Member will recognise the beneficial side of publicity and agree to withdraw his amendment. Otherwise I must ask the Committee to reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Few of us are unaware of the possible benefits of publicity and promotion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is the suspicion that lurks within many people's minds about the political motivation that lies behind the Government's current propaganda campaigns. Two such campaigns prompted us to table the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people will not be surprised that, in the few months before the general election, the Government spent £9 million publicising the restart programme. Since then, they have spent nothing on television, newspaper or other promotional campaigns for restart. A disgraceful leaflet was distributed on poll tax, and newspaper advertisements told the country a pack of lies about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are two outrageous examples of the way in which the Government sought to
	<br><blockquote><p>"promote, or assist in the promotion of, publicity relating to its general functions".</p></blockquote>
Nobody denies that the poll tax publicity was disgraceful lies. It pretended that people might receive
	<span class='label label-info column'>434</span>
more rebates than they will, and gave the misleading figure of 20 per cent. for a rebate, whereas the Minister later revealed in a written answer that, even if people pay the minimum they must pay up to 41 per cent., and the Scottish average will be 27 per cent. or more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the sort of publicity that frightens us. The Government have not said whether they will give fair and unbiased publicity, such as that associated with Edinburgh district council, or whether they will continue the alarmingly recent trend, which did not exist in the 1970s or even at the beginning of the Government's office. The Government's use of taxpayers' money for purely party political purposes has forced us, as a responsible Opposition, to move the deletion of such powers so that Parliament can scrutinise them if necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I kept my previous contribution brief because I wanted an answer to a genuine question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asked about the SDA and the Housing Corporation and their powers of publicity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I asked whether one of our Chairmen could arrange for the SDA legislation to be made available. The hon. Member for Tayside, North said that the powers sought were similar to those of the SDA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I asked whether the SSHA, which has existed since 1937, and the Housing corporation, which has existed since the 1960s, have similar powers to those which the Goverment propose. I understood that that they do not I asked why it is now thought to be necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The SDA has a similar power under section 2(4) of the Scottish Development Agency Act 1975. The Housing Corporation has a limited power in relation to housing associations and the functions of the SSHA on that connection are not set out in statute. However, shortly before the general election, the SSHA asked me to arrange for a room to be made available upstairs for hon. Members so that the SSHA could lay on an exhibition for Scottish Members of all parties, which I did. The public material that the SSHA produced was excellent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for that answer. I understood that the Housing Corporation had no powers, but I notice in its annual report that it spent £86,000 in 1987 on publicity and that £16,000 of that was spent in Scotland. Is the Minister saying that the SSHA had no power to spend that money, or does it have limited powers to spend money in relation to housing associations? I consider that to be a substantial amount.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right. That is a substantial sum in relation to Scotland's population.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The £86,000 is for the United Kingdom as a whole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had an interesting debate about publicity. Sadly, the Minister had failed to allay our anxiety that we are creating a new quango with an unfettered power to publicise its activities and, more importantly, its opinions, which tend to be those of the Secretary of State for Scotland. My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths) cited recent examples of flagrant abuse of the publicity powers of the Scottish Office on poll tax and the prepartatons for privatisation by the SSEB. There are other examples of abuse by the Government and their agencies to express opinions, which contrasts markedly with the restrictions imposed on local authorities, and that is disturbing. The Minister has confirmed that he intends to maintain those double standards. Nevertheless, I assume that we shall have another opportunity to discuss these matters.

The Minister is known in Scotland as a reasonable man, but his performance in Committee has been far from reasonable. He has rejected every idea put to him. Scottish Homes will have powers to charge for its services. We have discussed the range of services that it will provide, which include advisory, financial, and banking services. It will be almost a public sector building society. It will be interesting to see what charges it is required to make and what financial obligations are attached to Scottish Homes. Do the Government intend it to make a profit? Will it have financial targets like any other nationalised industry? With some services, Scottish Homes has a monopoly. Some professional services might be available only from Scottish Homes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surrounded as I am by lawyers, I imagine that that idea might be attractive. I presume that the Bill could be subject to litigation. As the hon. Member for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Arbuthnot) has a keen interest in Scottish legislation, he may like to consider
	<span class='label label-info column'>436</span>
some local authority legislation that has been imposed by the Government in recent years, giving the Secretary of State powers to do all manner of things to local authorities when he regards them to be acting unreasonably. That term is scattered throughout the legislation applying to local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tabled this probing amendment so that the Minister can explain the type of charges he anticipates that Scottish Homes will impose for any of its services and the financial obigations that the Government propose to impose on Scottish Homes. I hope that such a body applies reasonable charges, rather than profiteering unreasonably. If it is genuinely intended to be a body to co-operate with and assist and support the provision of housing in Scotland, there will be no cause for it to impose unreasonable charges.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eastwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that my hon. Friend the Minister can possibly accept the amendment, but we accept that it is a probing amendment. Can my hon. Friend say why the power is not subject to the approval of the Secretary of State or the Treasury, as it is not included in the list of powers that are subject to that approval? The hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) will understand that it is entirely up to Scottish Homes to decide the charges.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not see anything unreasonably about inserting the word "reasonable". I am sure that the Consumers Association, whose magazine the hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean) is reading at the moment, would not see it as unreasonable. Perhaps the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a very reasonable assumption. That is why I invited the hon. Gentleman to check the pages of the Consumer Association's magazine. He will find that the Consumers Association considers it most unreasonable to let the clause stand. The clause will allow a body to make a charge "as it thinks fit" for any of its services. That is patently unreasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The phrase "such a reasonable charge" will be open to litigation. People can ask the courts to decide whether a charge is reasonable or unreasonable, and within that context, fair or unfair. It is disgraceful that the Government wish to stop SSHA tenants seeking legal redress. Under the clause, Scottish Homes can charge £1 million to a farmer landlord who wants advice though I am sure that Scottish Homes would not charge that. But the problem is that the Government have thrown up serious doubts that any of their actions are reasonable. We wish to ensure that the public and those with an interest in housing are protected. That is why we wish to insert the word "reasonable". I hope that I have given the hon. Member for Penrith and The Border time to check his 	<i>Which?</i> magazine to see whether he can assist us in the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I assume that the hon. Member for Berwick and East Lothian—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Lambie. I hope that the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn) will do me the honour of distinguishing between the hon. Member who is leading for the Labour Party and me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may do me the honour of assuming that it would be impossible to make such a confusion. I assume that the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) regards himself as reasonable. I assume that he thinks that what he has been saying to the Committee in the last many hours is reasonable as he thinks fit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no point in inserting the word "reasonable" if the words "thinks fit" remain. Some one might think it reasonable to charge £1 million to advise someone that he was not supposed to smoke in the offices of Scottish Homes. It is a totally fatuous concept and it has been suggested by an hon. Member who seems to have demonstrated a total absence of reason. It represents the triviality of the alleged moral resentment that has been laid in the amendments. The hon. member for East Lothian apparently feels that
	<br><blockquote><p>"it thinks fit that a charge is reasonable"</p></blockquote>
has a different meaning from
	<br><blockquote><p>"it thinks fit to charge".</p></blockquote>
I charge him to explain the difference. If he had suggested a reasonable charge that somebody else though was reasonable, that might be different. It is judex in sua re as to what is reasonable. We have enough difficulty getting English out of the Opposition, far less Latin. If the hon. Gentleman thinks that the word "reasonable" makes any difference, it is an idiotic idea and it demonstrates the unreasonable assault on the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn) delights in playing verbal games and he intervenes only to do so. The problem could be solved by simple drafting. We are dealing with a serious issue, and that was recognised by the hon. Member for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Arbuthnot) who said that such an amendment could lead to litigation. People could argue that the charges imposed by Scottish Homes were unreasonable. The whole point of the amendment is to give people the opportunity to appeal, and I am sure that hon. Members would not oppose that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill gives many powers to Scottish Homes. The White Paper said that the main purpose of Scottish Homes was to help tenants and landlords to improve housing. We hope that that is the main purpose of
	<span class='label label-info column'>438</span>
Scottish Homes. However, its powers go beyond that. Clause 2(3) gives Scottish Homes the power to
	<br><blockquote><p>"(a) make grants;
(b) make loans;
(c) acquire, hold and dispose of securities;
(d) guarantee obligations (arising out of loans or otherwise)".</p></blockquote>
Those powers are similar to those afforded to a bank or a building society. Perhaps Scottish Homes could become involved with finance capital. It is important to know exactly what is meant by it being able to charge for the services that it provides.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That does not only include the provision of financial services. It is also allowed to "acquire land" and to
	<br><blockquote><p>"hold and manage land and dispose of … land".</p></blockquote>
Scottish Homes could get involved in land speculation. I hope that that will not arise, but it could under the terms of the Bill. Scottish Homes could buy a fine piece of land in the centre of a city in Scotland and dispose of it at a huge profit. It could sell it to someone who wanted to build a supermarket. Scottish Homes could use the profit for another project.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is disgraceful that every Conservative Member, except the hon. Member for Wanstead and Woodford, voted for the Abolition of Domestic Rates Etc. (Scotland) Act 1987, yet none of them can interpret the Act for which they voted. They defended the right of Scottish Homes to collect the poll tax. It might collect it at a profit, take money from the taxpayer and charge above the rate. That is one of the services that it will provide to levying authorities and the regional council. Under the Bill Scottish Homes could make a lot of money out of the taxpayer and make a large profit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scottish Homes will provide advice to tenants, and I wonder whether that will be done at a profit. It is important to establish that Scottish Homes should not be allowed to make an unreasonable profit for the services that it provides. Scottish Homes is not a private sector company. Perhaps the Government intend to establish Scottish Homes, to pump prime it with public money and, when it is up and going, sell it to the private sector. If that is the Government's intention, they should admit it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scottish Homes is a public sector body whose main intention is to provide services that will help tenants and assist in dealing with the housing crisis. However, it will not be able to do so if it seeks to make excessive profits on the services that it provides. That can only be done as it is always done in the public sector—by tackling need and not seeking to make profits. That is how the Opposition perceive the role of Scottish Homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government do not intend that Scottish Homes should be allowed to make excessive profits by charging high rates for the services that it provides to tackle housing problems, they should accept this reasonable amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was delighted to hear the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn) coming to the defence of the Minister. He is the only Conservative Member to have done so following the fairly serious attacks made on the Minister by the Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment shows that if too many lawyers are allowed to become involved, there will be problems. The Minister is an advocate, the hon. Member for Wanstead
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0320">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>439</span>
and Woodford (Mr. Arbuthnot) is a barrister, the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross is a Scottish silk, and I am a plain old solicitor who is throwing in another interpretation of the Bill. We have yet to hear from the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood). I feel suitably humble as lawyers are used to instructing counsel and obtaining their advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot see any objection to the amendment which seeks to make the straightforward and simple point that the charges to be levied for various services that are provided by Scottish Homes should be related to their cost. That is how I interpret the word "reasonable" and, despite the verbal gymnastics displayed by the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross, if the clause were amended there would be no difficulty in interpreting what it intended. The phrase, "make such reasonable charge" stands on its own. The charge must be reasonable and I interpret that as meaning that it would be related to the services being provided. The words, "as it thinks fit" would enable Scottish Homes to determine the charges that it made for any service related to the list of services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the amended clause were adhered to by Scottish Homes in the determination of its charges, there should be no cause for litigation, as "reasonable" is not a word unknown to the law. It appears in many statutes and Acts of Parliament, and its has been considered on numerous occasions by the courts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the word "reasonable" is followed by the words, "as it thinks fit", the amount that the hon. Gentleman thinks it is reasonable to pay for a Rembrandt and the sum that I think it would be reasonable to pay might be totally different. The words,
	<br><blockquote><p>"reasonable as it thinks fit"</p></blockquote>
are no different from the words, "as it thinks fit".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot accept that. The charge must relate to the service which has been provided but the final determinant of what the charge should be rests with Scottish Homes. In that respect, there is nothing wrong in imposing an obligation on Scottish Homes to ensure that its charges are reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) said that the powers that would be granted to Scottish Homes were considerable. They include powers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"make grants … make loans … acquire, hold and dispose of securities".</p></blockquote>
Scottish Homes would be in the same position as banks and building societies and it could challenge them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 2(2)(1) provides that Scottish Homes is entitled to
	<br><blockquote><p>"make land, plant, machinery, equipment and other property available for use by other persons".</p></blockquote>
How would it charge for those items? Any reasonable organisation would relate a charge to the cost to itself of making land, plant or machinery available to determine what it should be and it may determine to allow itself a level of profit. I suggest that the test of reasonableness is appropriate for any public body and I do not accept that
	<span class='label label-info column'>440</span>
there would be a danger of litigation unless the charges were unreasonable. Therefore, I have no difficulty in supporting my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Arbuthnot) said that the amendment was an invitation to litigation and I agree with him. The hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) asked why there was no Treasury involvement. The charges will be for Scottish Homes to determine, taking into account all the facts and circumstances. They will not be subject to consent by the Secretary of State or the Treasury. We expect Scottish Homes to take all the circumstances into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths) asked whether Scottish Homes would act reasonably. There is a general obligation on bodies set up by statute to act reasonably at all times. That is a common law obligation subject to judicial review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to require charges levied by Scottish Homes for its services to be "reasonable". Reasonable men might think that that had some particular meaning, but I doubt that it does in these circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) and for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) were worried that charges would be levied for profit. The powers of Scottish Homes in clause 2 may be exercised only within the general function of clause 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not intend Scottish Homes to provide services to make a profit. It may do so, incidentally, on some services, but those occasions will be far outweighed by occasions when break-even occurs, I also foresee that some services with a real cost will be provided free. Is it "reasonable" to do that? If not, the amendment might cause Scottish Homes to make charges higher than it would wish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An example of a free service is expert advice on setting up a housing co-operative, which can be very time
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0321">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>441</span>
consuming and needs to be thoroughly thought out. Such advice would be valuable but free. I doubt that the hon. Gentleman intended to cast doubt on the provision of free services in such circumstances. On that basis, I am sure that he will not wish to press the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was intended to be a probing amendment. We have had an assurance from the Government that charges will be reasonable. I was especially encouraged when the Minister said that a range of functions would be provided free by Scottish Homes but it would be useful if he could give us some examples. He referred to housing co-operatives; I am sure that the housing co-operative movement in Scotland will welcome the assurance that it will receive free support from Scottish Homes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The kind of advice that will be free is the expert advice to tenants who go to Scottish Homes with their problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is another useful example, and I hope that there will be many more.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is this not a clear departure from the Government's policy of considering anything free to be wholly detrimental? The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth), will remind the Minister that nothing is free. Is the Minister's assurance worth anything?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 p.m.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend must be careful, because we have managed to lure the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) on to some useful ground. He has given specific assurances, for instance, that support advice for housing co-operatives will be given free by Scottish Homes. That is useful and welcome, and I am grateful for that undertaking. I am sure that it will be widely read in the co-operative movement in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to speak for my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, but I hope that he will make it clear that, when the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) says "free", he means at somebody else's expense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman is right. Obviously, nothing in this world is free; everything must be paid for. The question is whether it is paid for out of general taxation or through charges. We have so far been given two useful examples: support and advice for housing co-operatives in Scotland, and advisory services for all categories of tenants in Scotland are to be afforded free of charge by Scottish Homes. We are making useful headway. Those are examples of public subsidies to support important groups of people in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is an important departure from the policy that the Scottish Office has pursued in recent years and I welcome it. Perhaps I could entice the Minister to give a few more
	<span class='label label-info column'>442</span>
examples of free support and advice that might be given to tenants and others involved in housing. What about people who want housing improvement and repair grants? That is complicated now and is likely to get more complicated. We shall come on to that narrow debate later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We debated the care and repair scheme operated under the auspices of the Scottish Office, Shelter and local authorities to co-ordinate support for elderly people in owner-occupied houses which need repair. That service is provided free—the hon and learned Member for Perth and Kinross might prefer to say that it is at the taxpayers' expense—from public and voluntary funds to help owner-occupiers, especially elderly people, who need advice and support to get their homes improved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not the same as sitting in an office waiting for people to apply for housing improvement grants. It involves housing staff going out into the highways and byways to locate substandard houses, encourage people to avail themselves of the grants and help them to find contractors to do the work, and so on. Could that service be provided free from Scottish Homes, or does the Minister intend that a reasonable or unreasonable charge shall be applied in future? That is a matter of interest, and I am slightly disappointed that the Minister does not rise to the bait. Nevertheless, we have made some headway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have some anxiety that less worthy people and bodies will seek the services of Scottish Homes, including certain types of landlord. It is only right that the commercial services of Scottish Homes should be paid for by such customers. Distinctions can be made. The Minister has given a little during this debate, and it will be read carefully by people in the co-operative movement in particular. I gather that charges are intended to be reasonable. On that understanding, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 37, in page 3, line 4, leave out second 'to'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to correct a straightforward drafting error in subsection (2). Hon. Members will see that the amendment is necessary but can be assured that it does not alter the effect of the provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We hoped that it might.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No.22, in page 3, leave out lines 6 and 7.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would remove subsection (2)(t), which allows the agency to
	<br><blockquote><p>"turn its resources to account so far as they are not required for the exercise of any of its general functions and powers."</p></blockquote>
In his reply to the previous debate and my point about the wide powers of Scottish Homes, I understood the Minister to say that all the powers conferred on Scottish Homes under clause 2 are subject to the functions set out in clause 1. I appreciate the significance of that answer. Clause 1(3)(a) to (f) describes the functions of Scottish Homes for housing provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0322">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>443</span>
Clause 1(3)(g) states that Scottish Homes shall have
	<br><blockquote><p>"such other general functions as are conferred upon Scottish Homes by or under this Act or any other enactment."</p></blockquote>
That totally invalidates the Minister's reply. The powers given to Scottish Homes under clause 2 need not relate to housing because clause 1(3)(g) allows it to escape that requirement. It can indulge in making grants and loans at a profit for activities that ha e nothing to do with housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have the same anxiety about subsection (2)(t) of the clause. It gives Scottish Homes a wide power to carry out almost anything outwith its general functions. Scottish Homes may need scope to adapt to new circumstances, but such scope should be limited and precisely defined and controlled, especially as it is not an elected body but is appointed by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to define the powers and functions of Scottish Homes to ensure that it is about housing and helping tenants, landlords, district councils and strategic authorities to provide quality housing, so that the terrible problems afflicting Scottish housing are dealth with effectively. Subsection (2)(t) widens the activities of Scottish Homes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the amendment, which seeks to remove subsection (2)(t). I should be obliged if the hon. Gentleman could advise a simpleton like me what that subsection is supposed to mean.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: According to the Minister's previous reply, the general functions and powers of Scottish Homes confine it to dealing with housing matters. Subsection (2)(t) allows it to turn its available resources to whatever it wishes, even to matters unrelated to housing or any of the powers or functions in the Bill. Scottish Homes will be given a wide scope to do as it likes with any resources that it does not require to meet its statutory functions. That is how I understand the clause, and why the amendment is necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be indefensible for the Government to give Scottish Homes such a wide remit. They must define precisely the circumstances in which Scottish Homes can use its resources for purposes and functions other than those defined in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has yet to respond to our questions about the threat of privatisation that faces all public bodies under the Government. In the long run, Scottish Homes may be a prime target for privatisation. Therefore, it is important that its powers and functions are precisely defined so that it cannot become the sort of free enterprise, buccaneer organisation that, no doubt, the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth) wishes it to become. We hope that Scottish Homes will always be involved in tackling housing problems and the housing crisis in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should consider the amendment as a way of defining more specifically how Scottish Homes can use its resources for functions and powers other than those in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that I need to go over clause 1 (2)(g) in detail, because we have already debated it, and its purpose is set out in the notes on
	<span class='label label-info column'>444</span>
clauses. We need not repeat our discussions on amendment No. 10. Scottish Homes will be a public body, and I wish to outline clearly what paragraph (t) means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to remove from the Bill a sensible and practical provision, which has a direct parallel in the existing powers of the housing corporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Public bodies often have substantial cash in hand on a day-to-day basis. The Government pay grant-in-aid periodically rather than daily and thus a body will find itself, most of the time, with money in its bank accounts which will be needed over the next few days or weeks, but is temporarily surplus. The sensible thing to do with that money is to put it to use through short-term lending. The income generated by that means helps balance out the Government's own borrowing costs in raising the money to provide the grant-in-aid in the first place and, in a wider sense, putting the money to use in that way helps in a modest way to oil the wheels of the economy. The alternative is for money simply to sit idle in Scottish Homes' bank accounts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That process cannot get out of hand. The flow of finance to Scottish Homes from the government is, of course, controlled and, even though Scottish Homes will have other sources of income, clause 10 enables the Secretary of State, if he considers it necessary, to govern the extent to which Scottish Homes may builds up reserves, and to give directions to Scottish Homes on the disposal of any surplus reserves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Bearing in mind the adquate controls provided elsewhere in the bill, the hon. member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion). May wish to withdraw the amendment; failing which I must ask the committee to reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. I understand why any temporarily surplus cash that Scottish Homes will have in hand should be invested for the benefit of Scottish Homes and the functions that it seeks to fulfil.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am anxious about the drafting of the clause. The Bill confers a general power on Scottish Homes to
	<br><blockquote><p>"turn its resources to account".</p></blockquote>
Why is not the clause more specific? It should spell out in detail the answer that the Minister has just given. The Minister says that there are adequate safeguards in the Bill, but what are the safeguards that ensure that the clause is used to allow Scottish Homes to invest its cash reserves only to the advantage of the agency and its beneficiaries?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall come to clause 10 later, but it deals with the miscellaneous financial directions and powers that the Secretary of State has to
	<br><blockquote><p>"give directions to Scottish Homes as to matters relating to—
	<ol>
	<li>… management of reserves</li>
	<li>the carrying of sums to the credit of reserves, or</li>
	<li>the application of reserves …</li>
	<ol>
	<li>(3) The Secretary of State may direct Scottish Homes to pay to him the whole or part of any sums"</li></ol></ol></p></blockquote>
If Scottish Homes has a relatively small sum available, it would be used in the way that I mentioned earlier. If the sum became huge, the Secretary of State would be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0323">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>445</span>
responsible for ensuring that it was used in the best possible way. The provisions of clause 10 give him the power to intervene if necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been an interesting debate. To what extent does the Minister expect that power to be used? Do the Government expect Scottish Homes to derive a significant part of its investment income by playing the market? Those questions are of public interest. The new national housing quango is to be subsidised initially by substantial capital sums, but then is expected to invest some of its money in financial institutions or abroad, under the provisions of the paragraph. The Government must think that that will be the main operation of Scottish Homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What discretion will Scottish Homes have in putting its funds to account? If the Scottish Homes has some money that it does not need to spend for about six months, and wishes to turn it to account, will it be required by Treasury rules or Government edict to invest the money for the greatest possible return or will it be permitted to invest it in an enterprise connected with housing such as construction companies, building materials manufacturers or property developers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am following the hon. Gentleman's argument with interest. Such investments by Scottish Homes will be subject to direction from the Secretary of State with the approval of the Treasury.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is why I am asking the Minister. If the Secretary of State for Scotland is to give direction, this is a golden opportunity to ask the Under-Secretary what sort of direction he expects to give. There are different ways of turning money to account. In some circumstances it would be useful for Scottish Homes to invest its reserve money in other aspects of housing such as housing co-operatives, housing associations or the other ones that I mentioned. Will the Minister advise the Committee on how such powers are to be exercised because he will have discretion in the near future if the operation is established?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I mentioned earlier that it would be sensible to put the funds to use through short-term lending. Scottish Homes will have full discretion to use the temporary funds as it sees appropriate. The Bill does not restrict that, but its power will be subject to financial direction by my right hon. and learned Friend, the Secretary of State. In response to the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion), the wording of the clause is in a standard form. It is a technical provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the Minister's reply that
	<br><blockquote><p>"turn its resources to account"</p></blockquote>
is a standard form of wording, but I am not so sure about other aspects of his reply. As my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) said, we are dealing with the powers of Scottish Homes to invest money and to accrue income from its investments, albeit on a short-term basis. The Minister said that it will have full discretion in the way in which it invests its surplus funds, subject only to the provision that the Secretary of State for Scotland could intervene and direct it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>446</span>
The only criterion that the Minister has given to the Committee whereby the Secretary of State could intervene was if the surplus became "huge". What does he mean by that? He must be more specific. To me, a huge amount of money would be £1,000, although it would not be huge to the Minister or to Scottish Homes. The Minister cannot get away with using inexact terms. He must tell us at what stage and under which criteria the Secretary of State could intervene to direct Scottish Homes to desist from whatever it was doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried about Scottish Homes being given full discretion to invest the money as and where it sees fit. Would it be in order for Scottish Homes to invest money in Chile or South Africa if that would make a good return? We should discuss whether such a body should have the power to invest in Fascist and racist dictatorships throughout the world.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 67, in page 3, line 7, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(u) make grants towards expenses incurred in the promotion of registered housing associations or in the provision of services or advice to such registered housing associations. These grants may be made to registered housing associations and other voluntary organistions.</p></blockquote>
In response to the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson), I seek guidance about how we place some of the amendments. Some of them are more important than others, and some need more time than others. Like other Opposition Members, I am prepared to make my remarks with the maximum economy. I am

	<span class='label label-info column'>447</span>
distressed about the speed with which the Committee seems to be getting through its work. However, the amendment merits a few minutes of the Committee's time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that provision is made for the funding of promotional, advisory and other services to register housing associations. The Minister has made great play of precedents—things are good if there is a precedent for them and bad if there is not. By way of a preface to my remarks, there is a precedent for the amendment. As the Minister knows, the Housing Corporation has the power make grants to registered housing associations and other voluntary organistions under section 87 of the Housing Associations Act 1985.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>indicated assent.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the Minister has the grace to acknowledge that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill makes no specific provisions for promoting and encouraging the development of registered housing associations. If that is so, the amendment should stand. Resources allocated to voluntary organisations—bodies which do not trade for profit—under section 87 of the 1985 Act have been used expeditiously to fund training and the information and consultancy services to both established and developing housing associations. It is the Government's intention—the Minister had made much of it—to build on the success of the housing association movement in its best and most familiar forms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is appropriate that the power to make grants is a permissive power. Whoever will be in charge of making decisions will not be under any obligation, but the discretionary powers will extend in appropriate circumstances to making grants to promote and assist the development and running of registered housing associations. Under the amendment, that discretionary power would be transferred to Scottish Homes. That sensible idea is promoed by the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations. They are right to advert to the need for that addition to the Bill. Who knows how housing associations will develop? They may have all sorts of additional functions or different ways of delivering their services in the future. Therefore, there is a need to give discretion to Scottish Homes to see what is happening and, in appropriate circumstances, to apply appropriate funds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment of the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood). What we are discussing here follows neatly from the undertaking given by the Miniser a few minutes ago that it is his intention that advice and services should be provided free to housing co-operatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would give Scottish Homes the power to make grants for the expenses of establishing and promoting housing associations and other relevant voluntary organisations. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire missed the Minister's earlier comment. We were trying to find out what the Government had in mind for charges and whether they should be qualified as being reasonable. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>448</span>
Minister's answer was that in some circumstances Scottish Homes might choose to provide services free. As an example, he said that it would be required to give free services and advice to housing co-operatives, and we welcomed that. The co-operative movement and everyone else will undoubtedly look at that very closely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here we have a further opportunity to examine broadly the same point but specifically in relation to housing associations. We all have constituency experience of the valuable work of housing associations whether in area renewal in the inner cities and peripheral estates around our larger cities, or in providing housing to meet special needs of the elderly and the handicapped.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
7 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my constituency we are in the process of establishing a housing association to provide housing in the rural areas and to gain access to a source of funding which will help to improve existing property and possibly in due course to build new houses in some of the remote rural communities in East Lothian. Those are areas where housing associations can operate and where the Housing Corporation in Scotland has done some valuable work in co-operation with voluntary groups who have felt sufficiently motivated to get together and go through all the complicated administrative and promotional work to establish a housing association.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The initial soundings, meetings and consultations and the administrative work cost money. Many of the groups who want to provide that type of housing would be deterred if they had to meet all the initial administrative costs out of their own pockets until their association is registered. It is important to make it clear that Scottish Homes will be able to provide that money up front to promote the development of housing associations and similar voluntary organisations associated with housing. It is in that spirit that I strongly support the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, support the amendment. We should not understate the contribution that has been made in the past 10 to 15 years by the housing association movement in Scotland in a variety of areas, not just in general housing needs but in specialised needs where the existing public authorities had some difficulty in meeting their obligations. That was partly because there was no real stated demand for that service and partly because of the lack of flexibility in local government. The current range of provision in Scotland includes specialised provision for the mentally ill, for the mentally handicapped, for the disabled, for former offenders and even for youngsters coming out of care. They are all deserving and demanding groups for which no special provision was made previously. That provision is now made through the housing association movement, backed by the Housing Corporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The change in Scotland in the past 10 to 15 years is very significant. It is perhaps an exaggeration to say that we meet that specialised demand, but we go some way towards meeting it. There will always be developments in housing. New needs will always arise to which local authorities and a large organisation such as Scottish Homes will be less flexible. The current flexibility exists because voluntary organisations decided that there was a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0325">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>449</span>
demand. Groups working with the mentally ill, for example, became involved. The Ark housing association has a specific interest in the mentally handicapped. In my own area, Cornerstone is an organisation which makes specific provision for the mentally ill and handicapped.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those groups got together and formed themselves into housing associations, but it is an expensive process. All manner of hidden expenses which have to be met. First, there are the expenses of incorporation. There is the simple expense of organising meeting rooms, postage and so on before the organisation becomes acceptable for registration by the Housing Corporation. It is only at the stage of registration that a housing association is eligible for funding by the Housing Corporation. It cannot consider or present projects because it cannot afford to do so. It costs money to employ architects and accountants, and voluntary organisations do not have that sort of money. The vast majority of housing associations have arisen from the efforts of voluntary organisations. Our amendment seeks to put an onus on Scottish Homes to
	<br><blockquote><p>"make grants towards expenses incurred",</p></blockquote>
which can be substantial. If we wish to continue to promote good housing and offer a wide choice to meet special needs, we shall depend on housing associations. The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) said that the amendment was proposed by the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations, which is an expert in the matter. It knows the difficulties faced by new associations in getting off the ground. The amendment seeks that Scottish Homes should have the power to promote and encourage a new association or voluntary organisation by meeting some of the initial costs. Those costs will be under the control of Scottish Homes and contributions will be discretionary, so there is no great implication for public expenditure. The power in the Bill is insufficient. There should be a specific provision to allow Scottish Homes to make a small contribution to new housing associations. We must continue to encourage that valuable movement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, support the amendment. The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) said that there was a precedent—the Government are always keen to cite precedents—in that the Housing Corporation has power to make grants to registered housing associations and other voluntary organisations. The Housing Associations Act 1985 is specific about making grants to encourage community housing associations to offer advice and services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to the documentation that poured out in advance of the Bill and which is the only information that the public have had about the proposals. Paragraph 8 of the consultative document referring to tenant involvement states;
	<br><blockquote><p>"New opportunities for housing associations are constantly emerging, such as the development of novel types of tenure, including shared ownership."</p></blockquote>
The final sentence states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Any changes in policy must take account of that wish."</p></blockquote>
The Government want community-based housing associations to emerge. In the White Paper that followed the consultative document, the Government say that housing associations will be able to expand. They wish to
	<span class='label label-info column'>450</span>
see those associations develop. If they are serious about what they say in their consultative document and in the White Paper, they must make it possible for community-based housing associations to develop. Scottish Homes must provide grants to allow that to happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are serious problems in the peripheral estates of Scottish cities. Mistakes were made in the past. I have experience of those in the ward of Trottick and Gillburn where I lived in Dundee. It is a massive housing estate, popularly known as Kirkton, with more than 6,000 houses all of the same type. It was heartbreaking to see the dull uniformity of the estate. No one likes living in large estates where everything looks the same. It is far worse on the west coast of Scotland, in Easterhouse and Drumchapel, where there are 40,000 houses which all look the same. Everybody would be delighted if there were community housing associations so that the people in different parts of Kirkton or Easterhouse had some control over their housing and could develop and change their circumstances, but they will be unable to do that unless the money is put up front. Who will provide that money if Scottish Homes does not?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appeal for unanimity in the Committee to provide resources to allow community-based housing associations to develop in the peripheral estates of Scottish cities. The amendment should not be contentious. I hope that the Minister will get it right, for once, and accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) emphasised my earlier remarks when he referred to nil charges. I gave examples of circumstances in which Scottish Homes might make zero charges. It will have discretion under the Bill to take those decisions. Obviously, those decisions will be for Scottish Homes to take and I cannot envisage all the circumstances that might arise. There may be commercial considerations about which I do not know.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that when we read the record of our proceedings, there will be a slight distinction between what the Minister said now and previously. Which is authoritative?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I said exactly the same thing. The hon. Gentleman went a little further, but the spirit of what I said is absolutely clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) made some valid remarks about peripheral estates. One set of problems was removed with slum clearance but a new set was created. There is no point in recriminations, but we should try to resolve those problems. The hon. Gentleman's comments about the expansion of housing associations were in line with Government policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with much of the thought behind the amendments suggested by the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations, but I do not believe that the powers in the Bill need to be extended in the way proposed. Each of the suggestions made lies within an existing provision. The power in clause 2(2)(a) is sufficient for Scottish Homes to make grants of any sort, provided that the power is exercised for the purposes of its general functions. When a statutory body is given a wide power, as contained in subsection (2)(a), it would be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0326">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>451</span>
restrictive to include an amendment such as paragraph (u) in amendment No. 67. The general power includes the particular.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already said that the Government wish Scottish Homes to have the widest powers. The same argument applies to paragraphs (v) and (w) in amendments Nos. 123 and 124. The functions of Scottish Homes contained in clause 1(3), read with clause 2(1), are sufficient to cater for those matters. I confirm that the power in clause 2(2)(a) is both adequate and ample to enable the current range of grants given by the Housing Corporation under section 87 of the Housing Associations Act 1985, to be continued by Scottish Homes. That is a useful facility which has considerable potential. Next year, the Housing Corporation plans to spend about £150,000. I have not said much about the other two amendments but I shall make some brief remarks as they are on the amendment paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are dealing with amendment No. 67. We shall be calling the other amendments later, so will the Minister confine his remarks to amendment No. 67?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that in these circumstances the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire will see that any concern that may have been expressed by the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations or others is unfounded, and I trust that he will seek to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will believe it when I see it, but I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now come to amendment No. 123—the one that the Minister tried to answer in the previous debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 123, in page 3, line 7, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"(v) take a lead with financial institutions to develop schemes to assist first-time buyers.".</p></blockquote>
7.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, the amendment has been suggested by the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations and is self-explanatory. Its purpose is obviously to ensure that first-time buyers receive sound advice and can take advantage of any schemes that can be specially devised to assist them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The justification of the amendment is that the exercise of real choice over housing tenure—which is what we are seeking that the Bill should provide—depends upon people having a working and sound knowledge of the various choices available to them. That is particularly true of those who are entering the housing market for the first time. Before I entered the House, I was a provincial solicitor and spent many happy hours in the good town of Hawick assisting young people on to the first rung of the property-owning ladder.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>452</span>
The housing Acts applying to the private rented sector may be complicated, but so is advising young couples contemplating marriage, or already married, on the best and most suitable financial package for the purpose of their first home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that Scottish Homes could work with financial institutions to promote awareness of the various ramifications involved in purchasing a house. First-time buyers are particularly vulnerable to some of the pitfalls of home ownership, such as the high interest payments involved in some types of mortgages. I have experience of the problems of front-end loading of interest payments for young people buying for the first time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This matter is close to my heart, and is, I know, close to the heart of my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State, who has frequently spoken about it. One of the most inequitable characteristics of the Scottish law of conveyancing and one which is most harsh on young people who are trying to buy a house for the first time, or those trying to buy a house in the prospect of marriage, results from the method of blind bidding. Purchasers may bid for 100 hours, they may buy one for more than they can afford, or miss one by a penny. But in every attempt to get one, they still have to pay for a separate survey, and it may cost them £300, £500 or £10,000 altogether. That is a gross inequity. My hon. and learned Friend has also expressed that view, but I do not want to upset his present tranquility. As a lawyer I believe that it is a grotesquely unfair burden to put on young people, and I am sure that those Opposition Members who are lawyers agree. We should seek especially to help people to buy their own houses when they are young and in comparatively circumscribed economic circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely support what has just been said. I suspect that it would take us into the realms of reform of the conveyancing law if anything were done to ameliorate that situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is perfectly simple. The sale of heritable property should be by open bidding, not blind bidding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It in no way cuts across the spirit of the amendment. The general line of my comments is that young people need explanations and as much information as possible about the pitfalls of closed bidding systems. The hon. and learned Gentleman is quite right in saying that young people have to spend a great deal of time arranging finance for the make-up bid. That time is often wasted and survey fees can be incurred. I assume that his intervention was a supportive one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of its proposed role to promote
	<br><blockquote><p>"the wider ownership of housing by its occuptants",</p></blockquote>
Scottish Homes should also be involved in the development of schemes to assist people, particularly first-time buyers, to achieve that. The existing home loans scheme, which is seriously undersubscribed, could be developed further, as could schemes involving new forms of mortgage finance. The co-operation of financial institutions with Scottish Homes would be vital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is a sensible addition to the Bill. The Minister earlier resisted a similar amendment by saying
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0327">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>453</span>
that there were general powers in other parts of the Bill which would enable Scottish Homes to do all manner of things. However, I do not think that the generality of powers, either in clauses 1 or 2, would provide specifically for schemes of this order to be undertaken by Scottish Homes. If the Minister is trying to hide behind the fact that he has powers under other parts of the Bill, it would be better to include an explicit provision in the Bill. People will focus their attention on that important aspect of what should be the work of Scottish Homes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the general objective of the hon. Gentleman's amendment. The Government should recognise that there is more to promoting owner-occupation than merely increasing the discount on the sale of council houses. If the Government want to encourage owner-occupation they need to support first-time buyers, particularly younger people, although the same point could be made about all age groups. In their strategy for providing owner-occupation the Government have made a serious mistake in neglecting the category of first-time buyers. We all support the principle of owner-occupation. If people can afford to own their houses, they should be encouraged to do so. That is why there have been tax incentives and other methods of support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An aspect of owner-occupation that I find most disturbing is the serious and alarming increase in the number of mortgage defaults, particularly among first-time buyers. There have been far too many cases in my constituency of people fed up of waiting for houses to rent from the local authority or the Scottish Special Housing Association who, seeing that houses are available to buy, raise loans and mortgages from their banks and building societies which they cannot afford. One can understand their desperation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) talked about young married couples. How many people has he come across who have started a family, but are stuck on waiting lists for council or SSHA houses and are still living in their in-laws' front rooms after two, three or four years? No wonder people living with such anxiety are desperate to get homes of their own and so are prepared to take on almost any commitment, rental, or mortgage repayment to escape from the stress that may be contributing to the break-up of their families or to other difficulties. If they see a house on the market, do their sums and work out that they can just about afford to keep up the mortgage repayments, they walk into the trap.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that schemes of equity sharing help to alleviate that problem? There is considerable scope for such development in Scotland. I believe that clause 2(2)(c) gives Scottish Homes powers to take equity, perhaps on a temporary basis, for new housing developments. That would be a positive step to deal with the problem to which the hon. Gentleman refers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are many of ways of dealing with the problem, but I am worried that many families are getting themselves into what I describe as a trap. That is an appropriate word. I know of people in my constituency who have gone through the sequence of
	<span class='label label-info column'>454</span>
events that I described. They bought a house with a loan and then because of changes in family circumstances being put on short time, losing a job, incurring expenses through illness, and so on—they default on their mortgage repayments and so have their house repossessed by the building society. Those people are not just back where they started—they are worse off because they have to go to the bottom of the housing waiting list. That is an increasingly common factor in the current homelessness crisis in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Packages should be put together to give people the advice that they require. It is important that people understand the commitment that is entailed in a mortgage and that the exact costs will involve not merely mortgage repayments but repairs, insurance and the other elements of home ownership. Much misery is caused because people have been enticed—by glossy advertising, but mainly by desperation—into taking on commitments with which they cannot cope and which put them in serious trouble. After the repossession of their homes, they are right back where they started, living with their in-laws, parents, or friends, in temporary accommodation or caravans and having to suffer all the associated stress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many marriage break-ups arise out of such a combination of financial pressure and housing pressure. I support the spirit of the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, which should be supported by everyone. We must ensure that people who want to buy their own houses receive the right advice and the kind of package that will prevent them from getting into bigger trouble.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The suggestion made by the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) may be a way of overcoming the costs that are likely to arise in the early stages of a mortgage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall recapitulate briefly. Before we adjourned, I intervened in support of the spirit of an amendment moved by the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, which would require Scottish Homes to assist first-time buyers. I sought to illustrate the owner-occupation crisis in Scotland, which causes significant difficulties to many young householders there, and to highlight the fact that there should be ways of avoiding that sort of difficulty. Scottish Homes could have an important role to fulfil in that area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should tell the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) that I agree with the spirit of the amendment. The Government expect Scottish Homes to help first-time buyers in that way.

	<span class='label label-info column'>455</span>
so under clauses 1(3)(c) and 2(2)(d)(e) and (q). I shall go through each of those if the hon. Gentleman wishes, but undertake to re-examine them to ensure that they are adequate for the purposes of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) raised the question of equity sharing. Scottish Homes will continue and will expand the programme of shared ownership housing that was begun by the Housing Corporation.

If, on further investigation, the Minister feels that such an amendment is necessary, I hope that he will table one later.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 104 in page 3, leave out lines 10 to 12 and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"in accordance with a general authority given by the Secretary of State".</p></blockquote>
The amendment highlights the need for the Secretary of State to seek the Treasury's consent. The Secretary of State should have sufficient power and resources to decide priorities without resort to the Treasury. We are alarmed by the provision in lines 10 and 11, which the amendment seeks to remove.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman and his colleagues have argued in favour of Scottish Homes being accountable. The effect of the amendment would be to remove one of the Government's standard methods of ensuring that public money was efficiently
	<span class='label label-info column'>456</span>
managed and appropriately allocated. The need for Treasury consent as well as the approval of the Secretary of State for the exercise of certain powers that may involve significant public expenditure reflects only the fact that Treasury has specific responsibility for public expenditure throughout Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that the financial implications of Scottish Homes projects are carefully and expertly assessed and the implications for public expenditure taken into account. That is the Treasury's function and is appropriately applied to Scottish Homes in the exercise of certain of its powers. Similar controls apply to the Scottish Development Agency specifically, and to most, if not all, similar public bodies.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hate to deprive the Minister of the opportunity of accepting a probing amendment from time to time, but I prefer to get on to the slightly more substantive point of home improvement grants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to the risk of duplication in future between the powers of the local authorities and Scottish Homes regarding improvement and repairs. Will the Minister tell us which body he intends should take the lead? We are genuinely anxious about the fact that the function of paying grants for repairs and improvements to privately owned property may be removed from local authorities and given to the centralised Scottish Homes operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be grateful if the Minister would also tell us more about the Government's thinking on the future of the improvement and repair grant scheme. I understand that about two years ago the Department of the Environment and the Scottish Office issued a Green Paper on the subject, which suggested that improvement and repair grants should be payable only in respect of properties below the tolerable standard. I realise that it may cause the Minister some alarm to refer to properties below the tolerable standard. In a previous debate on the matter, it became abundantly clear that the Government did not have a clue how many properties there were in Scotland below the tolerable standard. They do not know or they do not care. Nevertheless, such a category exists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have suggested that in future, statutory improvement and repair grants should be payable only in respect of such properties. Other grants to upgrade and improve properties, and install basic amenities, would be made only as loans or on an entirely discretionary basis by grant-giving authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the consultation period on the Green Paper is long since complete and as yet, there has been no talk of legislation. Before us we have specific legislation to set up a new housing agency which will apparently have the power to pay such grants in future. The Minister could so us all a favour by telling us about the Government's thinking. There are many questions, and many householders who would like the answers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I deal first with the group of amendments? It strikes at one of the proposals in the Scottish Homes consultation paper, whih received widespread support. I accept that the proposal is novel and appears to encroach on local authority powers. That is not the intention, it is a straightforward proposal intended to simplify the arrangements for obtaining improvement and repairs grants in relatively specialised cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that we all are very ready to praise housing associations working in rehabilitation. Their efforts since 1974 have transformed the classic Scottish slum tenement to the showpiece that it is today. In many cases, owner-occupiers have been able to remain in tenement rehabilitation schemes by participating in the work with the assistance of improvement grants. But this means that owner-occupiers have to apply to their local authority, and the housing association to the Housing Corporation—and later Scottish Homes—for their respective finance. That can lead to difficulties in timing and in co-ordinating schemes. It seemed simpler, therefore, to permit Scottish Homes to make such grants
	<span class='label label-info column'>458</span>
in the circumstances that I have described so that all the public funding came from one source.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have deliberately made the arrangements for grants identical to local authorities' arrangements so that there will be not inequality of treatment between those who apply to local authorities and those who apply to Scottish Homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 26 proposes the omission of this useful facility. It is a useful power and will make rehabilitation of houses easier for all concerned. The amendments do not add anything useful and might, indeed, reduce the simplicity of the arrangements that we propose. I hope that the hon. Member will not press his amendments, failing which I must ask the Committee to reject, them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that this sitting is at an early stage in the Bill, because we are dealing with one of the most important aspects of Scottish Homes. I hope that we shall have time to set out some of our arguments in support of the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not reassured by the Minister's comments. Recent Government handling of repairs grants has been little short of disastrous. They have interfered with local councils and cut their grants. Local councils have legitimately complained on behalf of many thousands of home owners that the Government were oblivious to the problems in the first few years and then tried to solve them all of a sudden by throwing money at them. The chaos that resulted from that policy was recognised not only by local councillors, who may have had a political axe to grind, and recipients of grants who had been waiting in the queue for many years, but by forums such as builders' federations, architects' associations and chartered civil engineers' bodies. I am worried about the clause because it will further centralise powers on repair grants. I fear that the Government will give powers on repair grants to a quango, whereas at present local elected bodies have a say. That would circumvent local criticism or, at least make it ineffective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I firmly believe that local councils, in consultation with the Government, residents' groups and local housing associations would best co-ordinate planning of grant expenditure. Nothing in the Government's record on grants—particularly in the past six years—gives the Committee confidence that they will handle grants effectively in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In recent years local authorities have asked the Government for more balanced resources. Now Scottish Homes will decide how much money local authorities will have and how they should spend it. I admit that the Government have always decided the size of the cake but they have not had the right to interfere with local council's wishes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As one of the councillors who suggested that grant expediture in Edinburgh should be hypothecated—something that has become more common—I should like the Government to accept the merits of that. They should give us the sum that we suggested then, or at least something close to that sum. I have more faith in local authorities than in any Government body—particularly any quango.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0330">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>459</span>
The clause will cause widespread concern. I ask the Government to accept our amendments because they will allow for proper planning of grant expenditure. They will make sure that streets are renovated according to proper plans and avoid the chaos of the past six years in inner city areas where housing is often worse than that found in the worst of the public sector. Work has been frozen in housing action areas in Edinburgh, and that is not a recipe for success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's record is lamentable. They should listen to people who know what is required and accept the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share my hon. Friend's anxiety about the Government's policy on home improvement grants. This method of Funding is a valuable mechanism and it is extremely efficient as a means of improving substandard property, but the Government's record in recent years has not been clever. I remember far too many instances in my constituency when the local authority has run out of money to pay those grants and the only way in which it has been able to persuade owner-occupiers and private proprietors to carry out work that needs to be done is by giving undertakings to pay them in the next year in money becomes available. Therefore, the Government do not have a particularly proud record of funding grants for home improvements and repairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths) that there must be real anxiety as the Government appear to intend that Scottish Homes should become the principal agency for operating this scheme. They intend to take that function from local authorities and centralise it. At least, that is what came through in the Minister's reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred to the Minister's reply, but that is probably not the right terminology to use as, again, he read from a brief. Certainly, he did not reply to the questions that I asked at the beginning of the debate. He is supposed to be the Minister with responsibility for housing in Scotland, and I asked him to explain the Government's policy on home improvement grants. Is it their intention to act on the recommendations and suggestions in the Green Paper? If so, when will they act?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to respond to the hon. Gentleman. On the general subject of improvement and repairs grants, we hope to publish our response to the comments in the Green Paper in the near future. We have, of course, given our initial response in paragraphs 3.12 to 3.18 of the White Paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the "near future" the remainder of the parliamentary process on the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, most certainly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths) claimed that the Government did not have a good record, so I shall give him the facts. Since 1979, 241,000 private sector grant applications in Scotland have been approved. That means that about one quarter of the private sector stock in Scotland has been improved with the help of grants, and that improvement is out of all
	<span class='label label-info column'>460</span>
proportion to that which took place under the last Labour Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not dispute the figures, and I ask the Minister not to dispute my use of the word "chaos". I do not say that the work has not been done, but is there not a shambles? Prior to the 1983 general election, the Government encouraged home owners to take up 90 per cent. grants, but when they applied for them the Government slashed the allocation. It was only before the last general election that the allocation increased to anywhere near the previous levels. The net impact was that local authorities were unable to tell the people who had applied in one year whether they would get grants in the following year or the years after that. People have been waiting for four years, and they will wait for five years. That is the chaos to which I referred. Local authorities could have solved the problem, and we have no faith in the idea that a quango will do a better job.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was specifically for that reason that a special allocation was made to Edinburgh and Glasgow to deal with the backlog to which the hon. Gentleman refers. In fairness, the more than 90 per cent. allocation to which he referred was never proposed as more than a temporary phase, as he would discover if he were to read the statement that was made at the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that Scottish Homes would direct local authorities, but that is not the case. Scottish Homes will not tell local authorities what to do in regard to any matter. The Secretary of State will have the direction-making power. Clause 2(8) provides power to the Secretary of State to give directions to prevent duplication of grant. He will deal with the possibility of grant being paid to one applicant by two authorities—the local authority and Scottish Homes</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a danger of becoming involved in the semantics of who gives directions and who is in charge. Who will have the money? When the Secretary of State distributes money for home improvement grants in Scotland, will it go to Scottish Homes, or direct to local authorities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The money will go to both. The power of the Secretary of State is to give directions to prevent duplication of grant. I expect Scottish Homes to co-operate with local authorities, and I am sure that they will reach reasonable agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present there are two sources of finance for one project. Under the Bill, one project will have one source of finance. That will be more effective, and the measure has the support of the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is worrying me. I have claimed more improvement grants, and I did not know that I could have two bites of the cherry. I understood that all home improvements grants came from the local authority. Otherwise, I could have made a lot more money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In housing action areas, owner-occupiers must apply to their local authority and housing associations must apply to the Housing

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A one-door approach?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps that was not the best expression to use
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is more efficient to have one source of finance for each project.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am worried that the Minister continually says that local authorities will have a strategic role to enable housing to be provided in their areas. But he is arming Scottish Homes with powers to ignore any strategic considerations laid down by district councils. He seems to be ensuring that Scottish Homes will have the facility to make improvement and repair grants independently of what the local authority may wish it to do. Scottish Homes will be totally independent of any influence that local authorities may wish to bring to bear. That is the crux of the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must be realistic. Local authorities cannot do everything, and Scottish Homes cannot do everything. We must find the right balance. That is why we are providing the Secretary of State with powers to give directions to prevent duplication of grant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>462</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that Scottish Homes and local authorities cannot do everything. But a strategy should be agreed, which both should seek to implement. The district council may decide a strategy for housing, but, with the powers in the Bill, Scottish Homes can ignore that strategy and go ahead with its own priorities independently.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have the impression of chaos in the Government's thinking on improvement grants. On the basis that it is always good for an Opposition to stir up Government chaos rather than to try to resolve it, I hope that we shall return to the subject.
