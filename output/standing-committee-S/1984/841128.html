	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Beckett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Derby, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Social Security (Severe Disablement Allowance) Regulations 1984.</p></blockquote>
We have asked for this debate because we wish to air a number of serious issues and to receive satisfaction from the Minister on a number of questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are somewhat disturbed by some of the factors underlying the regulations. In addition, we wish to ask a number of questions about the details of the regulations as they stand. I shall place on record some of our reservations on matters of principle. The Minister will be to some extent familiar with them but, as the regulations have not been corrected or altered, it is important to restate them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are unhappy with the basic idea behind the allowance as it is being put into effect. The regulations replace a non-contributory invalidity pension by a disablement allowance, based on a different test from household duties which brought the NCIP into some disrepute towards the end of its life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those who become so severely disabled as to be incapacitated for work before the age of 20, or those who become incapacitated for work but who have had the opportunity to build up contribution conditions, may be entitled to an invalidity pension. What is particularly unfortunate is that those who become so incapacitated after the age 20 and, through no fault of theirs—particularly at a time of high unemployment — have had no opportunity to build up contribution conditions, will now have to satisfy two tests: not only a test of incapacity for work but a severe test of extent of disability. The latter is usually referred to as 80 per cent. disability, although the Minister has assured us in the past that 75 per cent. disability will suffice to qualify for the allowance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, 75 per cent. is a very high level of disability, and we were not convinced by the Minister's arguments in Committee or on Report that it would be simple to assess. In cases of mental disorder or mental illness, the mind boggles—if I may use a somewhat dubious term—at the thought of trying to assess whether someone is 55 per cent., 54 per cent., 75 per cent. or 78 per cent. mentally incapacitated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister told us that there had been evidence from war injuries of a mental component of disability amounting to almost 100 per cent. or a combination of mental and physical components. Nevertheless, the Opposition remain unconvinced that it will be easy to
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
make such an assessment for the many people who have been entitled to non-contributory invalidity pensions in the past. I recollect that more than 80,000 people receive noncontributory invalidity pensions because of mental illness or incapacity. We are frankly horrified at the idea of trying to assess the precise percentage of disability in that number of people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other main area of principle that we wish to air again is what was called on Report "the black hole". There are two versions of that. The first is when people teeter on the edge of the hole for years because, although they would satisfy the conditions for severe disablement allowance they are not in the age group which can apply for them. For a year, therefore, they may be entitled to receive the allowances on the grounds of their disability but do not receive them merely because of their age.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Far worse than that, because the Government saw the inconvenience of running the two systems side by side, some people will not be entitled to apply either for noncontributory invalidity pension or severe disablement allowance because non-contributory invalidity pension ceased on the very day that severe disablement allowance came into existence. Although those people may have met the conditions for non-contributory invalidity pensions, they will not be able to meet the percentage disability condition for severe disablement allowance. The people who might have qualified for benefits which would have given them a passport to severe disablement allowance will lose that opportunity for the sake of administrative convenience. We told the Minister in Committee that that was invidious and our opinion remains the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are the main areas of principle on which the Opposition are still unhappy. Let me now deal with the details of the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are aware that the residence conditions are similar to those which existed for non-contributory invalidity pensions. Nevertheless, we believe that the Government have made a mistake in perpetuating them and we wish to draw attention again to the unfairness of the conditions in the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is reference to a 10-year residence condition for entitlement. The Government have argued on one or two different grounds when the matter has arisen in the past. The basic argument was that it was necessary to prove a long-standing connection with this country in order to establish an entitlement to such benefits. The argument now seems to be that severe disablement allowances will eventually convert to retirement pensions, so a residence test of this duration is appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The invalid care allowance is a non-contributory income maintenance benefit. That allowance provides an income, as of right, to a person caring for a severely disabled person who may be receiving an attendance allowance. The residence condition for that allowance is that the disabled person must be ordinarily resident in Britain and have been present for 26 weeks during the previous 12 months. That is a sensible and fair residence condition and we would have been happy to see it in the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned, however, that, because of the way in which the residence conditions are drawn, someone who should be receiving the allowance might not be entitled to it because of those conditions. For example, a severely disabled person who became eligible for an attendance allowance, and whose career became eligible for invalid care allowance, would have to wait another 26 weeks
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V008P0I0415">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
before receiving the mobility allowance but he might have to wait four, six or nine years before becoming eligible for severe disablement allowance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When it is clear that one allowance can be paid, it is invidious and unnecessary that a person might have to wait 10 years to get the severe disablement allowance. We should like the Minister's assurance this morning that the Government will continue to review that matter and we hope that they may be prepared to reconsider it in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall go through the provisions that I want to draw attention to rather than question. Regulation 7(3) attempts to give severely disabled young people a chance to establish whether they are incapable of work. We welcome the fact that the Government have put that provision into the regulations as they did not appear to be prepared to do so in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I am sure that the Minister realises that the provision is entirely unintelligible to a normal human being. I hope that clear guidance will be given not merely to those who might be entitled to the allowance but to those who are supposed to advise them on whether they are entitled to it. Sadly, we are aware that sometimes those officers do not understand the Government's provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take it that the intention of regulation 9(	<i>d</i>)(iii) is to allow those who are, for example, mentally ill to have therapeutic earnings. We welcome that provision, because the charities dealing with the mentally ill drew special attention to the matter when they considered the Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 10 deals with passporting — a person's eltitlement to the severe disablement allowance because he receives an attendance or mobility allowance, and so on. We should like to press the Minister to consider extending the provisions. I understand that an adjudicating medical practitioner can sometimes decide whether someone is at least 80 per cent. or 75 per cent. disabled by, for example, the production of an audiogram where the disability is deafness. In Scotland, they have had the vision to make available a single report which can be used to show that a disability satisfies the 80 per cent. test. We should like to see entitlement to the allowance extended through some single and simple procedure, such as qualifying for an attendance allowance, where evidence of the extent of disability is available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, there is the position of someone in the process of qualifying for an attendance allowance. As the Minister will be aware, the qualifying conditions for attendance allowance must be satisfied for a full six months. As the regulations stand, once an allowance has been awarded, entitlement to severe disablement allowance goes with it. Is it not possible during that six months for the person to get severe disablement allowance without having to satisfy the 80 per cent. test separately from satisfying the attendance allowance qualifications?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also felt that in each of the examples to which I have drawn attention, referring claims to an adjudicating medical practitioner is unnecessary and likely to create more delay and extra work. As the Committee will be aware, such delay often causes resentment and anxiety. I hope that the Minister will look at that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister clarify the latter part of regulation 5, which appears to suggest that someone who is over retirement age does not need to satisfy subsections (2) or (3)—in other words, the period of entitlement to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
allowance? However, it refers to whether the person satisfies the other requirements for entitlement. I have examined the Bill carefully and the only other requirement that I can identify is that of the degree of disability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister reasssure us that the regulation does not mean that if the disability of someone over retiring age, who has qualified, probably for some years, for a severe disablement allowance, falls below 75 per cent., that allowance will be taken from him? That is how I understand the regulation, but I hope that the Minister will assure me that I am mistaken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.46 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Rogers 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rhondda)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to ask a couple of brief questions, principally because I do not understand the language of the regulations. I shall need to try to sort out the problems of my constituents in my surgery and advise them so matters will be even more difficult if I do not understand them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 8 on page 4 is headed:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Circumstances in which a person is to be treated as receiving full-time education".</p></blockquote>
I cannot understand why it appears to preclude an allowance for mature students with severe disablement. Often, people with physical disabilities seek education much later in life, but regulation 8(3) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A person over the age of 19 shall be treated as not receiving full-time education."</p></blockquote>
I do not understand why it needs to be included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, there is a general beef about regulation 10(1)(	<i>b</i>) and the evidence relating to the passporting effect — a mobility allowance leading to qualification for disablement allowance. Again, that does not take into account the practical experience of the terrain or the surrounding conditions in which people live when mobility allowances are granted. I continually receive letters from the Department saying that where people live does not alter the degree of disability that determines the granting of mobility allowances. That is absolute nonsense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, someone who lives in the verdant fields of Mitcham and Morden may cope quite well with the flat ground in those areas. However, in my area one must go either up or down, so the problem of disablement must be seen in a different context. Therefore, I do not understand why people should be denied mobility allowance by stupid adjudications of that sort. I earnestly ask the Minister to consider that aspect because it is an important area of passporting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.48 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh Brown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Provan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A member of a Committee on statutory instruments is tempted to stay quiet, so I was surprised to see so many Conservative Members present today. I do not know whether the Government expect a revolt over the regulations, but if they do, or if they fear that some Conservative Members will vote with the Opposition, they will be disappointed. I suspect that only one or two members of the Committee understand them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Increasingly, I lose confidence, even with all my experience in the House, when I hear my Front Bench spokesmen and, certainly, when I listen to the Minister, who is a master of detail. I thought that I knew something about social security but there is now virtually a battle between the research assistants and academics who advise the Minister and those who advise my Front Bench spokesmen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V008P0I0416">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
My only reason for speaking is to appeal to the Minister to tell us the rationale behind this change. Will he tell us who it will benefit rather than give us details of what is involved? What steps are taken to train staff in such a matter? How does the Department set about advising the Claimants Union and welfare rights people?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the biggest local offices in the country is in my constituency. I am an ex-employee of the Department and I used to think that I knew something about the subject. The office in my constituency has a first-class manager and good staff, albeit under pressure from the Department and seriously understaffed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not go into the political arguments, but a genuine attempt is being made in one of the most deprived areas in the country to ensure that local groups—not merely pressure groups — that try to advise constituents get more support and encouragement than they have had so far. Thank goodness the groups are there; I could not advise my constituents in such detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At such a meeting, I heard the responsible officer from the Department explain the provisions of this new benefit. I confess —this is far from a criticism; I suspect the Minister will face the same difficulty when he tries to explain the matter—that I found it a most technical subject. I hope that the Minister can assure me that giving information is one of the Department's priorities and that it may unearth many who should have been claiming NCIP in the first place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister reassure me on the adequacy of the knowledge and information that the Department possesses and is passing out, and say whether there is a serious attempt to unearth those who should be claiming but have not claimed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.50 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Social Security (Mr. Tony Newton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will start with some general issues before I go on to the detailed points raised by the hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) and others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady referred to the general case that we debated at some length earlier in the year, which brought into existence the new benefit replacing the existing noncontributory invalidity benefits. It would be unfair to the Committee if I attempted to rehearse all the arguments, but I shall try to deal with the hon. Lady's general points and at the same time to pick up some of those made by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Lady acknowledged— rather less than fully—the household duties test, which was previously the sex-discriminatory qualification whereby married women could obtain a non-contributory invalidity pension, undoubtedly caused controversy and distress to some claimants. That has been so virtually ever since it was introduced in 1977–78—not just, as the hon. Lady said at the end of the life of the test.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Quite apart from the problems of a special test for married women, and the nature of the test—involving what many married women saw as a humiliating process of showing whether they could do certain physical activities in the house. That was manifestly a serious discrimination against married women, who had to pass a test that no one else had to pass. The benefit was available on one set of terms to men and single women and on a quite different and much more restricted set of terms to married women.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
We thought that unsatisfactory and I believe that we were widely supported. The obvious answer, which understandably many people, including pressure groups, pressed on this Government as they did on the previous Labour Government, was simply to get rid of the household duties test and have the same rules for everyone on the old non-contributory invalidity pension rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That solution was resisted by the Labour Government on grounds of cost. They went to great trouble to rush regulations through the House in 1978 in about 30 minutes flat, when it looked as though that solution might be adopted as a result of decisions by the adjudication authorities. It has been resisted by the present Government also on grounds of cost. It would cost about £300 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We therefore set out to devise a structure for a benefit that would be non-discriminatory and would be an improvement by bringing in additional beneficiaries without, on grounds of cost, going as far as some would have liked. I never ran away from that argument in Committee or attempted to disguise it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We came up with this proposal, involving the application of a secondary test — the 80 per cent. disability test—to all claimants over the age of 20, to replace the household duties test which applied only to married women. We estimated that, after two years when it had been fully phased in, it would bring into benefit about 20,000 more people than the existing system. The net addition will fall eventually because of the passporting of those in receipt of the existing benefit. However, in the earlier stages we shall get rid of the household duties test, extend the benefits to 20,000 more people and add only another £20 million to the social security benefit bill. We believed that to be a reasonable way forward in this very difficult field.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rogers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did the Minister say that the Government resisted the abolition of the household duties test because it would cost £300 million?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Newton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rogers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the Minister said later that it would bring in an extra 20,000 claimants, at a cost of £20 million. I cannot follow the Minister's argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Newton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise if I did not make myself clear. The basic test for receipt of this benefit is being incapable of work. If the applicant is not incapable of work, the argument does not apply. If the applicant is under 20, to receive the SDA, he must be incapable of work. For people over 20 we have introduced a secondary test of 80 per cent. disability. That will apply to people generally and in effect will replace the old household duties test which applied only to married women. I believe that explanation is as clear as I can make it in this complicated field.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The application of the secondary test to those over 20 performs the same function as the household duties test formed in relation to married women. It limits the application of benefit to people who would otherwise qualify simply by being incapable of work. The household duties test excluded many married women and it would have cost almost £300 million to include them all. The 80 per cent. disability test also excludes a number of people, but 20,000 fewer people than would have been excluded under the old system. However, they will not necessarily
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V008P0I0417">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
be the same peple. The additional people will be mainly married women who would previously have been disqualified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know if that is clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rogers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As mud.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Newton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me try once more. If we simply paid non-contributory invalidity pension, under whatever title, to all those who were incapable of work but did not have a contribution record, the bill would have risen by almost £300 million. We have changed the rules in a way that does not incur that full cost or bring in all the people who were previously excluded. However, we estimate that 20,000 additional people will be included who would previously have been excluded. As the benefit is about £20 a week—it will be a little more now, following the uprating — not much mathematics is involved in calculating that the net additional cost will be about £20 million a year.

I am prepared to reply to further quesions about this matter, but I am conscious that my hon. Friends may wish me to move on. In a difficult area I believe that I have done as well as I can for the moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rogers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I notice that the only member of the Committee who is nodding away is our Liberal colleague the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood). I wonder whether he could elucidate because I do not understand the Minister's reference to £300 million. He related it specifically to household duties. If he is saying that the 80 per cent. provision is the equivalent of the old household duties test, the allowance is a very restrictive covenant. Instead of looking to it to overcome the anomalies of the old NCIP, the Minister is substituting something with a different name which is extremely restrictive. The restrictions relate to the specific problems which occurred when the NCIP was abolished.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. K. Harvey Proctor 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Billericay)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hazard a guess that the majority of the Committee are perfectly clear that there has been a modest improvement in this matter and that most members of the Committee are grateful to the Minister for introducing the provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Newton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am duly grateful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Newton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are now in danger of collapsing into a succession of interventions and no speech. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Billericay (Mr. Proctor), whose well-known interest in the problems of the mentally handicapped and mentally ill is shown by questions in the House and his recognition of the merits of this new benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the nicest possible way, I say to the hon. Member for Rhondda that that is not what the regulations are doing. They are based on primary legislation debated exhaustively in Committee and in the House earlier in the year in which the general principles of the benefit were —I think that the hon. Member for Derby, South will agree—intensively examined. I would not dispute some of the points made by the hon. Member for Rhondda. As I openly acknowledged in Committee, I did not feel, any more than the previous Labour Government felt, that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
resources were available to extend non-contributory invalidity pension without any restriction. We have changed the nature of the restrictions in a way which removes discrimination against married women and which, in our estimate, means that more people overall will receive benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have allowed the Minister, on no less than three occasions—there may have been more but for the intervention of his hon. Friend the Member for Billericay (Mr. Proctor) — to get away with claiming that more people will be entitled to the allowance. However, we must now put it on record that many disabled organisations seriously contest the Government's claim that many more, if any more, people will be entitled to the allowance under this legislation. The Minister is well aware of that. As my hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda (Mr. Rogers) said, correctly, the Government want credit for removing one restriction, which was invidious, while introducing a different one of the same extent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Newton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise, and I openly acknowledged in Committee, that there is necessarily some uncertainty about estimates here. Obviously we shall be prepared to look at the way things go in the light of experience and draw appropriate conclusions according to the evidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown) asked what we had done to spread public understanding of our proposals and especially to secure claims for the existing benefit so that people can automatically be passported on to the new benefits. We consider that to be of great importance. We launched a £400,000 publicity campaign on 10 September and as a result have so far had over 38,000 requests for leaflets and claim forms at the central leaflets unit. We believe that the number of claims —I do not have absolutely up-to-date information—will have risen to about 6,500 as at 20 November, although it is too early to judge how many are likely to be successful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result both of our advertising campaign and of a much more specific effort that we made to write to all recipients of supplementary benefit who we thought might have an underlying title to non-contributory invalidity pension—those receiving supplementary benefit as being incapable of work but not receiving the contributory invalidity benefits—we issued about 57,000 invitations to claim the old benefits by the end of October. Those invitations produced a 60 per cent. response rate. In other words, we have had considerable success with our major effort to identify those who had an underlying title to noncontributory invalidity pension but were not claiming it, so that we could get them to claim it and then passport them on to severe disablement allowance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New claims for both non-contributory invalidity pension and housewives' non-contributory invalidity pension are currently running at about four times the number received in the corresponding period last year. For example, in the past three months, we have received about 17,000 extra claims. As I said, where an award is made, the person will be automatically passported on to severe disablement allowance. Where a claim under the HNCIP is not successful, we shall go on to test entitlement under the new SDA rules to identify as many as possible of those who we believe will be gainers—despite what the hon. Lady has said about the statistics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be a mistake for me to spend much more time on the complexities of the scheme. Of course, we are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V008P0I0418">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
undertaking appropriate staff training. We must all acknowledge that, under this Government or any other, social security regulations and the law that underlies them are often far more complicated than most claimants are likely to be able to understand. There is nothing new about that. As I once said in the House, if retirement pensioners had to understand the national insurance regulations in order to claim a retirement pension, we should certainly not have between 9 million and 10 million retirement pensioners. We should be lucky to have three.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we have a duty to explain matters as clearly as possible. We spent a good deal of time on the SDA leaflet, although I hope that it will be possible to improve it further. Following contacts that my predecessor had with the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, we have just produced, for the first time, a rather good handbook on all the non-contributory disablement benefits. That has gone down rather well and represents a further part of our effort to ensure that claimants and groups have the best information and advice that we can make available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Alongside that, we have introduced a Freefone service nationally, except, for the moment, in the London area. That has proved very successful and is making it much easier for people to obtain advice from the DHSS from properly qualified staff, trained in a good telephone manner, without having to go to local DHSS offices. I sometimes get a bit fed up with being accused of not making efforts to improve people's understanding. We are doing a great deal and with some success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations simply fill in the detailed rules that are needed to implement the basic decisions taken in the Health and Social Security Act 1984. They also reflect undertakings that I was able to give on various points during our debates on that Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part II of the regulations includes the main provisions of the scheme. Regulations 3 to 9, broadly speaking, follow the rules that currently apply to non-contributory invalidity pension but, when the SDA regulations were drawn up, we took the opportunity to improve on or clarify the present provisions where we could. In regulation 3, for example, the new provisions covering the present tests for SDA will help to simplify administration and will enable some people to qualify for benefit two weeks earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Briefly, the non-contributory invalidity pension regulations currently provide that a person must have been present in Great Britain for 26 weeks, or 182 days, in the 52 weeks preceding the day for which benefit is claimed. But the same regulations also provide that, as part of the incapacity test, a claimant must have been present in Great Britain for 168 days out of the 196-day qualifying period. It will be realised that there is an apparent conflict in the rules over the number of days involved; indeed, they led to a great deal of confusion both for claimants and for the Department's staff. Therefore, the SDA regulations drop the 26-week or 182-day presence test and retain the easier 168-day condition. We have also retained the special concession for forces families, mariners and airmen which we introduced last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady referred to the residence and presence tests generally. There is a clear need to impose some limits to entitlement to non-contributory benefits according to an individual's connection with this country. For each such benefit, therefore, there is a combination of rules generally requiring residence, ordinary residence or present in Great Britain. The SDA regulations provide that a claimant must
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
be present in Great Britain when he claims, that he must have been present here for 24 out of the previous 28 weeks and that he must have been resident in Great Britain for periods amounting to at least 10 years in the previous 20 years or, if he is under 20, for at least 10 years since birth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Lady fairly acknowledged, these are broadly the same rules which the Labour Government thought appropriate for non-contributory invalidity pension, even though we have removed one anomaly, to which I referred, in the SDA regulations. In regard to the residence test, the hon. Lady made the point that easier rules apply to attendance allowance and mobility allowance. In effect, that is the same explanation as for the invalid care allowance that she mentioned, which is tied, in a sense, to the receipt of attendance allowance. Therefore, it makes sense to have the same rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are allowances paid in respect of specific handicaps. They are not income maintenance benefits, nor do they have a direct counterpart in the contributory system. Therefore, a more generous residence rule was thought to be justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 10-year residence test, which demonstrates a more substantial link with this country, is and has been applied in the case of non-contributory retirement pension and other maintenance benefit. As non-contributory invalidity pension, and SDA, is a maintenance benefit that can be paid, unlike the contributory benefits, beyond normal retiring age for those who have not built up a contribution record to qualify for a retirement pension, some connection between those two non-contributory benefits —the non-contributory pension and the non-contributory invalidity benefit — seemed to be right. We have proposed that that should continue for severe disablement allowance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, as the hon. Lady spoke fairly and asked me to continue to think about the matter it will not surprise her to know that as part of the general process of social security review we will be looking at different rules of that kind which apply in various different bits of the benefits system. Frankly, the rationale is often not as strong now as when they were introduced. I make no promises about change but I recognise the point that she and some outside bodies have made. There is a fair tangle of residence rules, and indeed a number of other rules, which vary according to different benefits within the system. In the process of trying to simplify the social security system, among other matters, we will examine that aspect, and, of course, we will bear in mind what the hon. Lady and others have said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to regulations 4 and 5, although severe disablement allowance, like non-contributory invalidity pension, is primarily intended as an income replacement benefit for people of working age, we have carried forward the provisions which will enable those already drawing benefit when they reach pension age to continue to receive it if they fail to qualify for a retirement pension at a higher rate. Indeed, beyond the deemed retiring age of 70 for a man or 65 for a moman, severe disablement allowance, in effect, becomes a non-contributory retirement pension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason—this is in direct answer to one of the points raised by the hon. Lady—is that under regulation 5 a person will no longer need to show that he is incapable of work or to satisfy the additional disablement test in order to draw the benefit. At that point it effectively becomes a passport from a non-contributory invalidity
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V008P0I0419">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
benefit to a non-contributory retirement pension. I hope the hon. Lady will consider that sensible, fair and helpful from everyone's point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 6 extends the normal linking rules to severe disablement allownace and regulation 7 provides the same definition of incapacity for work as currently applies to non-contributory invalidity pension. and contributory sickness and invalidity benefit. Regulation 7 also contains an important concession which I announced on Report. It enables periods of up to six months in aggregate to be ignored in deciding whether a person has been continuously incapable of work since before the age of 20 and, consequently whether he is able to qualify for severe disablement allowance on the single test of incapacity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That rule will apply to all claims for severe disablement allownace, including the first, and will provide a somewhat longer period than the normal linking rules allow for a person who qualified for SDA when under the age of 20—or who could have qualified had he claimed —to attempt to work when over that age still retain title to SDA on the easier rules should that attempt fail. I am grateful to the hon. Lady for acknowledging that that is an improvement and that it was discussed in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This provision has been welcomed by the voluntary organisations representing disabled people. Together with the therapeutic earnings rule—to which the hon. Lady also referred—which is extended to SDA by regulation 9, the provision will, I hope, go a long way towards easing some of the fears that have been expressed about the possible disincentive effects of the cut-off age of 20.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Rhondda asked about full-time education and the application to people over 19. That is intended to be a helpful provision and to avoid the risk that being in full-time education could be taken as evidence of being capable for work and thus undermine the basic entitlement to the benefit. I assure the hon. Gentleman that the intention behind the point to which he drew attention, far from being unhelpful to mature students, was to ensure that such students would not be knocked out by being deemed capable of work simply because they were in full-time education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 8 covers full-time education for SDA purposes and has also been welcomed by the voluntary organisations as a considerable improvement on the present NCIP provisions. As I said in Committee, we expect that the effect will be broadly similar to the present NCIP rules, but we have now included a formal definition of what is to count as full-time education for those aged 16 to 18. We have also dropped any reference to the type of school attended; the policy under the Education Act 1981 is to encourage disabled youngsters to attend normal schools whenever possible. I am sure that the whole Committee supports that principle. Under regulation 10, that matter will now be determined by the independent adjudicating authorities in all cases instead of, as in some cases previously, by the Secretary of State alone, against whose decision there might be no appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference has also been made to the passporting arrangements covered in regulation 10. Under those provisions, some groups will automatically be accepted as at least 80 per cent. disabled without the need for further examination. I am sure that that will simplify matters considerably for a large number of claimants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
The hon. Members for Rhondda and for Derby, South raised points about extending the passport provisions. It might be best if I undertake to look at the points raised by the hon. Member for Derby, South, about existing tests, especially in relation to deaf people and to blind people in Scotland. I wish to say more about Scotland shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure that I understood the question of the hon. Member for Rhondda about the mobility allowance. We are saying that if a person qualifies for a mobility allowance, that will be automatically taken as fulfilling the 80 per cent. test for severe disablement allowance. That seems sensible and clear-cut. I am not sure quite what the hon. Gentleman was pressing me about as an extension of that proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rogers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point is that the original assessment for mobility allowance does not take into account a person's circumstances. I have heard continually from the mobility allowance unit that account cannot be taken of the geomorphology of the area in which a person lives. There is thus a knock-back effect which takes out people who live in areas such as the Rhondda.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Newton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In effect, the hon. Gentleman has directed me, in an ingenious way, to arguing about the criteria for mobility allowance rather than the criteria for severe disablement allowance. I am sure that you, Mr. Leadbitter, would not wish me to widen the debate to that extent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rogers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, he would.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Newton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I am allowed to help you, Mr. Leadbitter, I think that we should be straying close to the edges of order if I started debating the qualifying conditions for mobility allowance—except, perhaps, to say that, as Minister for the disabled, I am well aware of the hon. Gentleman's point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever may be said about mobility allowance, it would be extremely difficult to argue that a noncontributory income maintenance benefit should be affected by whether the recipient lives in a rural, urban or any other area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even were it possible to accept that mobility allowance should take account of whether or not someone lives on a bus route, it would then become impossible to use it for passporting to SDA, because no one could argue that receipt of a non-contributory income maintenance benefit should depend on that factor. I think that the hon. Gentleman is pushing his luck.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rogers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am amazed at the mentality that argues that receipt of a non-contributory income maintenance benefit depends on whether one lives near buses. The Minister should come to south Wales, where, as a result of poor transport facilities, we have no buses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am simply talking about the case of, say, a pneumoconiotic miner, who could easily cope with the problems of walking around most of south-east England but finds great problems in carrying out basic human tasks such as going to the post office or doing a little shopping, if he is widower, on an incline of one in five, which is found in most of the Rhondda valley.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am talking not about the infrastructure but about the geography, which is directly related to mobility. It is far more difficult for someone to walk up a hill than on the flat.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V008P0I0420">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Newton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's point. It is a variant of that which I had in mind — that mobility allowance should, in effect, depend on people's geographical circumstances and, in some cases, on the facilities available to them, in buses or in other ways, and on the nature of the terrain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without pursuing that argument further, all I shall say is that, even if mobility allowance were changed to take those factors into account, it would then become impossible to use that as a passport to an income maintenance benefit. That benefit could not be justified if it depended on whether a man lived in a hilly area or a flat one, given that the basic problem was whether he was capable of work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the information both of the Committee and of those interested outside the House, I should say that the passporting arrangements for the registered blind and partially sighted will in practice, and for purely practical reasons, apply in England and Wales only. In Scotland, any local authority registers of the blind and partially sighted are purely voluntary and non-statutory. Therefore, those claiming SDA will fall to have their level of disablement assessed by the adjudicating medical authorities. In most cases, however, we expect that the available evidence — which I hope would include evidence such as the hon. Member for Derby, South mentioned — will remove the need for a medical examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will appreciate that the wider question of the criteria to be applied by the adjudicating medical authorities in assessing the degree of disablement for SDA is not a matter for these regulations. However, I confirm that, as we said in Committee, we intend to publish the guidance that is to be made available to our doctors. That will be along the lines of the handbook which is already available for industrial injuries cases. The SDA handbook has been prepared in draft form and it was issued for comment to the various voluntary organisations at the end of September. We are currently considering the helpful and constructive comments that we have received and as soon as we can publish the finished version, copies of it will be placed in the Library.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that in the course of outlining the main provisions, I have managed to deal with the points raised by hon. Members. Although I cannot pretend that this is a perfect benefit and am well aware of the views of those who would like it widened still further, I hope that the Committee is satisfied that what we propose contributes to a useful but modest improvement in the social security system and that it will give its assent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.25 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Two main issues have emerged from the debate. First, we are again highlighting the fact that while the Government are introducing a different kind of
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
restriction, the extent of its application is basically similar to that which existed before. That is something of a disappointment, because although the Minister pointed out that it was not possible some years ago for a predecessor Government to introduce the benefit without those restrictions, it was introduced at a restricted level with the intension that the restrictions would be removed as soon as possible. I believe that the Minister will acknowledge that when the Government continued to state that they were examining the household duties test for noncontributory invalidity pension, would be producing a report and were hoping to introduce changes, it was not generally understood that those changes would bring little if any improvement in the number of people who would be entitled to such a benefit. However, that is a matter of long-standing debate in Committee and on the Floor of the House. I leave it at that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda (Mr. Rogers) raised an important point about mobility allowance of the kind that has caused people so much anxiety about the reviews. The Minister referred to the research study on disablement, and I shall deal with that matter in a moment. My hon. Friend's point is that we all recognise the difficulties and complexities of a system which tries to deal in a sensible manner with the actual problems faced by people. The preamble and general outline of the reviews that were being undertaken contained a dreadful jargon phrase to the effect that the Government were concerned to "reduce the individualising" of benefits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Newton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not guilty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am quite sure that it was not a concoction of the Minister's.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those who wonder what will come out of the reviews are alarmed. They fear that, although a simpler and clearer system may emerge, because the rules are so simple, clear and understandable, the system will fail to take into account the tremendous variation in people's circumstances and that many will suffer rather than benefit from the introduction of reforms following the reviews. The question of how far the system may be used to deal with the practicalities and individual circumstances of people who are in need of pensions and benefits is causing so much concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, I welcome the concessions that the Minister has made in drawing up the regulations. I also welcome his undertaking that some of those areas will be considered in the research study on disablement that is taking place over a rather longer scale than the reviews.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
