Draft Crown Agents Commencing Capital Debt Order 1984</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Overseas Development (Mr. Timothy Raison)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the draft Crown Agents Commencing Capital Debt Order 1984 be approved.</p></blockquote>
The purpose of the order is to extend by two years the period during which the Secretary of State has the power to determine whether, and if so at what rate, interest is payable on the Crown Agents' commencing capital debt.<br><br>
The Crown Agents were founded as long ago as 1833 to procure supplies for the colonies. Over the years the extent of their services widened but they had no legal or corporate status until 1 January 1980 when the Crown Agents Act 1979 came into effect. That Act established the Crown Agents as a statutory public corporation, under a board all of the members of which are appointed by the Secretary of State. The Act set out the nature and extent of the activities they were authorised to undertake and defined their financial and other duties and responsibilities.<br><br>
The new Crown Agents needed capital with which to fund their fixed assets and to provide them with working capital, and so section 17 of the Act made provision for a commencing capital debt to be assumed on the coming into existence of the new corporation. After a careful assessment of their financial needs, the amount of the commencing capital debt was set at £30 million. The debt was deemed to have been paid to the Crown Agents out of the National Loans Fund.<br><br>
Naturally the Crown Agents were required to service the debt, but since it was thought unlikely that they would be in a position to do so straightaway, the Act provided that during an initial period interest would be payable only to the extent determined by the Secretary of State. The initial period was set at five years, with provision for it to be extended by order to seven years, subject to the approval of the House.<br><br>
From the outset, the Crown Agents were able to pay some interest on their debt. In 1980 and 1981 they paid interest at 20 per cent. of the full National Loans Fund's rates applicable to the debt. In 1982 they paid at 40 per cent. and in 1983 at 60 per cent. of the full rates. Their strengthening financial position was such that it was expected that they would be able to pay at 80 per cent. of the full rate in 1984 and achieve full servicing of the debt in 1985.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
However, in the summer of 1983, the Government of Brunei unexpectedly took away from the Crown Agents the responsibility for the management of their substantial investment portfolio. The loss of income resulting from this decision not only halted the Crown Agents' progress towards full financial viability but presented them with serious problems as a result of which they feared they would be unable to meet their financial obligation under the Act.<br><br>
To cope with this, the Board of Crown Agents submitted to the Government proposals for a reorganisation of the business, designed to enable them to achieve financial viability not later than 1986. The proposals were concerned mainly with the adoption of measures conducive to cost-cutting and efficiency. While not significantly curtailing the range of the Crown Agents' activities, the measures included reduction in staff and the disposal of the Crown Agents' main offices at 4 Mill-bank.<br><br>
I informed the House on 23 February this year that the Government had decided broadly to endorse the proposals put forward by the Board of Crown Agents for reorganisation, with a view to privatisation in due course. Privatisation will require legislation and a number of questions of timing and method will need to be settled in due course. I also announced that, to facilitate the financing of this reorganisation, the Government intended to waive in full the interest due on the debt in 1984 and to seek parliamentary approval to make possible any waiver of interest which may be necessary in 1985 or 1986.<br><br>
Parliamentary approval is necessary because, under the terms of the Act, the initial period of five years during which interest can be waived in whole or in part expires on 31 December 1984 and can be extended to 31 December 1986 only by means of an order which is subject to an affirmative resolution of the House.<br><br>
I turn now to the detail of the order before the Committee.<br><br>
The order extends from five years to seven years, that is until 31 December 1986, the period, provided for in the Crown Agents Act, during which interest is payable on the commencing capital debt only to the extent that the Secretary of State determines.<br><br>
It is too early to judge whether the financial situation of the Crown Agents will permit them to make any interest payment on their debt in either 1985 or 1986, but the Government need to have available the power to grant a waiver, should this prove necessary. A decision on this will be taken in early 1985, and similarly in early 1986, when the Crown Agents' results for the preceding year are available.<br><br>
Regular payments of the outstanding capital of the debt, which at present stands at £19·4 million, will continue regardless of whether there are any waivers of interest. On this basis the total amount of interest at stake would be £2·4 million in 1985 and 2·3 million in 1986.<br><br>
It is probable, however, that the amount of the debt will be reduced during 1985 by part of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V008P0I0407">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
proceeds of the sale of the Crown Agents' Millbank office which it is hoped will have been completed by then. The amount of interest to be foregone in the event of any waiver being granted is, therefore, likely to be somewhat lower than the figures which I quoted a moment ago.<br><br>
I believe that it is right that we should take this step; it is in Britain's interest for the Crown Agents to achieve full financial viability and to continue to serve Britain and the developing world, and I therefore commend the order to the Committee.</span></p>
<p>10.35 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stuart Holland <span class='memberconstituency'>(Vauxhall)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are well aware of the chequered record of the Crown Agents. My right hon. Friend the Member for Clydesdale (Dame J. Hart) found that the future of the Crown Agents was the first item on her desk when she became Minister of Overseas Development in 1974. As her adviser at that time, it was also the first issue that I was called upon to view.<br><br>
I trust that the Committee will say that the grave difficulties which property speculation caused for the Crown Agents are behind them and that the measures taken by my right hon. Friend the Member for Clydesdale in the period up to 1980 have been, in principle or in practice, endorsed Ly the Government since. I hope that we will not need to spend much time on that aspect of the past.<br><br>
Perhaps the Minister will confirm that in January 1980 the Crown Agents were paying an interest rate of 14.25 per cent. and, on other balances, 15·25 per cent. It is quite clear that the debt structure which the Crown Agents inherited is a considerable burden on their operations for various reasons. First, evidently, there was the loss of the management of the Brunei portfolio, which was substantial. Not only was the scale of the reserves in excess of some £3 billion, as I understand it, but they brought an income of £3 million or so to the Crown Agents and performed a flywheel function for them on several of their other operations. We are not suggesting that the Crown Agents were cross-subsidising other activities from that Brunei order. None the less, the regularity of the income enabled them to undertake certain activities which we regarded as highly positive. Especially, there were training facilities for those concerned with projects and moving to the margin with certain development projects which, on a standard discounted cost plus accounting framework, might not have been considered viable.<br><br>
That gave us an economic and entrepreneurial space for the Crown Agents which was in the development context. Granted that that role was and has been so positive, we would not wish to see them circumscribed or strait-jacketed by the interest rate terms. In that respect, we have no objection to the extension of the period to seven years.<br><br>
The Minister did not refer to, but I believe that it is worth stressing, the positive role which the Crown Agents have played not only in relation to other countries' development, where it is much appreciated that they are trustworthy and free from the corrupting influence which sometimes accompanies foreign contracts, but because a sizeable
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
proportion—about 80 per cent.—of their orders are placed in the United Kingdom which is of considerable value to small and medium enterprises. I understand that in 1980–83 they averaged approximately £40 million each year and that individual orders meant contract work with almost 100 companies, many of them small. There were 9,300 orders, valued at £7 million, placed with non-listed companies during the same period. These companies would have found it most difficult to enter into that type of contractual relationship with foreign Governments on major projects, and in this respect the Crown Agents have acted as intermediary, entrepreneurial as well as financial, and with considerable effect, over the long term in our view, despite the unfortunate events of the early 1970s.<br><br>
More basic issues arise regarding the financing than simply the rolling over of the period of the interest. One is whether in due course the Crown Agents might be able to benefit from public dividend capital. I do not wish to make a party point here, but I am aware that my hon. Friend the Member for Clydesdale decided against it, with the Treasury. at the time, which is why the Crown Agents have been landed with a fixed interest debt, as opposed to—with public dividend capital—their being able to pass the interest on a given year like an ordinary operating company.<br><br>
In the long term, the possibility of public dividend capital should not be excluded. I do not wish to be more explicit at this stage, partly because there are so many uncertainties about the medium-term future of the Crown Agents, as the Minister said. The Government are planning privatisation in due course—which is at least as long as a piece of string. We hope that this piece of string is very long.<br><br>
An alternative to finance is whether, instead of outright privatisation, a joint venture arrangement might be negotiated or fulfilled with the World Bank, for example, because it is clear that, increasingly, the Crown Agents are acting as intermediaries not only for the United Kingdom Government but also for international institutions such as the World Bank, which itself does not have a massive operating arm in the field, and it is arguable that it should have. Will the Minister say whether he is considering this, and what the state of play is?<br><br>
Overall, therefore, we feel that the Crown Agents play a positive role in Britain's aid programme. There are interesting new developments in its relationship with international public institutions, and certainly its record is highly esteemed and valued by Commonwealth Governments especially. However, as regards privatisation, about which we have heard little so far, there are key questions to be asked.<br><br>
If the Crown Agents retain their public status I understand that they could be in a position to repay some of their capital debt. The Minister spoke of the Millbank premises, and I shall return to that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I loathe stopping the hon. Gentleman because he is making an important
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V008P0I0408">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
speech and rightly picking up points that the Minister laid down. But I am afraid that he has himself given a hostage to fortune in saying that the Minister referred to these issues very briefly and in passing. It has become a habit during statutory instrument debates for ministerial speeches to lay down a series of markers and go rather broad. Therefore, it is only reasonable that hon. Members such as the hon. Member for Vauxhall (Mr. Holland) should reply, and we appreciate and are enjoying what he is saying. Equally, as the occupant of the Chair, I must lay down a big marker for the Chair that if these interesting little Committees get wildly out of order we shall degenerate into something like certain well-known Committees in other parts of the building.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Holland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With unqualified respect for the Chair, Sir John, may I say that you will note the serried ranks behind me of those who wish to contribute to the debate? I feel, therefore, that there is no serious risk of our continuing till lunchtime.<br><br>
The point that I was about to raise—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Again, I should love to go on until lunchtime, but there is no fear of that. However, it is dangerous for the Chair to allow hon. Members—especially those on the Front Benches—to get too far out of order, though it is important that they get a little out of order. But this is becoming a rounded debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Holland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I said that the Opposition had no objection in principle to the extension of the period for the payment of interest—from five to seven years. However, that is subject to the Minister's answers to certain questions. For example, if the Crown Agents retained their public status, I understand that they could repay some of the capital. That is relevant to the time period in which the interest would be repaid.<br><br>
However, if the Crown Agents are made a private, limited company, or even privatised in a para-governmental sense by becoming a limited company in which the Government are shareholders as they might be with British Leyland, the board will have to become a licensed deposit taker. That could involve it in receiving considerable capital sums—of £5 million, £6 million or £7 million. That is significant to what the Minister said about the possible sale of the Millbank site. Those sums would be a significant share of the value of the sale of that site.<br><br>
We are worried that, by waiving or extending dividend repayments, the Government may be doing a cosmetic job simply to facilitate the privatisation of the Crown Agents. Clearly, they are not British Telecom and will not raise £3·5 billion on the market, nor are they British Airways. With international air travel or transatlantic travel, the Goverment can come to an agreement on a fares structure. But they cannot influence the revenue of the Crown Agents by such an agreement. They are in a competitive environment and have to compete internationally.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
We hope that the Minister will consider avoiding the need for the Crown Agents to become a licensed deposit taker, and thereby pre-empt the issue of a sum of up to £7 million.<br><br>
However, we must consider other issues. The Minister has said there will be privatisation "in due course", but in one sense it is already occurring without being reported to the House. I do not think that the House had discussed any of these issues either in Committee or on the Floor. The stamps and coin division of the Crown Agents is a profitable business. The US partners pulled out of its international activities and Stanley Gibbons came in, resulting in a 60:40 joint venture between Stanley Gibbons and the Crown. Agents. I understand that that was done quickly over the weekend before the Conservative party conference at Blackpool, and that staff were told on the Monday that there would be redundancies.<br><br>
Is Parliament to be informed of those activities? In practice, privatisation is taking place, and that is relevant to whether Parliament would wish to assent to the rolling over of the period on interest repayments.<br><br>
We also understand that there is a 50:50 joint venture arrangements in relation to the trade services limited company with Lloyd's. We are not opposed in principle to joint ventures in specific circumstances, but proposals for joint ventures involving public bodies such as the Crown Agents should be put before Parliament.<br><br>
In their engineering inspection department, the key role of the Crown Agents is quality assurance. Where less developed countries cannot send inspectors round factories that make components, the Crown Agents have a key role to play.<br><br>
We understand that it was again considered whether quality assurance should be a private-public joint venture. These are considerable activities which should be subject to the scrutiny of the House. I should like to ask the Minister to make a commitment that such privatisation proposals will be put before the House, because otherwise it will be initiated by the back door rather than the front door. The House does not like back-door privatisation any more than it likes back-door nationalisation.<br><br>
What will happen to the Millbank property itself, which is only a few yards down the embankment from here? Will Parliament me consulted on what happens to it? It has been said that it might be sold to a hotel group and become the site of a luxury hotel. Does not Parliament have an interest in whether there is to be a luxury hotel only a few yards from the House? We are told that the Serjeant at Arms has said that—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Cash <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stafford)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir John. I fail to see any relevance to the order in what the hon. Gentleman is saying. Will you be kind enough to rule on the matter?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have already ruled. I realise that Members of both Front Benches make use of matters in a rounded way, but I think that the hon. Gentleman is getting rather too round.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V008P0I0409">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Holland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Committee knows that it is the convention and the practice of the House that Front Benches are consulted on whether an issue should be discussed in Committee or on the Floor of the House. I am unwilling to propose that we debate this matter on the Floor of the House, but, if there is not to be a challenge which is in itself reasonable because so many unanswered questions accompany the measure under discussion, I might have to reconsider my recommendation to my party colleagues about what should be done. However, as I have only a couple more points to make, I am sure, Sir John, that there will be no difficulty.<br><br>
The Millbank property is within walking distance of the House, and some hon. Members have proposed that it might be used for Members' office space.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is becoming intolerable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Holland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suggest, none the less, that we address ourselves to the staffing of the Crown Agents, because our consent to the order also involves assurances about staffing. In general, Crown Agents employees have civil servant status, some have index-linked—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sorry. I have asked the hon. Gentleman three times, and I have been most tolerant. These matters are not within the framework of the order or anything to do with it. The hon. Gentleman may, of course, deal with them en passant, but he must not go into them in depth, and clearly this is what he now seeks to do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Holland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have just said that I am not planning to go into these matters in depth, Sir John. I have but two points to raise, one of which is the status of staff employed by the Crown Agents. Some have civil servant status, some do not. How long will this anomaly continue?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman must raise the issue in the proper place. This is not the time or place. He must not deal with staff and their status and pensions here. It is not part of the order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Holland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With respect, Sir John, not only is it a convention of the House but it is the essence of the House that if moneys are to be voted and approved, the House should express its view on how that money is used. I submit that the staffing conditions of the Crown Agents is a directly relevant issue.<br><br>
The Minister referred to privatisation "in due course". If the Government expect us to agree to orders such as this, we deserve answers on these issues. It is clear that the staff are demoralised. They do not know whether they will be able to continue with their previous status, or have new status. This is a matter about which we ought to have a reply.<br><br>
Finally, I turn to the role of the Crown Agents in Ethiopia. As I understand it, the Crown Agents wished to help to put together an aid package—a Hercules package—for Ethiopia. Given the recent publicity about it, we should be glad to have the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
Minister's comments on whether it is so and whether ODA has agreed, and if not, why not.</span></p>
<p>10.54 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must be careful about how I respond to the hon. Gentleman's speech. I will try to confine myself to the points that seem most relevant to the order.<br><br>
I am, of course, most pleased that the hon. Gentleman, who speaks with the authority of a former adviser on these matters, has endorsed the order. In spite of his other comments, he accepts that the order is necessary and, for many reasons, perhaps that is all I need say. I am happy to echo his tribute to the Crown Agents. They have faced up to considerable difficulties in a determined way.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman spoke of finding an entrepreneurial space, and I believe that he used that phrase in a commending sense. Privatisation would, of course, enlarge the entrepreneurial space available for the Crown Agents, which is the real point of the exercise.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked about the rate of interest being paid by the Crown Agents, and I confirm that that rate was 14·5 per cent. As for capitalisation and deposit taking, the timing and method of privatisation and the future capital structure of the Crown Agents have not yet been settled. The privatised Crown Agents will need an adequate capital base for their activities as they will include taking deposits from their principals. I cannot say more about that, partly because it is still evolving and is not directly relevant to the order.<br><br>
There is a possibility of a joint venture with the World Bank, and, of course, the Crown Agents already work with it. We have not considered the World Bank as a partner in the privatisation process and I believe that that would be a rather unusual activity for the bank. Therefore, I doubt whether anything will come of that possibility. However, I note what the hon. Gentleman said about it.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman mentioned Millbank, but I believe that you, Sir John, felt that that was outside the scope of the order. I merely say that I believe it is a matter for the Crown Agents to handle themselves. The objective has been to put them on a more commercial basis whether they remain in the public sector or in due course go into the private sector, but we should not breathe down their necks. They have been given a clear target, and their objective is to get on with it, so it would not be right for me to interfere by commenting publicly on how they carry that out.<br><br>
I believe that I have dealt with the essential points, and I end by repeating that the order is useful. I hope that the Committee will accept it.</span></p>
