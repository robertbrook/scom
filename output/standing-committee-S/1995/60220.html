	<p>[MR. MICHAEL J. MARTIN 	<i>in the Chair]</i></p>

	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Licensing (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That, during the further proceedings on the Licensing (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and half-past Four o'clock— 	<i>[Lord James Douglas-Hamilton.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 1</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>LICENSING CONDITIONS FOR RAVES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McFall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 3, in page 1, line 8, leave out 'in making' and insert 'to make'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 5, in page 1, line 9, leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>'have regard to the need to'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment applies to the Bill as it was originally envisaged, before the Government tabled new clause 1. It is not relevant to discuss new clause 1 at this stage. The Government have made huge concessions, and I thank them for considering this issue so constructively. The aim of the amendments is to ensure that licensing boards have a duty to impose byelaws. Currently, only 43 of the 56 licensing boards in Scotland have taken up byelaws resulting from the Licensing (Scotland) Act 1976. If the clause did not include such a duty, there would be a lack of uniformity, and the amendment was tabled in that spirit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member makes a good point in the theme that he has adopted. I make it clear that I accept the principle of the amendments. They would impose a duty on licensing boards to make byelaws attaching conditions to a licence for the purpose of safeguarding those attending the types of events covered by the Bill. We accept the case for accommodating that point, along with certain other concerns expressed during the sittings at which we took evidence, and we have responded to that point in new clause 1, which we will be debating shortly. I hope that the hon. Member will withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 4, in page 1, line 9, after 'to', insert '(a)'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>116</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 8, in page 1, line 11, after 'applies', insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'and</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(b) ensure that adequate precautions are in place to discourage misuse of drugs in the premises'.</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>No. 10, in page 1, line 17, after 'applies', insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'and to provide adequate precautions to discourage the misuse of drugs at any event to which this section applies'.</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments are consequential. Amendment No. 8 would require byelaws to provide anti-drug measures because it was felt by many, particularly those from whom we took evidence, that more could be done through measures designed to discourage the misuse of drugs. The all-party campaign, Scotland Against Drugs, which was established by the Government, could take part in that. With that in mind, I should like to Minister to consider the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the principle of the amendments. They seek to make it clear that the purpose of the measures is to discourage drug misuse. When the Law Society of Scotland gave evidence to the Committee, its view, which was shared by the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, was that that objective could be achieved by obliging boards to attach conditions to the licence for that purpose. We recognised the case for accommodating that concern and have done so in new clause 1, which we will come to before long. I hope that, in those circumstances, the hon. Member will withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 6, in page 1, line 10, after 'health', insert 'and safety'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may take amendment No. 9, in page 1, line 16, after 'health', insert 'and safety'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 9 is consequential. Amendment No. 6 was put down to require licensing boards to make byelaws which safeguard not only the health of persons at raves but their safety. We saw that deficiency in the Bill and it is being corrected with new clause 1—safeguarding only the health of persons attending raves is insufficient. It is questionable whether providing adequate exits, ensuring that properly training and regulated stewards are in attendance and providing for closed circuit television monitoring falls within the parameters of safeguarding health. Accordingly, the broadening of the provisions to include safety is necessary. I am delighted that the Government have taken that on board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment. Members of the Committee will know that health, safety and welfare legislation in relation to workplaces has been in place for many years. Welfare hardly comes into it when dealing with a place where people go for entertainment for only a few hours, but there is a commonsense need to add on safety as well as health
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0718">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>117</span>
to ensure that premises owners have regard to every aspect of a person's safety. There could be much more danger from a fire breaking out and there being a lack of exits than, possibly, from drugs. People who never take drugs might still be in danger on such premises. There can be no doubt about the value of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There will be no substantial debate on the amendment, because I accept in principle what the hon. Members for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) and for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) have proposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would extend the requirement on licensing boards to have regard to the health and safety of those attending the events covered by the Bill. We acknowledge the strong case for accommodating those concerns and, again, have done so in new clause 1. I hope that the amendment will be withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 7, in page 1, line 10, leave out 'events' and insert 'raves or other gatherings'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may take the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 11, in page 1, line 18, leave out 'event' and insert 'rave or other gathering'.</p>
	<p>No. 12, in page 1, line 21, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(aa) at which 100 persons or more are in attendance'.</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>No. 13, in page 1, line 22, after 'which', insert 'amplified'.</p>
	<p>No. 14, in page 1, line 22, after 'relayed', insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'during the night (with or without intermission) and'.</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>No. 15, in page 1, leave out lines 23 to 25.</p>
	<p>No. 18, in page 2, leave out lines 19 and 20.</p>
	<p>No. 22, in page 2, line 23, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'"rave" includes any gathering as described in subsection (3) above.'.</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>No. 1, in title, line 3, leave out 'events' and insert 'raves or other gatherings'.</p>
	<p>No. 2, in title, line 4, leave out 'and dancing'.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is consequential. Amendment No. 11 was put down to ensure that the provisions of new section 38A apply specifically to raves. We had quite a debate on Second Reading in Glasgow and at the evidence sittings at Stirling, Ayr and Inverness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Among other things, we discussed the definition of an event. The view of the official Opposition and a number of witnesses was that the definition in new section 38A is vague, open to various interpretations and applicable to a number of situations not generally considered to be raves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The definition could refer to many forms of organised entertainment, including discos or other dances. On Second Reading, I mentioned the White Heather club. The White Heather phenomenon still exists, so I ask the Minister to think seriously about that argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>118</span>
Insufficient progress has been made even though new clause 1 has been tabled. The definition bears little relationship to the definition of raves in section 63 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, which provides that a rave is a gathering of 100 persons or more, takes place in the open air, has amplified music played at night and causes distress in the locality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is designed to relate to new section 38A of the 1994 Act. Modifications have been made to the main elements of the 1994 Act definition to take account of the fact that the Bill affects licensed premises.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously we all made our own interpretation of what was said to us as we went around the country taking evidence. I welcome the notice that has been taken of that evidence by Committee members of all parties. I do not think that we should home in on the work "rave" in our definition of events, because the problems extend far wider. I am happy with the wording of new clause 1, which we should discuss in the not-too-distant future. The definition in the amendment would be restrictive and it would be better to leave it out, as was suggested by a number of those who gave evidence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support amendment No. 15. It would delete subsection (3) (c), which refers to an event
	<br><blockquote><p>"which consists of or includes the opportunity for persons attending the event to engage in dancing".</p></blockquote>
Subsection (5) then defines dancing. Those definitions are irrelevant because people could be getting drugged to the eyeballs without dancing a step all night. Those of us who have enjoyed dancing in the past and hope to enjoy it in the future might feel that reference to it was completely irrelevant. It would be sensible to remove it from the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the Committee's permission, I shall deal with all the amendments together, because they are related. The 10 amendments would introduce a rigid definition of a rave and restrict that definition in a number of ways. I am concerned that they would severely restrict the practical impact of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The policy intention behind the Bill, as I am sure hon. Members will all appreciate, is to introduce safeguards for the people who attend events in licensed premises. Amendments Nos. 1, 7, 11 and 22 would introduce a definition of a rave to clause 1 and make it refer to "raves and other gatherings" instead of the neutral word "events". That would restrict the application of the clause. It does not matter what the event is called as long as the Bill ensures that all events, regardless of their name, that may pose a risk to the health of patrons are covered by the new provisions. I am therefore extremely wary of using the word "rave" in the Bill because it would restrict the type of event to which the clause applies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several of the witnesses who gave evidence to the Special Standing Committee, in particular the Scottish Drugs Forum and the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland, also said that the word "rave" should not be used to define events. The meaning of the word "rave" has changed over the past few years and it may just as easily change again. We should therefore avoid using a word that could soon change or even become obsolete. By simply describing the three characteristics of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0719">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>119</span>
events that boards may make conditions to regulate, the Bill provides a framework within which boards can define more precisely the activity that they intend to control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 2, 15 and 18 would all delete references to dancing in clause 1. I hope to persuade hon. Members that they are unnecessary. I believe that the amendments have been suggested out of a concern that the reference to dancing will exclude so-called concert-type raves from the operation of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am advised that a concert-type rave is one at which people go along primarily to listed to a band or to admire the skills of a disc jockey.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Name one disc jockey!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are too many to name.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to draw hon. Members' attention to the definition of dancing that appears in new clause 1:
	<br><blockquote><p>"'dancing' includes any movement apparently to the accompaniment of music".</p></blockquote>
That would include the movements of people tapping their feet or nodding their heads to the performance. I assure hon. Members that attendees of concert-type raves also engage in what we would consider to be more conventional dancing of the modern type. Therefore, the reference to dancing is not unduly restrictive: it is an important feature of the Bill. We want to regulate events that pose a threat to health. They are primarily dance events, at which frenetic dancing often, but not necessarily exacerbated by drug misuse, leads to exhaustion and dehydration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 12, 13 and 14 would introduce new restrictions to the definition of the type of event to which clause 1 applies. The result of that is that some potentially dangerous dance events are not caught by the new provisions. The three amendments would bring the definition of 'rave' in clause 1 more into line with the definition of "rave" used in section 63 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994. But for what purpose?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions of the 1994 Act were designed to deal with large, noisy outdoor gatherings at night that were likely to cause a public nuisance and cause distress to local residents. The definition in the 1994 Act— a minimum attendance requirement of 100, music that is amplified and played at night—reflect that. In contrast the Bill is designed to introduce safeguards for the health of people who attend dance events of whatever size in licensed premises. Because they may not be held outdoors and smaller numbers may attend, those events do not necessarily present public nuisance problems. The definition in the 1994 Act is simply not appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Applying a minimum attendance requirement could exclude a good number of smaller venues, especially pubs, from having to meet the conditions imposed by the licensing boards. Applying requirements that music must be amplified and played at night would also exclude events, because music is not necessarily amplified at an indoor event and because such events can be held during the day. Our policy is to encourage best practice in all clubs and pubs, not to provide a let-out for certain organisers or venues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>120</span>
With those explanations, I hope that the hon. Member for Dumbarton will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we come to a vote—if we do— I would like to press the Minister about dancing. It is irrelevant whether anything that could be described as dancing goes on at the event or venue. The Minister sounded a bit like a judge who asks who the Beatles are, or what a T-shirt is. Many a lawyer could have an entertaining time defining whether someone was dancing when that question was irrelevant to the issue. It reminds me of an ancient story from the Glasgow police courts. A witness said that the band was playing the "Moonlight Saunter". The judge asked, "Don't you mean the 'Moonlight Sonata'?" The witness replied, "No, the 'Moonlight Saunter'—it's a dance."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a danger of being out of touch with those who attend the events. None of us is likely to attend an event that could be remotely described as a rave, but if we include dancing in the measure, we could show ourselves to be out of touch with young people's ideas of how to have fun and enjoy themselves. What is the point of including dancing in the measure? We would lose nothing by excluding all references to dancing. We would make it clear that we were trying to protect young people from drug dealers and prevent them from bringing drugs into premises. It would not matter if dancing took place there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to examine the word "dancing". No member of the Committee would object to Scottish country dancing, but such an event would not be relevant to the Bill. I shall reconsider the matter, and table an amendment, if necessary, on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like the Minister to consider the matter further. We could find ourselves in an absurd predicament. If I followed the Minister correctly, he said that tapping feet or drumming fingers is equivalent to dancing. So we could legitimately say that in this Standing Committee in Room 12 a few of us have spoken and a few have danced. Surely that definition is absurd and the Minister should reconsider it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously that is not so, and the hon. Member for Dumbarton is being a little light-hearted; obviously, the definition requires music. The Bill considers guidelines for dance events. I do not think that the Bill can encompass all licensed premises. The definition offered by the hon. Member for Maryhill would effectively provide a controlling factor for pubs. But licensing authorities would already have sufficient control over pubs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Bill was introduced, I had the impression that we were talking about situations in which young people dance. The definition is right and proper, unless the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to look again at that point.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not aware that copies are in the Room. I was interested to find that it seems more difficult to get copies of Scottish licensing Acts in the Library than to find English legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want it to be clear to the Minister that the best way to prevent the misuse of drugs in any premises is to stop them getting in; whether people drum their figures, gyrate or make what are called modern rap music movements— which appear to have nothing to do with dance but involve pointing fingers and gesticulating in various directions and singing in an atonal fashion—is not the problem. The problem is that people get drugs into premises. Therefore, the Minister should focus on preventing the entry of drugs into premises, which has more to do with stewarding and self-policing by those who run establishments than with what happens when people are inside them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members may recall that I have previously given my daughter's description of her boyfriend, a DJ who does house and garage music. He does not take drugs, or even drink, but he dances all night long at various clubs in Scotland, and enjoys himself. If he is fit and healthy and has no heart condition, he is not likely to die of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By chance, however, people might be able to bring drugs into that scene and pass them in an adulterated form. I believe that people at raves often pass bottles of water to each other and receivers do not know what they are taking in them. That is why young people buy a bottle of water when they go into the clubs. It is not because of the club owners doing anything to get money, but because young people like to have their own bottle; when they have finished it, they can go to taps and fill it up and keep their own bottle. They are worried about people adulterating the water that passes round in those places.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will look not only at what gyrating and other movements constitute dancing but, and more closely, at the powers that licence holders must take to prevent people coming into premises with drugs or having taken drugs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that. The first line of defence against drugs, and, for that matter, against offensive weapons, being brought into a venue, is efficient stewarding and searching. Everyone entering an event should be subject to a search of outer clothing, pockets and bags. Body searches should, wherever possible, be complemented by the use of metal detectors to discourage the carrying of weapons. Notices should be displayed at the entrance, stating that patrons will be asked to submit to a search, that the police will be informed if individuals are found to be in possession of drugs or weapons, and that such persons will be refused entry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The queue outside the venue should be supervised by closed circuit television or by stewards, to discourage drug dealing. Stewards should regularly patrol the venue, including toilet areas, to look out for signs of drug
	<span class='label label-info column'>122</span>
dealing, disturbance or distress, and prominent notices should state that persons suspected of possessing or supplying drugs or offensive weapons will be asked to leave. Police surveillance might be appropriate for larger events. All those measures are detailed further in the "Guidelines of Good Practice at Dance Events".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find it ridiculous that the Minister speaks of people who may be in possession of drugs or weapons being asked to leave. I hope that they will be asked to leave in the back of a police van.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly, I accept that. However, if stewarding were effective, those people would not get in in the first place. The point about putting up notices is important. The notices are a deterrent, which is preferable to a struggle with stewards. It is better to discourage crime before it gets off the ground.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I mentioned, the measures are detailed in the "Guidelines of Good Practice at Dance Events". We all know that something as small as an ecstasy tablet is easy to conceal, but a firm and consistent policy of searching, ejection and reporting to the police should reduce the availability of drugs at such events.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 16, in page 2, line 1, leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>'at which it appears to the board'</p></blockquote>
and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'in respect of which the board has reasonable suspicion'.</p></blockquote>
This issue was brought up by several witnesses during the Committee's sittings in Scotland. The amendment would replace the phrasing in the new clause 38A(3)(d) that the Bill would insert into the Licensing (Scotland) Act 1976—which states that the measure applies to an event where
	<br><blockquote><p>"it appears to the board"</p></blockquote>
that drugs might be misused—with phrasing that refers to the licensing board's having "reasonable suspicion". The Law Society of Scotland, and others, said that to minimise the risk that the licensing board's decisions would be subject to judicial review, new section 38A(3)(d) should provide that the board should have reasonable suspicion that offences might occur. Sheriff Neil Gow, in Ayr, and John Loudon, in Inverness, both made relevant comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sheriff Gow said that he was concerned about the wording in the Bill. In his opinion the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"at which it appears to the board"</p></blockquote>
were "wide and indefinite". He understood why that phrasing had been used, but he anticipated that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the licensing board of a specific region would receive information from various sources"</p></blockquote>
including the police. 	<i>[Interruption.] </i>He wondered
	<br><blockquote><p>"how that information would be presented to the board"</p></blockquote>
and stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"What cannot happen and would give grounds for an appeal to the sheriff would be if information were surreptitiously passed to the chairman of the licensing board, who considered it and mentioned it to other members of the board, although it was not put before the

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. A Member of Parliament is addressing the Committee and conversations should not go on in the vicinity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Loudon, at Inverness, said that he was concerned about the drafting of the Bill. He believed that a better expression would be "reasonable suspicion". He felt that the definition would otherwise be too wide and could easily catch or encompass almost every type of function held in hotels and licensed premises. He added that if a licensing board made general byelaws he could easily see that provision sweeping in more than had originally been envisaged. I know that the matter has not been attended to in new clause 1. Could the Minister consider the remarks that I have made and respond to them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment. I am sure that when the Bill was drafted it was probably not intended that the words which the amendment seeks to replace should appear. It was merely a broadbrush attempt to say what was meant. It might be admitted that the words in amendment No. 16 fit the needs of the Bill more accurately. New section 38A(3)(d) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"at which it appears to the board that offences may be committed in relation to controlled drugs".</p></blockquote>
That is an extremely broadbrush approach. Offences may be committed almost anywhere at any time. It is far too wide an expression and could be held to be unfair and even damaging to civil liberties if people chose to be difficult about it. It could make life difficult for those who were doing no harm at all. The phrase in amendment No. 16 puts more accurately and would ensure that matters were conducted fairly and reasonably. I hope that the Minister can accept that wording.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill provides a framework within which local authorities will be able to identify relevant events. That is quite deliberate. It is intended to achieve flexibility for local authorities to address a problem whose nature may well change over time. It also sets out the requirement in terms with which licensing boards will be familiar. The purpose of the amendment would appear to be designed to restrict that discretion and introduce a test which is not now common in local government terms. We do not think that it is necessarily appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the nature of the problem, it is important that boards are given wide flexible discretion. As long as that flexible discretion is exercised reasonably there should be nothing for licensees to fear. If it is exercised unreasonably, licensees will have a remedy in the court. Furthermore, licensing boards will recognise a requirement drafted in this way and it can reasonably be expected that the boards will be able to respond more positively to terminology with which they are acquainted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am reluctant to accept that amendment, particularly as we have not been able to assess COSLA's views. I hope that hon. Members will accept my argument, recognise the benefit of the existing proposal and not press the
	<span class='label label-info column'>124</span>
amendment. I am prepared to consult COSLA on this point. If necessary I shall return to it on Report. But it seems that licensing boards might have substantial reservations as the provision might make it very much harder for them to refuse applications. I could expand on that if hon. Members wish. I should like to consult COSLA before taking any action and, depending on its evidence, I might return to the issue on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased with the Minister's response to the amendment. He knows that both the solicitor representing hoteliers and licensed premises, and Sheriff Neil Gow made this point. It is very reassuring, that he is referring the matter back to COSLA. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 17, in page 2, line 14, leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>'as are specified by such person'.</p></blockquote>
The amendment would clarify new section 38A(4)(c) by ensuring that any byelaws can contain conditions determined by the boards rather than by an individual appointed by the boards. It should be up to the licensing boards to determine the conditions to be included. There is no justification for restricting the local viewpoint in such a way and for allowing boards to delegate the power to individuals who are not defined in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In giving evidence at Inverness, Mr. Loudon said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Because 'such person' is not defined in the Bill it seemed to us that if a board were making conditions it should be up to it how it does that and from whom it gets its information. The licence holder should really have nothing to do with that. If one went to an appeal one would be appealing against the decision of the board. I do not suppose that one would want to take advice from the chief constable or the fire master or environmental health officers and involve them in the appeal. One would simply want to deal with the board."</p></blockquote>
Mr. Loudon then asserted that the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"as are specified by such person"</p></blockquote>
are unnecessary
	<br><blockquote><p>"because if the board has the discretion and the right to include conditions it will be up to it to decide what it wants to do."</p></blockquote>
This is a concern because we do not know who this person is, what his or her qualifications will be and what his or her attitude is to licensed premises, drink and young people. It would be safe in all circumstances to leave that discretion to local democracy and the licensing boards. I should like the Minister to consider those points very seriously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that licensing boards do not abdicate their responsibility to others for ensuring that proper conditions are imposed on the licence. Licensing boards already rely, quite rightly, on the advice of chief constables, fire masters and other environmental interests when considering what conditions may be imposed on a licence under byelaws.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Granted, the proposal in the Bill goes a stage further by enabling boards to require the holder of the licence to meet such requirements as are specified by such persons—for example, the chief constable—as they determine. Indeed, the local authorities, by employing such a step for public entertainment licences granted under the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982, are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0722">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>125</span>
telling us that this helps them to respond properly to on-going situations. I am sure that boards will recognise, and make constructive use of, this power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are giving the licence holder a right of appeal against the terms of any condition imposed by a board and refusal of consent under clause l(4)(a). If a board decides to give discretion to, say, a chief constable to require certain things to be done under a condition attached to a licence, he may be subject to judicial review on the reasonable exercise of that discretion. However, in practical terms, I am sure that licensing boards would soon be criticised if they washed their hands of their responsibilities in this respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The boards have asked for significant discretion in this matter. We have given it to them because they have convinced us that that is what is needed to achieve the objective of controlling properly such dance events. The responsibility that comes with that discretion must be to exercise their powers sensibly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Gentleman is reassured by that explanation and will not press the amendment to a Division. I understand his points. I am prepared to consult COSLA further on the proposal and, depending on its reaction, I may return to it on Report. I shall, in any case, keep the hon. Gentleman informed. My impression is that the amendment is not necessary, but I shall consult COSLA further on it, and keep an open mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is interesting that the Minister will consult COSLA, but I should have thought that we should have listened more closely to the advice given to us by the representatives of Crew 2000, who came to give evidence in Stirling. They talked about the need for some kind of advisory committee—an organisation such as their own, which was on the ground, in and out of the dance scene on a regular basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment gives the Minister a chance to think about whom the board will take advice from. It worries me that we shall talk to more politicians and bureaucrats about something they are unlikely to have experience of apart from sitting as members of a licensing board considering at a distance the changing club and pub environment in which the young live. Crew 2000, an organisation of young people, worked to try to prevent young people getting into trouble through the use of drugs. Enhance works in the same sphere. They have told us that an advisory board should be set up for each area. Those are the sorts of organisation that licensing boards should consult when designing licensing conditions to make a safe environment for young people and prevent them from drug harm. With respect, I am not sure that COSLA is any closer to the dance scene—given the age of some colleagues with whom I served in local government—than the Minister or most members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister spoke about specific people, and mentioned chief constables. That is relevant but there should be others who could give more experienced and down-to-earth advice than chief constables. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will bear that in mind, and that he will talk to Crew 2000 to see whether it can offer suggestions for some sort of advisory board or person to inform boards, before they decide about specified conditions on any club licence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>126</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is asking for flexibility, and I agree with that, which is why the arrangements will allow for flexibility. Boards will be able to decide whom to approach for advice. We shall give guidance to boards on the effects of the Bill. It will include detailed guidance on the conditions and will provide the uniformity that many of the witnesses, including Sheriff Gow and the Scottish Drugs Forum, asked for. We envisage drawing on current best practice; the model conditions will be so framed as to include Sheriff Gow's recommendations. We shall consult widely on the models and on guidance before the arrangements are completed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Falkirk, East mentioned Crew 2000, which was most supportive. It wanted flexible definitions and requested that guidelines cover all clubs, regardless of the event. Its evidence was helpful to us in dealing with the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted that the Minister is to refer the matter to COSLA, which will delegate functions to the licensing boards of councils and receive information back from them. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 19, in page 2, line 28, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(2A) The Secretary of State shall within one month of the coming into force of this Act issue guidance on the application of this Act;</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(2B) The guidance to be issued under subsection (2A) above shall contain such conditions as the Secretary of State may determine and shall also include
	<ol>
	<li>guidance in relation to the description of raves or gatherings to which section 38A of the 1976 Act applies; and</li>
	<li>guidance in respect of the nature of the conditions which a licensing board should apply to safeguard the health and safety of persons attending events to which section 38A of the 1976 Act applies'.</li></ol></p></blockquote>
The amendment would give the Secretary of State a duty to issue guidance to licensing boards about the application of the legislation. The reason is that the Secretary of State's initiatives, including Scotland Against Drugs, ensure that he has access to information, expertise and the views of interested parties. Licensing boards do not have that access. Our amendment would ensure that the boards had the same access as the Secretary of State to that information, in usable form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sheriff Neil Gow said, in response to my question at the evidence session in Ayr, that I had
	<br><blockquote><p>"identified a major problem that goes to the heart of the Bill."</p></blockquote>
He continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Perhaps the House should look more closely into the situation and make it mandatory for local boards to adopt…model conditions."</p></blockquote>
He also said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I should like those conditions to be made mandatory; otherwise, there is little point in the Bill, and the Scottish Office might have to come back later with a different or stronger form of legislation."— 	<i>[Official Report, Special Standing Committee, </i>30 January 1996; c. 52–3.]</p></blockquote>
Given those strong comments from Sheriff Neil Gow, I hope that the Minister will ensure that the model conditions for licensing boards are mandatory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Member for Dumbarton. I also listened carefully to Sheriff Gow and to a number of others who expressed similar views. Frequent references were made to the "Guidelines for Good Practice at Dance Events" and, to take up the point made by the hon. Member for Falkirk, East, the guidelines are based on the experiences of many young people. To build guidelines along those lines and to put them into practice would be very welcome. As the hon. Member for Dumbarton suggested, the guidelines should be mandatory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike Watson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I too support the views of my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton and of the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie). The guidelines were referred to several times during the evidence-taking sittings and not a negative word was said about them. They contain a particularly useful and apt description of a dance event. As the Minister said, there are all sorts of difficulties in defining that, but the description in the guidelines may assist us. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A dance event can be described as an event where dance music is played continuously and mixed by DJs into an apparently seamless sequence. Events may also include personal appearance by live dance music acts. The nature and tempo (measured in beats per minute) of different kinds of music varies greatly."</p></blockquote>
That is helpful in defining a rave event.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the Minister's point that what are now known as raves may, in the next year or so, be called something entirely different by the next generation of teenagers and those in their early 20s. Therefore, we need flexibility in relation to the word "rave".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The commonsense advice in the Scottish Drugs Forum guidelines should be given more weight. In the past few days, Glasgow district council's licensing committee has publicly stated that it will not encourage dance venues and promoters to provide so-called chill-out areas because, in its view, that would be seen to endorse and encourage a culture of drugtaking. I have made my views on that clear to the licensing committee: I believe that its view is misguided and unhelpful. The example shows how licensing authorities will interpret the law differently if it is left open and if guidelines, such as those suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton, are not in place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will respond positively to the amendment. As far as possible, we want the provisions to apply uniformly to events across Scotland. It will not be helpful if it is easier to obtain a licence and to act less responsibly in some areas than in others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment refers to the health and safety of persons attending events. Such a consideration must be uppermost in our minds and in those licensing authorities when they consider applications. I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can certainly accept the amendment in principle, but it seeks not just to ensure that guidelines will be issued timeously. I repeat the commitment that I gave to the Special Standing Committee that we will ensure that guidance is available in order to assist boards in implementing the Bill's provisions and in providing for a measure of consistency. If the purpose of the amendment is to ensure consistency,
	<span class='label label-info column'>128</span>
I cannot see how it could achieve that objective because there appears to be no requirement for action from the boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have considered carefully the concerns raised about the possibility of some boards not applying appropriate conditions when it was reasonable for them to do so under the obligation that will be placed upon them. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Central (Mr. Watson) cited the example of the Glasgow licensing board deciding that it might not apply chill-out areas and he argued that there should be consistency throughout Scotland. We shall deal with that problem by introducing an amendment on Report to enable the Secretary of State to make an order prescribing minimum conditions that boards must attach to licences to fulfil the policy in the Bill. That should meet the hon. Gentlemen's point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Guidance on the Bill's effects will be issued. I shall write to the hon. Members before Report stage stating the sort of conditions that might be made under the powers in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have provided sufficient assurance to allay hon. Members' concerns, and that the hon. Gentleman will therefore withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that you, Mr. Martin, like me, have had time to read the minutes of the Special Standing Committee. It is always welcome when Conservative Members, especially the hon. Member for Ayr, have to do back-flips. The hon. Gentleman did his so gracefully that I would award him nine and a half out of ten for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was clear from the evidence that the Government had got it dramatically wrong and, when that happens, it is the job of politicians to point it out, no matter how discomforting it may be. Although the leaders of the four parties in Scotland meet regularly to deal with matters, we should not simply ignore what is being done when we are trying to pass legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that before Report stage he would send us another letter—similar, I suppose, to the one that he sent on 14 February, which we shall consider in new clause 1. I shall leave Ministers' back-flips until then. It is heartening for Opposition Members to hear from a Minister that the Government are prepared to take account of the clear and specific evidence from people such as Sheriff Gow. As far as I know, he has never been a member of the Labour party or of any organisation except those that are conservative with a small "c". Sheriff Gow made it clear that there would be little point in the Bill if major amendments were not made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I readily concede that my opinions on the matter have changed. It is worthwhile our taking note of the changes made in Committee procedures to set up the Special Standing Committee, which allowed us to hear other people's ideas and views. The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point, but, as I said earlier, every local authority in Scotland is different in terms of size and communities, and there is a danger in making such conditions mandatory. Undoubtedly, Sheriff Gow was right; he was probably a Conservative candidate at a general election at some time in his history.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No wonder he took to the law as a refuge if he stood as a Conservative candidate in Scotland. Some Conservative members of the Committee may be

	<span class='label label-info column'>129</span>
looking for other careers after the next election. We shall look forward to taking evidence from them in the future, when they will support Labour party policy in a Standing Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to refer to people other than Sheriff Gow. The consistent evidence of everyone else was that they were worried that there would be different regimes from board to board. On one side of a county line the regime might be lax, and on the other it might be strict. People from Ary Pavilion said that they suffered from the effects of individuals taking drugs on the premises. They did not condone it, but they wanted uniformity. They were worried that because of what had happened in their area and on their premises, their licensing board would be very hard and restrict their ability to earn a living running dance halls—now called rave halls—as they had done for 20 years. As my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Central, said, they will be called something else in four or five years. We want to have uniformity. Crew 2000 said that there should be a blanket set of minimum restriction with built-in flexibility. That is the aim of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we debate new clause 1, I will express doubts about whether it will be possible to set such restrictions under its provisions. It is the Government's responsibility to set mandatory minimum standards and guidelines throughout Scotland. There is a lot of buck passing. The responsibility is being pushed on to licensing boards, which are reacting as did the board in Glasgow, where people who have been sitting on licensing boards for many years worry that will be said of them if they introduce measures that the local public will view as condoning drug taking. We must tighten up the Bill so that it is sensitive to public opinion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have set out, not to condone drug taking, but to make the lives of people who go to raves a little safer. They do not have to take drugs to use a chill-out area. When they have danced all night, there must be somewhere away from the music where they can relax, or they will be in that frenzy all the time. The area is not for drug taking; it is for the good health of young people. The guidelines should be mandatory. This is a Government responsibility and they are passing the buck by trying to make licensing boards take up the guidelines on the basis of individual choice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely with what the hon. Gentleman said about separate areas, not only on the issue of drug taking, but on noise. I am concerned about the noise levels in some venues. A place where the youngsters can get a break from that noise is a good health facility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point is well made. I suffer slightly from tinnitus because I was into heavy rock music when I was young. I used to study with headphones on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Raymond S. Robertson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That explains it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It did not harm my grades at university, but it certainly harmed my hearing. That is a valid point. I remember going to see the Beatles when they first came

to Glasgow. They had Vox AC 30 amplifiers on stage. If one goes to a concert now, one is bombarded with 1,000 watts. That would damage the hearing of people who went regularly. The issue is not just about drugs; it is about being able to step out of a frenzied environment for a short time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My main point is that the buck passing or forcing licensing boards to make individual decisions can be got over by the Government accepting their responsibilities and making guidelines mandatory throughout Scotland at a minimum standard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment that will be tabled will cover the points made by hon.

I make it clear the precise nature of the power of the consequent statutory instrument will need to be developed and the draft statutory instrument will be subject to consultation. The matter will be taken forward. The amendment was not ready for the Committee because we wanted to be sure that we had got it right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also make the point, as did the hon. Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Ross), that the Special Standing Committee works, but time is needed between the evidence sittings and the rest of the Committee proceedings to reflect on the evidence and the points made by Members before reaching conclusions. It is more important to get the Bill right than to rush it through. I thank the hon. Gentleman for what he said, even if Sheriff Gow was not a Conservative candidate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The spirit of the Government's response to the amendment, in terms of the mandatory element and the uniformity of provisions, has been taken on board. I am delighted by the Minister's comments. As he rightly said, a little time is needed between the evidence sittings and the rest of the proceedings to ensure that the legislation is right. The Minister has been most courteous to me throughout. Only this morning, we had discussions on the provisions that would be before us. I am delighted that the Minister is listening to us and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed, </i>That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may consider Government new clause 1 and Government amendment No. 24.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the Committee's permission, I should like to deal with new clause 1 and amendment No. 24 together. When we committed the Bill to the Special Scottish Standing Committee it was with the intention of ensuring that the proposals were the best way of achieving the policy objective—which I know hon. Members all support— of protecting those who attend certain dance events.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know from personal experience that the Committee tackled its remit vigorously. That is how it should be, and as a result of that thorough review we are now better able
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0725">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>131</span>
to assess, before detailed scrutiny begins, whether the present proposals are indeed the best way of achieving the objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the Special Standing Committee's help, which I readily acknowledge, we have been able to respond to two major concerns: that boards should not be able to elect whether to set conditions and that the use of byelaws to set the conditions is not the best way to proceed. I know from other amendments that were tabled that certain hon. Members also considered that those matters should be dealt with, but I believe that new clause 1 fully addresses those concerns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the new proposals, licensing boards will be obliged to attach conditions to liquor licences for premises that are to be used for the type of events that the Bill addresses. Byelaws will not be required for that purpose, so the flexibility and local discretion that are recognised as being important to the success of our objective are secured. Since the byelaws are no longer required for that purpose, the criminal sanction that a breach of a byelaw would attract is no longer applicable. However, as hon. Members have already made clear, breach of a condition set under the provisions must also be treated seriously. We therefore propose to make it a criminal offence for the conditions to be breached and that the maximum penalty should be level 5 on the standard scale, which is currently £5,000. I realise that that is a higher penalty than is available for a breach of byelaws made under the 1976 Act, but I hope that hon. Members will agree that it is only right to make it clear from the outset that such infringements will be treated seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 1 follows the previous version in setting out the broad characteristics of events to which the new provisions are to apply. I know that some concern has been expressed about that method of describing the relevant types of events, but we are not seeking to define in rigid terms the events to which the Bill will apply. Instead, we are trying to provide a framework within which boards can define more precisely the activity that they intend to control. That enables boards to be flexible and to adapt to their local circumstances which, of course, they can best assess. It also means that boards can cope with the inevitable changes in the modern dance scene.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the interests of fairness, we are providing for a licence holder to be able to appeal to the sheriff against the terms of any condition imposed and against the refusal by a board to consent to an event being held. We are also providing a defence for people charged with an offence under the provisions that they took all reasonable steps to comply with the board's conditions. I hope that hon. Members will agree that those measures maintain the balance of fairness for licence holders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 24 amends the long title of the Bill to reflect the new proposals. The changes that I have described are intended to improve the way in which we deliver on the promise to try to make dance events safer for our young people. I hope that the new proposals allay hon. Members' concerns about how that was to be achieved and that we can agree that what is now proposed presents an acceptable way forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that what we now have meets fully our objective, but, of course, I am always prepared to listen to and consider any other proposals that might contribute to further improving the arrangements. I commend the amendment and the new clause to the Committee.
	<span class='label label-info column'>132</span>
In doing so, it follows that my position will be that the existing clause 1 should not stand part of the Bill. I was therefore somewhat relieved, Mr. Martin, that you did not ask me to move that the clause stand part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his contribution and for tabling the new clause. There is no doubt that there are hugh concessions in new clause 1. As the Minister and others have said, that is because we set up a Special Standing Committee, took evidence and listened. That is manifest in new clause 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The byelaws have gone and I welcome that. Mr. Loudon's evidence to the sitting at Inverness suggested that the byelaws could be cumbersome and bureaucratic and that they might lie on the statute book without revision so that they did not serve the intended purpose. Now, we have flexibility and that is extremely important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has already referred to safety. We have noted a deficiency in the Bill, which included health, but not safety. I am delighted to see that the Minister has taken that on board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also pleased to see local discretion on conditions to be attached in the new section 18A(2) that will be created by new clause 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there are one or two more points that I should like the Minister to consider in the same spirit, and I hope that he might do so before the Report stage. First, I have gone over definition before and shall not do so at length, but I hope that the Minister will look at it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, on proposed section 18A(3)(c), and the phrase,
	<br><blockquote><p>"which it appears to the board",</p></blockquote>
we want to avoid a board's being taken to court and the feeling that inclusion of the word "appears" could lead to judicial review. Both Sheriff Gow and Mr. Loudon mentioned that point. The Minister has been positive on that point, but I should like him to move further before Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, proposed section 18A(4)(b) would
	<br><blockquote><p>"require the holder of the licence to meet such requirements as are specified by such person".</p></blockquote>
Again, we need a definition of "person" and it would help if the Government would provide one in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the terms of establishing conditions, the Minister has been positive and has said that the Government will issue conditions. We look forward to receiving those amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We heard evidence from several organisations which were positive and supportive in what they said. The Scottish Drugs Forum said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The challenge will be to introduce sensible, easily implemented minimum standards which will truly make a difference across Scotland as a whole, whilst allowing the room for the flexible implementation of further desirable measures in accordance with circumstances pertaining at any individual venue or event."</p></blockquote>
Like other hon. Members, I believe that we have gone down that route and have listened to organisations that are in regular contact with young people at these events. That shows the strengths of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The forum added:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Some may see the curtailing of dance events as synonymous with a reduction in drug taking whilst believing the phenomenon of 'recreational' drug use is peculiar to the dance music —scene.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0726">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>133</span>
However, 'recreational' drug use is a 'youth' phenomenon rather than a dance phenomenon and is widespread within other sections of youth culture. If certain youth scenes are singled out as being exclusively associated with drug use, and certain events are prevented from occurring legitimately due to this perceived association, there is a danger that certain parts of youth culture will be driven 'underground' thus making intervention more difficult."</p></blockquote>
That goes to the core of the issue. We are not declaring war on young people over drug taking. We realise what environment young people live in and we want them to enjoy themselves. But we want them to be as safe as possible while they do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps all of us have a little bit of a handicap in understanding the youth culture scene and what it is all about. We have made some progress during the Committee's deliberations, but we should work alongside young people to ensure that the best of youth culture can be maintained and that we can be of assistance to them rather than a hindrance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many reasons for young people taking drugs. One of the books that was issued to the Committee stated that it was simplistic to assume that drug misuse took place because of traffickers and dealers. It is largely due to the influence of friends. Drugs spread among friends in a hospitable way, reflecting wider social changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must understand how and why drugs are used. Many young people feel that using drugs is not harmful— they like the enjoyment and the environment in which it takes place. Peer pressure is very important in the matter, which is why we cannot undertake a war on drugs. We must work alongside young people. The Committee, to the best of its ability, has tried to understand and to implement that, which is why I am pleased that the Minister has tabled the new clause, accepting that things have changed since the Bill was drawn up. The views that have been received from different groups throughout Scotland have been taken into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had hoped that I had made my last contribution to the debate in Committee, but it is appropriate to declare another back-flip.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When it was announced that there was to be a special investigation into the deaths at Hanger 13 I did not think that that was necessary. The facts seemed to be clear and everyone seemed to understand the position. The investigation underlined that the facts were known and that the people understood that, by bringing out the report, Sheriff Gow had put into the world of officialdom the facts as they were. The fact that the Scottish Office was prepared to pick up that matter and run with it justified the special hearing. Perhaps some value has come from the sad loss of life at Hanger 13.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause meets all the aspirations that I have for the Bill. Once again, there has been a mighty contribution from a wide spectrum of people such as senior law officers, the police, council officials and young people who enjoy the dance scene. I link on to much of what the hon. Member for Dumbarton said about allowing youngsters to enjoy their own life style in a safe and proper manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should fight drugs and there should be a war on them, but not a war on individuals. There should be a war of educational aspects and a war on drug pushers. That would be a strong step towards controlling the activities of pushers. I welcome the new clause and the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>134</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I echo what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton, and Opposition Members welcome the comments of the hon. Members for Ayr. However, following the confrontation that unfortunately developed between the Minister and myself in Inverness while he was giving evidence and after seeing the extent of the new clause, I wondered whether we had been drawn into another Conservative party, internal conflict. Has the Minister of State made a bid to wreck the Bill of his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and perhaps go for glory at the same time? I wondered whether the measure would be ruled out, but it has passed the Speaker's scrutiny, and is, therefore, a genuine attempt to legislate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will not be much disagreement about the proposal, but I want to use the clause stand part debate to stress that we believe in Special Standing Committees, which play an important role. I can well remember the Government's opposition to Special Standing Committees on other aspects of Scottish legislation. They might have saved us some of the anxiety and problems that we currently experience. Special Standing Committees involve those outside the House in the widest consultation exercise that is possible, given the somewhat restrictive rules of Special Standing Committee procedure. Such wide consultation ensures that the politicians get it right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Special Standing Committees also provide an opportunity of obtaining the best advice. My hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton rightly paid tribute to some of those who came along and wrote in with advice. Without their advice and warnings, we could have stumbled into another trap in our haste to protect young people, and, as Sheriff Gow said, made the measure useless and unusable. We would have had to reconsider the matter in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a message for the Government in Special Standing Committee procedure and in our proceedings on the Bill. The Government are responsible for attempting to make good law. Yet the measure has been a sorry state of affairs from day one. All but two Opposition members of the Committee have no real knowledge of the law. When we took evidence from the Law Society, it was clear that different members could find themselves in conflict, perhaps even within the same chambers of practice. One lawyer might defend the local authority and the other, the licensee. When the Government get it wrong, they are responsible for correcting their mistakes. That is a major responsibility. It did not do the Special Standing Committee, and especially the Scottish Office, credit when the Minister tried to argue in Inverness that correcting such mistakes was hon. Members' responsibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I try to allow hon. Members some leeway, but we are discussing clause stand part. The clause deals with the enabling powers of the Bill, not Special Standing Committees. Perhaps that subject can be debated at another time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall stop referring to the Special Standing Committee, but in the light of our experience we have an even greater responsibility to ensure that we have got the

	<span class='label label-info column'>135</span>
new clause right. In the first instance, that is the Government's responsibility. The Government should be aware of the lessons that they need to learn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister argued that the time lag between meetings of the Committee was important. It is up to the Government to ensure that there is sufficient time to get the Bill right. A force emanated from the Government to try to have the Bill enacted as quickly as possible. However, it was obvious from the discussions that took place and the major new clause that has been introduced that the Government were pushing too hard. I hope that the Minister can assure us that sufficient account has been taken of all the comments, advice and consultation. Is he confident that the new clause will address those concerns and be good law, so that we do not have to come back at some time to amend the new clause if it is accepted?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Roseanna Cunningham 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Perth and Kinross)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a novice to this procedure, may I say that I was a little surprised to be confronted with an entirely new clause which is effectively a substantive provision? That might be said to show that the procedure works, but perhaps greater pre-legislative consultation might have been more appropriate. I am not sure that being confronted with an entirely new clause at this stage is ideal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, I welcome some of the provisions in the new clause, which provides, among other things, that the licensing board "shall" attach various conditions to the licence. That provision deals with a major loophole. I am also glad that health and safety are bracketed together. It was clear from all the evidence that such an issue had to be taken into consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise for the remarks that I am about to make because, understandably enough, I looked at his with a lawyer's eye. With regard to what was said earlier, I am a cynical enough lawyer to say that laws are generally designed for lawyers to argue about and make a great deal of money from. I am looking at these provisions with the eye of someone who, two years ago, might have been receiving instructions from one side or the other.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Watson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Making a great deal of money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Making a great deal of money whichever the side, which is what happens. In any event, my comments will be made from that point of view, and I hope that the Minister will listen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share some of the concerns expressed by the hon. Member for Dumbarton, particularly with reference to proposed new section 18A(3)(c), which applies to any event
	<br><blockquote><p>"at which it appears to the board that offences may be committed".</p></blockquote>
The provision should be amended and the phrase "reasonable suspicion" used instead. That term is readily understood by lawyers and in court procedure. Using it will give rise to considerably less argument than the provision's current wording, and would make matters much simpler. The interpretation of the current wording will depend on the basis on which matters are considered, and allows for a far wider inclusion. To give an extreme example, in the eyes of some councillors, any event to which 18 to 25-year-olds go could be an event at which it would appear to them
	<span class='label label-info column'>136</span>
that drugs will be used. I am not sure that such an argument is in the spirit of the Bill,so it is best for the Bill to be clearer in its terminology.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, in court proceedings, the expressions in 	<i>Hansard</i> will not be relied upon. It is what is in the Bill that will count. That leads again to the idea of the regional variations. Reasonable suspicion is a more easily understood concept and is less likely to lead to the regional variations that may occur under the present wording.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (4)(b) deals with the delegation to "such person" being unspecified in any way—and a similar problem arises there. As I understand it, COSLA has asked for that, but I nevertheless wonder whether that is the best way of doing it. Regional variation is often to be welcomed, but this may not be one of those times. The Bill cannot be excluded from the wider context in Scotland at present and the Scotland Against Drugs campaign. The matter cannot be taken in isolation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not possible to achieve absolute uniformity as there are bound to be some variations, but if we want to see some kind of consistency throughout Scotland, anything that reduces regional variation would help enormously. Given the views expressed by one particular city council, it is likely that some quite draconian measures will be taken by some authorities. That is not what the Bill is trying to do. It does not aim to take such a draconian attitude, but I fear that that may happen if too much regional variation is allowed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the introduction of the defence of reasonable steps. That is important—it is something that is generally recognised and is only fair. Just as a lawyer, I would have wonderful fun with the definition of "dancing". The present definition could include sitting down and, although it is a bit before my time, perhaps some members of the Committee can remember hand jiving. That would be included in the definition of "dancing".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may be able to assist the hon. Lady.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that because some clarity is needed.

On my way into the House yesterday with my hon. Friend the Member for Maryhill I saw a poster that looked like an official Government poster but was for immigration consultants who claimed to "guarantee every immigration application". It looked as though someone was about to make a massive killing by setting themselves up to pretend to advise people who are troubled and trapped by the new immigration laws. People who see a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0728">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>137</span>
money-making opportunity in badly made laws make a lot of money at the expense of innocent and vulnerable people. In this case, we could end up with licensees having to get help from consultants in rave legislation in order to make decent licence applications. Often, the deviousness of people who look at the law from a money-making point of view is not considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is to be commended—although I should not put it any more strongly than that—for accepting the overwhelming logic of the case that has been put against using byelaws to regulate the licences of potential rave venues or clubs. That is most important. Similarly, the use of the word "shall" in the new clause is important and helpful in reinforcing acceptance of the idea that the Government must do more than extol, the virtues of, and exort people to adopt, a certain way forward; and must, if they are responsible, make the conditions mandatory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point was made strongly by the hon. Member for Perth and Kinross (Ms Cunningham) that we must avoid going over the top. My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Ross) spoke warmly of the Special Standing Committee, and I agree about its importance. In addition to an overwhelming body of opinion from one quarter about how we should proceed, a vast variety of other views have been conveyed. For example, someone from the Calton Athletic Recovery Group—a former class A drug abuser—told us that nothing should be done that would ever let anyone touch any kind of drug, because that might lead from the taking of ecstasy to the use of temazepam and other drugs such as methadone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The written evidence that we received was also important—particularly that sent by the Centre for Drug Misuse Research at the university of Glasgow. I hope that all hon. Members took the trouble to read the five submissions. The one that most interested me was about MDMA.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We cannot go back over the business of the investigation Committee. That is not a matter for us. I like to give hon. Members a little leeway, but the matter before us is clause 1 stand part, and new clause 1.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that guidance. I did not think that I was straying outwith the guidance that was given earlier. It is the evidence that has been brought to Committee that provides the reasons for supporting the new clause. My views about the new section 38A(3)(d) that the original clause 1 would insert into the Licensing (Scotland) Act 1976, with its specification of an event
	<br><blockquote><p>"at which it appears to the board that offences may be committed in relation to controlled drugs within the meaning of section 2 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971",</p></blockquote>
were strongly informed by the evidence that was presented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was very disquieted by the lack of a mandatory element to the making of conditions under the original clause 1. It is clear from the evidence that a pattern of
	<span class='label label-info column'>138</span>
taking amphetamines, nitrates and ecstasy—not chemicals such as the downers, or methadone and others—exists in the rave scene. Drug use in the dance environment is a matter of being intoxicated, rather than of taking drugs that lead to addiction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem arises in the potential for the two phenomena to become linked. People take downers to come off the high that they experience in the dance scene. I hope that the evidence has led us to the conclusion that people in the dance scene take nitrates, amphetamines—known as speed—or ecstasy, but that they would not have to take a drug to chill out. The danger is that they might take something to enable them to come down from the high, such as temazepam. However, in a safe environment, they could chill out without taking a drug. The real danger of taking downers to come off the high was emphasised by a number of people. An alternative would be to provide an atmosphere in which people can chill out. Making that mandatory will be vast progress in our approach to the drugs scene. As Willie McBride of Crew 2000 said, we are not talking about condoning drug use but about living in the world as it is. New clause 1 will make that clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One aspect causes me concern. Sometimes, as happened in Glasgow city, reaction sets in; emotions run high and people's perceptions lead them to decide not to become involved because they do not want to be blamed or take responsibility for something that appears to condone the use of drugs. New clause 1 is not about condoning drug use. I hope that it will be welcomed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new Scotland Against Drugs initiative has meant everyone coming together. However, any policy announced by the Scottish Office and the Government these days is about oneupmanship, about getting the press behind them. I recall my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton suggesting a task force on drugs a few weeks before the Secretary of State did. However, the right hon. Gentleman did not want to be part of anyone else's drug task force; he had to catch the press and launch his own. I worry that the Scottish Office's guidelines and approach will not be presented in an evenhanded way but will try to outstrip the licensing boards by somehow showing the Government as the leader in this fight. There are no leaders, or first and second prizes. When a generation of young people, or even one young person, begins to take drugs in the way that the evidence suggests, we must be concerned about what happens to them. We must get together in line rather than proclaim, as the Government might, "Come and join the Scottish Office's initiative." My worry is that the Bill will allow the Secretary of State to use it to catch the headlines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that he will talk to COSLA, but he must also talk to licensing boards and local authorities. He must reassure us that the Bill will be used in such a way that it will not be a question of the Secretary of State setting targets, or writing guidelines or regulations, and telling local authorities and licensing boards, "We are the leader. You had better catch up with us. We are more interested in drugs, and if you fail to do as we wish, you will be seen as politically not quite as good on the subject."
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0729">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>139</span>
There is no good and no bad, no winner and no loser. If the Government are sensible, and work with licensing boards, the mandatory nature of the guidelines in new clause 1 will be seen as unifying. That will advance the fight against drugs more surely than if the Government try to score points, as they seem to do from time to time—even with drugs, which should never be a political football.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The all-party nature of the approach to drug misuse must continue. We shall stress that at the meeting of the four party leaders whose role in taking that forward will be most important.

We shall certainly examine the points made by the hon. Member for Dumbarton, as well as the point about reasonable suspicion raised by the hon. Member for Perth and Kinross.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, West mentioned the opinion that I gave during the evidence. At the end of the Special Standing Committee, when asked to give my reactions, I gave the reasons for the Bill being so framed. I did not attempt to give a considered reply to each aspect of the evidence because time would have been needed to review and assess it, and to reach conclusions about the best way forward in the light of the evidence. What I said then should not be regarded as a final view of the Bill because I did not intend that. It was an explanation of why the Bill was drafted as it was.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Ayr said that at the beginning of the case he thought that the facts of Hanger 13 were clear. Many facts of which we were unaware emerged during the evidence. I was struck by the use of uppers an downers. I did not know that people went into raves having taken ecstasy before they started to queue and that they came out later to take temazepam or a similar drug to cool them down. Of course, the effects of that can be very dangerous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Member for Falkirk, East that we have to live in the world as it is. Education on drugs will become increasingly important and it has been incorporated into the curriculum as a result of the initiative taken by my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, who has responsibility for education. A number of packages have been prepared to help young people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Falkirk, East asked about consultation with various organisations. We can do that formally through COSLA and informally through Scottish Office officials. In that way, we get the best of both worlds. The hon Gentleman also asked whether there would be uniformity of approach. As in the past, all interests, such as COSLA, the licensing boards and other bodies, will be carefully and fully consulted. I am grateful for the welcome that has been given to the new clause. We must make certain that it works well and thoroughly throughout Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>LICENSING CONDITIONS FOR CERTAIN EVENTS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>'.—(1) In the Licensing (Scotland) Act 1976 (in this Act referred to as "the 1976 Act"), after section 18 (giving reasons for decision of licensing board) there shall be inserted the following section—</p>
	<p>	<i>"Licensing conditions for certain events."</i></p>
	<p>18A.—(1) In granting—
	<ol>
	<li>a licence under section 17 of this Act;</li>
	<li>an occasional licence under section 33 of this Act; or</li>
	<li>an occasional permission under section 34 of this Act,</li></ol>
in respect of premises on or a place at which it appears to the licensing board that any event to which this section applies may be held, the licensing board shall attach to the licence or permission conditions for the purpose of safeguarding the health and safety of persons attending any such event.</p>
	<p>(2) The duty of a licensing board under subsection (1) above to attach conditions to a licence or permission is without prejudice to any power of the board under this Act to attach or impose conditions to or in respect of a licence or permission.</p>
	<p>(3) This section applies to any event—
	<ol>
	<li>at which music is played or relayed;</li>
	<li>which consists of or includes the opportunity for persons attending the event to engage in dancing and</li>
	<li>at which it appears to the board that offences may be committed in relation to controlled drugs within the meaning of section 2 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.</li></ol></p>
	<p>(4) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1) above, the conditions may—
	<ol>
	<li>provide that no event to which this section applies, or no such description of such events as may determined by the board, shall be held without the consent of the board; and</li>
	<li>require the holder of the licence to meet such requirements as are specified by such person as may be determined by the board.</li></ol></p>
	<p>(5) The holder of a licence may appeal to the sheriff against—
	<ol>
	<li>the terms of any condition imposed under subsection (1) above; and</li>
	<li>the refusal of consent under subsection (4)(a) above.</li></ol></p>
	<p>(6) The holder of a licence or his employee or agent shall be guilty of an offence if he contravenes any condition attached to the licence or permission under subsection (1) above.</p>
	<p>(7) It shall be a defence for a person charged with an offence under subsection (6) above to prove that he took all reasonable steps to comply with the condition.</p>
	<p>(8) In this section—
	<br><blockquote><p>"holder of licence" includes a person to whom an occasional permission has been granted under section 34 of this Act;</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"dancing" includes any movement apparently to the accompaniment of music; and</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"music" includes sounds wholly or predominantly characterised by the emission of a succession of repetitive beats.</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>(9) In the application of section 67(1)(a) and (c) and (2) to an offence under subsection (6) above, "licence-holder" includes a person to whom an occasional permission has been granted."</p>
	<p>(2) In section 31 of the 1976 Act—
	<ol>
	<li>in subsection (2), at the end insert—</li>
	<div class='ul'>
	<li>"(c) that there has been a breach of the conditions attached to the licence under section 18A(1) of this Act.";</li></div> <!-- ul -->
	<li>in subsection (3)(a) after the word "thereunder" there shall be inserted the words "or of any condition attached to a licence under the said section 18A(1)".</li></ol></p>

	<p>	<i>Brought up, read the First and Second time, and added to the Bill.</i></p>

	<div class='title'>Title</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Amendment made: </i>No. 24, in line 1, leave out from 'to' to 'conditions' in line 2 and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'require licensing boards to attach to licences'.—	<i>[Lord James Douglas-Hamilton.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Even though some members of the Committee are anxious to leave quickly, I must give notice that I shall seek to table an amendment on Report to ensure that the new conditions can apply to licences as the need arises. At present, the board can apply conditions only when considering an application for the granting of a new licence or the renewal of an existing one. Licences are renewed every three years or so. Therefore, it could take some time before all licences are dealt with appropriately, so we shall table a tidying-up amendment to make provision for variations in current licences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank you very much, Mr. Martin, for chairing the Committee so successfully. I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Dumbarton for the constructive way in which he has argued many important points. There has been an all-party campaign against drug abuse, which is a major problem that we must tackle. Although the Bill may be only a small part of an eventual solution, it gives the important signal that we shall take whatever steps are necessary in the fight against drug abuse and misuse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank members of the Committee for their help and also 	<i>Hansard, </i>the civil servants and everyone else who has attended our proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I thank the Minister for his co-operation. I also thank those who gave evidence. It was extremely worthwhile both from an educational and from a legislative point of view and people will feel that they have been listened to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last time that the Minister and I served on a Bill I presented him with a book called "Eve was Framed", by Helena Kennedy. The Minister sent a civil servant to
	<span class='label label-info column'>142</span>
the top of Whitehall to buy a copy. I now ask him to accompany me and other colleagues to the film "Trainspotting" which is to be released in the next few weeks. Many comments have been made about the film and it has been said that it glamorises drugs, but in a newspaper report yesterday, Detective Superintendent Kevin Orr, the drugs officer for Strathclyde police, who took part in Operation Eagle, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"'Trainspotting' is the most accurate depiction of the life of heroin addicts I have ever come across."</p></blockquote>
As someone of that calibre has made such a comment, in the humble spirit of educating myself further I shall go to see the film. We could all do ourselves a favour by seeing the film and the Minister would enhance his status even further if for a second time he took up my suggestion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. If the Minister reads my contribution in our Glasgow sitting he will find that I referred him to the book "Trainspotting". I have not seen the film, but the book is a great experience and shows what drug users in Edinburgh and those associated with them go through on a daily basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have never known a Committee to be used to advertise films and books. There is always something new.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the Minister and hon. Members for their kind remarks. It is a sad day when we have to introduce such legislation and it is even sadder mat almost all our constituencies have been touched by the death of young people. A young constituent of mine died in Hanger 13. It is not pleasant when a mother rings to ask one to contact the procurator fiscal to have her son's body released so that there can be a decent and dignified funeral.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are the changes that are taking place in our society. I hope and pray that one day we shall not need such legislation, but it is necessary now and we have to fight the people responsible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the Clerks—the apprentice Clerk, Ms McGlashan and Mr. Evans, who has helped me immensely on many Bills. I thank the Serjeant at Arms and the police officers who have looked after us—and, of course, our old friends from 	<i>Hansard, </i>who do an excellent job. I also thank the members of the Committee, the public who came to hear our case, and the press.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
