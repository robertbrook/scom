	<div class='title'>Letter from the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>I refer to your letter dated 19 December, 1995, in connection with the above subject and enclose for your information a copy of our response on the consultation document which has been forwarded to the Scottish Office Home and Health Department.</p>
	<p>I understand that the Association may be called to give evidence to the Special Standing Committee and I should be grateful if you could confirm at the earliest opportunity whether this will be the case.</p>
	<p>	<b>Annexe to Letter from the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland:</b></p>
	<p>	<b>Letter to Scottish Office Home and Health Department</b></p>
	<p>	<i>Licensing (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill</i></p>
	<p>I refer to your letter dated 5th December, 1995, in connection with the above subject and would advise that this matter has now been considered by our General Purposes Standing Committee.</p>
	<p>The Association notes that this matter will be considered by a Special Standing Committee and we have already received correspondence in this connection from the Clerk to the Scottish Affairs Committee. In the meantime we would wish to make the following comments on the Bill.</p>
	<p>While we recognise that the Bill is an attempt to safeguard the health of those persons attending "raves" in licensed premises by allowing Boards to impose conditions relating to such matters as the availability of water "cooling off areas and medical facilities, we foresee problems arising over the definition of what is or is not a "rave". Moreover, the Bill does not cover events held outwith licensed premises and so-called "underground raves" cannot therefore be controlled. Many of these are regulated by the issue of a Public Entertainments Licence granted under Section 41 of the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982, and while the Bill proposes to amend the Licensing (Scotland) Act 1976, perhaps the 1982 Act should also be amended which would allow Licensing Committees to impose similar conditions.</p>
	<p>The proposals enable Licensing Boards to exercise greater control over the holding of raves, and this appears to be a generally good idea but we are concerned that the proposals might suggest to some that the taking of drugs at such events is considered acceptable provided certain precautions are in place. It may create difficulties for the
	<span class='label label-info column'>90</span>
police should objections or observations be raised in relation to the grant or renewal of a licence when the very wording of the Bill seems to almost expect Licensing Boards to acknowledge the commission of drugs offences at these events.</p>
	<p>Finally, it was felt that the second part of the Bill, which relates to the composition of Licensing Boards, has no particular implications for the police.</p>
	<p>Mr. Finlay Maclennan, Deputy Chief Constable, Northern Constabulary; and Mr. Thomas Wood, Assistant Chief Constable, Lothian and Borders Police, 	<i>called in and examined.</i></p>
	<p>2.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On behalf of the Special Standing Committee, I welcome the witnesses to this session. I ask them to introduce themselves for the sake of the record. I shall then take the first question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Finlay MacIennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am Finlay Maclennan, Deputy Chief Constable, Northern Constabulary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas Wood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am Tom Wood, Assistant Chief Constable, Lothian and Borders Police, in charge of operations. During the past five years, I have had operational responsibility for the policing of 60 raves licensed under the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the police a question? The rave scene in Scotland does not seem to have developed to the same degree as it has south of the border. Consequently, it does not appear to present the same sort of problems to the police in Scotland. Is that a fair assessment? Can the witnesses put into context the scale of the drug problem at raves and tell us what sorts of drugs are most commonly used? Is there any evidence to show that the scale of the drugs problem at raves differs significantly from one part of Scotland to another, region by region?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Finlay MacIennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that it is quite right that it has not developed in Scotland to the same degree as it has in England and Wales; but, having said that, the problem has been with us now for a number of years. There have been developments in Scotland where, at one time, raves were held in big buildings outside. Now, they are moving indoors. In policing terms, the main problem with raves has been the connection with drugs. On the question of the type of drugs, we are in a moving scene in drugs culture. At one time, the type of drugs used at festivals and rock concerts were cannabis or cannabis related. That is not the case now. At raves, there are likely to be amphetamines, LSD and ecstasy, which are produced in drug factories and are becoming prevalent, some with dramatic consequences. We are not saying that everyone who goes to a rave partakes of drugs—far from it—but drugs have been our main problem. The same problems tend to be present throughout Scotland, but numbers determine the scale.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas Wood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is our perception that one of the differences between the Scottish and English approaches is that, from the beginning, many Scottish
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0702">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>91</span>
local authorities licensed these events under the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982. There was not the same push to drive these events underground—it is the illegal or underground events that have caused the English service so much difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the second point, there is no doubt that the use of ecstasy and amphetamines is closely intertwined with the rave scene, but—to emphasise Mr. Maclennan's point— last year about 30,000 people attended licensed raves in my force area and of those 30,000, 200 were arrested or reported for possession of drugs. It is sometimes easy to assume—especially after seeing media reports—that everybody who attends these events uses drugs. That is by no means true.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no further questions. Thank you very much, Mr. Wood.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Roseanna Cunningham 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Perth and Kinross)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are the police in a position to say what they would define as a rave in relation to the operation of the Bill? There have been some questions about how to define such an event. Have the police any estimates of how many underground raves are taking place in comparison with raves in licensed premises? I realise that you will not have any definite figures, but do you have some idea of the proportions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Finlay MacIennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The definition of a rave was a point raised by the Association of Police Officers in Scotland. We passed comment on it in our submission to the Committee. The association felt that the definition was so loose that it would include other types of event in licensed premises, such as discos an so on. Having said that, the association is also conscious that raves cannot be defined too rigidly or too narrowly because of the changing scene in respect of music events—be it the rock concerts and festivals of the past or the raves of today— and their link with the drug scene.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the definition of raves to include something like what we have in the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994. That definition takes on board 100 or more people attending and specifies the night time in relation to raves. That, to a degree, narrows the definition of what a rave might be. The other point that I would make in that respect is that I can foresee that as they evolve in years to come, we may well have these types of events not emphasising dancing as much as they do now, so there may be room for leaving dancing out of the definition to take on board what the future might hold for us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas Wood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I deal with the question of how many underground or illegal raves have taken place? As you said, it is difficult for me to be precise, but from my calculations of events in my area only about half a dozen attempts have been made over the past five years to hold underground or illegal raves. I think that that is a fairly accurate estimate, because we hear about them either before or after they occur. It is very seldom that we hear nothing at all about very large groups of people coming together for that reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>92</span>
One of the reasons why there are so few is that there are properly structured and licensed raves. One reason why there might be an increase would be if the demand was unsatisfied. As long as we have the licensed and structured events, I think that there will be no demand for, and therefore very few, underground events.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McFall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to press Mr. Wood on the issue of underground raves. A few years ago in Gartocharn in my constituency, a farmer let a field to individuals to hold a rave. That evening, I went with the police to see what was happening, but there was very little they could do. Indeed, we were standing in a muddy lane at midnight when a Ford Escort came up at about 40 or 50 mph, bashed past us and ended up at the tent. When we got there, all the doors were open—and we knew the purpose of that. In terms of us framing legislation, is there a deficiency in the Bill for dealing with such an example and for dealing with underground raves generally? Is there a way that we can address that deficiency?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas Wood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The scenario you describe is the nightmare scenario and one in which many English forces found themselves. It is very difficult to deal with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 makes provision to deal with such the situation when people hold an event that is not licensed by the local authority. However, having the legal framework and the practical ability to deal with it is a different matter. Many colleagues in the south, with only limited resources, had to deal with 2,000 or 3,000 people in an open field. That is awkward. As far as I know, the 1982 Act makes ample provision to deal with unlicensed events, but I sympathise with your situation in that muddy lane—it is one thing to have the authority, but another to have the practical ability to deal with something in an uncontrolled situation. However, that is more reason why there should be a properly structured system of allowing licensed events, so that there is no impetus and no demand for the kind of event that you describe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The definition of "rave" interests me. I do not agree with the definition already given. Long-term dancing and continuous heavy-beat dancing are two terms that could be used in defining a rave. It seems to me that the current definition leaves a lot to be desired. Aside from that, as far as the drug scene goes, is not it the case that discos and dance halls across the land have a drugs problem? It is not just connected with the rave scene, however it is defined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas Wood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is absolutely right. Few pubs and clubs do not have some amount of soft drugs available, either amphetamines or ecstasy. The spotlight has been shone on raves because they are bigger and therefore draw more attention. You are right in thinking that there is a proliferation of soft drugs at many places of public entertainment, whether raves or not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What do you feel about chapter 5 of the "Guidelines for Good Practice at Dance Events"? It urges:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Everyone entering the event… should be subject to a search of outer clothing, pockets and bags, to be carried out by a security officer of the same sex."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0703">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>93</span>
If events that are not raves also have a proportion of people taking drugs, how far is that guideline implemented?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Finlay MacIennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think possibly a number of conditions could be attached to the Licensing (Scotland) Act 1976, and that is probably one of them. However, it would not have to be enforced fully in each location. I feel—and the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland agrees—that by giving recognition in an Act of Parliament, credibility may be given to raves, to which the organisers and promoters who are responsible may respond. We feel quite strongly that there are a number of conditions, not just searching people going into a premises. Of course, searching ladies would require additional accommodation so that it could be done in private, although I am not saying that men should not have such a room.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many ways, the purpose of the legislation is not only to look after those who have fallen ill and need medical attention but to do everything possible to make drugs unacceptable at raves. If there is strict control by stewards and promoters—using closed circuit television, for instance—it might encourage people to say, "It is not worth the risk within the premises". As such, it might reduce the number of people on the premises who are involved in drugs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>3 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would that require an equal level of enforcement at all raves? If not, young people might stay away from those raves that were regarded as more restrictive. They might not be using drugs; they might feel that there was an easier atmosphere at the raves that implemented the requirements less rigorously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Finlay MacIennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that would become known. I should hope that close liaison between all those concerned—licensing boards, promoters, organisers and stewards of security companies—might produce a fairly uniform system of enforcement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Within the premises, one would have to try to get those who were actively engaged to try to identify drug pushers and those who go around doing the selling. If we work with the same objectives and aims, the climate might be good for our main purpose. Promoters have a lucrative business, but in order to gain credibility and to be comfortable in relation to the 1976 Act they must be involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Irene Adams 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Paisley, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to press a little on stewarding. We have seen stewards with no qualifications working at raves and similar events. Apparently, anyone with any background can be a steward or a bouncer at a rave or disco—one does not need any medical qualifications, or first-aid experience. How could the police help promoters? How should stewarding of the events be operated? Would the police be prepared to police the stewards? Would it be possible for the police to vet the people doing the stewarding? Could stewards be given a licence by the police? What should the Bill include to help resolve that problem?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas Wood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In fact, in many areas—including my own—local authorities already insist on the use of certain accredited stewarding companies under the Civic
	<span class='label label-info column'>94</span>
Government (Scotland) Act 1982. Those companies have much experience, are well known, and their stewards receive police training and operate under the umbrella of a police commander. That is a matter that might be included in enhanced guidelines as good practice. It is absolutely vital that it succeeds. In the business of running raves, there is always the danger of a cowboy operator or of a stewarding company hoping to make a quick killing. That has to be legislated for or included in guidelines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not get an opportunity to respond to the earlier point about searching for drugs at the door of a rave. Nothing will prevent someone slipping a tablet into his mouth as he enters a premises. However, the advice and guidance about searching people at the door prevents people from carrying significant quantities of illegal substances into dance halls or raves to sell. That is why the guideline is significant, important and worthy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Davidson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Govan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I seek clarification on two points. First, with regard to definition, do you feel that the current definition of raves is too narrow and that a new definition should be included? The more the definition is expanded, the more likely it is to include almost anything, from a ceilidh to a riot. I am not sure what your intention would be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I want to ask about police powers and the weight that would be given to the opinion of the police in circumstances where you felt that an event might be so badly run that it should be stopped. Under existing legislation and this Bill, do you believe that sufficient weight would be given to your view in such circumstances?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Finlay MacIennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To take the second point first—yes, if we have the full weight of the Licensing (Scotland) Act 1976—which has stood the passage of time in relation to events at licensed premises—and of the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982—which gives us the power of entry—behind us. There are penalties if the police are not allowed to enter, so the supervision of events on the premises comes within the ambit of both Acts. What happens if a rave gets of out hand? That is a public order situation, but it is not easy. If there are hundreds or thousands of people out of control—the sort of situation that we have at a football match or a riot in the street—the public order legislation is strong enough to deal with it because the people are in a public place. Our belief is that the definition of a rave is not constant. As I said earlier, it may have been the folk festival or the pop concert of the past. But music has changed and the drug culture has changed. We want to see the definition widened to include 100 or more people attending as well as the night factor under the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act. We do not want the definition to become obsolete. With the passage of time, we do not want the definition to become so narrow that the law cannot be implemented or enforced. I fully believe that everyone involved—the police and the procurators fiscal—would work in the spirit of what is determined to be a rave at the time and not abuse any legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>95</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At Hanger 13, the management arranged their own stewards. They did seek advice from the police about the integrity of individuals, but that gave the police a problem. Have you any suggestions about how to get around that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point relates to the suggestion that split rooms for searching should be a feature. That was not the case at Hanger 13, although very thorough searches of individuals were carried out as they entered. Male and female stewards looked after that. Would you comment on that point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas Wood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Adequate searching facilities are just one of the necessary requirements. There are many commonsense guidelines, learned from long experience, which would make good provisions to be laid down by a licensing authority. Adequate search guidelines are one such provision. As for a stewarding company being an clement of the organisers, that will always be a problem. We have taken the view that, instead of trying to accredit individual members of a stewarding company, which is legally very difficult for us to do, we would much rather accredit an organisation—an accredited, reliable, professional stewarding company that we know. We have tried—and local authorities supported us—to steer away from organisers providing their own stewards because that is always a compromise. We have always tried to insist that there should be an independent stewarding company of good repute with the necessary training.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike Watson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to ask Mr. Wood or Mr. Maclennan to develop the point that is made in the last paragraph on the first page of their submission. It echoes something that was said by the Calton Athletic Recovery Group in its evidence last week—that the Bill in its current form condones the use of drugs. You say much the same in that paragraph. Do you have an answer to the problems that you identify in the last sentence, in which you state:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It may create difficulties for the police should objections or observations be raised in relation to the grant or renewal of a licence"?</p></blockquote>
Can you suggest any way in which the Bill could be amended to remove any such problems or difficulties?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the more minor point of stewarding, what is the possibility of undercover or plain-clothes police having a useful role to play at larger rave events—that is, not club events?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Finlay MacIennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was mentioned in our submission. I do not think that the word was as strong as "condone", but certainly that may have given recognition to the use of drugs on the premises. I hope that people who organise raves, meetings or whatever they may be, will show on notices, screens or CCTV that the use of drugs is prohibited on the premises. That would lessen to a degree the points that were made in our submission. Having said that, I know that ACPOS was conscious of the fact that if someone falls ill on the premises, irrespective of what the cause may be, the most important issue is to get medical attention to that person at a very early stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another point was the difficulty that the police may have in relation to an objection to a licence at a later stage. It is a point to mention, but is weakened by the action that
	<span class='label label-info column'>96</span>
the promoters and organisers themselves take in relation to the use of drugs and the peddling of drugs on the premises. ACPOS did not feel strongly on that issue, but it felt that it should make the point. Having said that, it came across strongly in discussion that if people, wherever they may be, need medical attention, they must get it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas Wood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I take up the point about uniformed as opposed to plain-clothes policing? I feel that at large events there should be a structured police operation involving uniformed and plain clothes officers under one command, who also has within reach a supervisor of stewards and a representative of the organisers. At the events that we have been involved in we have organised a joint control room where all those elements are together under the command of the senior police officer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eastwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The main provisions of the Bill apply only if the licensing board decides to make byelaws. There is no obligation on a licensing board to make such byelaws. That is a point that has been criticised by some of those who have given evidence to us. Is that a point on which the police have a view?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Finlay MacIennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Throughout Scotland diverse views may be taken by licensing boards. It may be a frequent event in Lothian, the borders and Edinburgh, but not so frequent in Fort William or Orkney. For that reason, possibly, licensing boards may not be so an fait with what may be required in certain places as in others. ACPOS would like to see—whether as compulsion or guidance—a strong message going to licensing boards to enforce conditions, because the strength of legislation is not in primary legislation but in the conditions that can be imposed under primary legislation. We certainly believe that there may be room for some guidance to be given to licensing boards in that connection, because if they do not frequently deal with such matters they may not know what they are letting themselves in for and perhaps not quite sure what conditions they could impose and how strong and prohibitive they could be. I should add that I would not want them to be too restrictive, because that would create the danger that raves would go underground. A balanced measure could come before the licensing board and be agreed quite confidently.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>3.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some of our previous witnesses said that certain things could be done differently and that the Bill did not add much to measures already on the statute book—for example, a combination of the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 and the Licensing (Scotland) Act 1976. In particular, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities said that procedures under the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982—which applies to premises that are not licensed for liquor—should apply to liquor-licensed premises. Would you comment on that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas Wood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is our view that the Bill stops a significant loophole. There have been raves in licensed premises where the licensing authorities did not have the mechanism to take the sort of measures that we think are necessary and which have been shown to be so effective

	<span class='label label-info column'>97</span>
under the 1982 Act. Notwithstanding those criticisms, the Bill has a significant use and purpose as it addresses serious and developing problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, gentlemen. We shall scrutinise your evidence.

	<p>	<b>Memorandum by the Law Society of Scotland</b></p>
	<p>The Licensing Law Working Party and the Criminal Law Committee of the Law Society of Scotland have considered the Licensing (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill. The Society has accordingly the following comments to make:</p>
	<p>	<b>General Comments</b></p>
	<p>The Society is pleased that the important stages of this bill will be taken in Scotland. It is particularly noted that the Bill will be reviewed by a Special Standing Committee which will take evidence from those with an interest in the measure. This procedure was employed in relation to the Children (Scotland) Bill and ensures that Members of Parliament are fully acquainted with all the issues arising from the measure. The Society contributed to that exercise and is of the view that that procedure enhanced Parliament's consideration of the Bill. It is hoped that a similar result will ensue from the procedure adopted for the Licensing (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill.</p>
	<p>	<b>Specific Comments</b></p>
	<p>	<i>Clause 1 (Licensing Conditions for Raves</i>)</p>
	<p>The Society commends the proposal that licensing boards should be under a duty in making byelaws to have regard to the need to safeguard the health of persons attending raves.</p>
	<p>The Society nevertheless considers that there are a number of difficulties which could preclude the effective operation of the measure. These are:</p>
	<p>1.	<ol>
	<li>The provisions of new section 38A(1) apply only if a licensing board decides to make byelaws. No duty is imposed on boards to make byelaws and accordingly, if a board does not opt to make such measures, the provision will have no effect. At present there are 56 licensing boards in Scotland of which 43 have issued byelaws of any description.</li>
	<li>The Society is of the view that the provisions of new section 38A(2) could be improved so that those who misuse drugs at raves could be better protected from the effects of drug abuse. However, the clause does not provide that other measures can be taken to prevent or restrain the misuse of drugs at raves.</li>
	<div class='ul'>
	<li>The Society is of the view that licensing boards should have a duty to impose conditions to discourage the misuse of drugs at raves. In particular there should be more policing at such events, adequate provision of properly trained and regulated stewards, control of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>98</span>
numbers of persons attending such events, and provision for raves to be recorded by closed circuit TV.</li></div> <!-- ul -->
	<li>The Society considers that the provisions of new section 38A(3) are vague and open to a number of interpretations.</li></ol></p>
	<p>The word "event" is not defined and could be interpreted as relating to events not currently recognised as raves—e.g. discos or other types of dances. The Society is of the view that the Bill should be amended to apply specifically to "raves". The Society has framed amendments to ensure that raves are defined as "raves or other gatherings" which
	<ol>
	<li>are held in licensed premises;</li>
	<li>at which amplified music is played at night;</li>
	<li>where 100 persons or more attend; and</li>
	<li>where a licensing board has "reasonable suspicion" that offences against the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 may take place.</li></ol>
This definition of "rave" bears some relationship to that contained in the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 particularly in respect of the qualification that a certain number of persons must attend and that the rave involves playing amplified music at night.</p>
	<p>The Society's amendments delete any reference in the Bill to "dancing" so ensuring that "concert type" raves as well as "house-parties" are brought into the scope of the measures such a definition obviates the difficult issue of interpretation of the Bill.</p>
	<p>(d) The society also considers that the provisions of 38A(3)(d) could result in the unreasonable exercise of discretion by boards which could provoke an increased number of actions for judicial review. The Society's amendments seek to require "reasonable suspicion" that offences could take place rather than mere appearance.</p>
	<p>2. The Society is of the view that the provisions of the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 relating to public entertainment licences could produce a more effective result within the context of existing legislation. In particular, it could be provided that obtaining a public entertainment licence should be a condition for the grant of an occasional licence or occasional extension for a rave. This would enable the local authorities to employ the provisions of the 1982 Act. The Society has not presented an amendment in these terms but makes the suggestion for the consideration of the Committee.</p>
	<p>3. The Society is also of the view that it would be useful for the Secretary of State for Scotland to issue guidance as to the types of events which he would expect to be covered by these provisions and the types of conditions which he would expect licensing boards to impose for the purpose of safeguarding the health and safety of persons attending raves.</p>
	<p>4. The Society considers that licensing boards should be permitted to raise complaints under section 31 of the Licensing (Scotland) Act 1976 	<i>ex proprio motu</i> and that the appropriate amendment should be made to section 16(1) of the Act. At present the following persons or bodies can complain to licensing boards;
5 SC63-PAG1/5
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0706">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>99</span>
	<ol>
	<li>owner/occupiers in the neighbourhood;</li>
	<li>Community Councils;</li>
	<li>Churches;</li>
	<li>Chief Constables;</li>
	<li>Fire Authorities; and</li>
	<li>Local Authorities.</li></ol></p>
	<p>Licensing boards are not empowered to make complaints under Section 31. The Society is of the view that licensing boards are well placed to make such complaints and that they should be allowed so to do.</p>
	<p>	<i>Clauses 2 (Composition of licensing divisions) and 3 (Short title, commencement and extent</i>)</p>
	<p>The Society has no comments to make on these clauses.</p>
	<p>Mr. John A. Loudon, Solicitor to the Supreme Court; and Mr. Michael P. Clancy, Deputy Secretary, Law Society, 	<i>called in and examined.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Good afternoon, gentlemen. On behalf of the Special Standing Committee I welcome you to this session of evidence-taking. Would you please identify yourselves for the record?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John A. Loudon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am John Loudon. I am a member of the council of the Law Society of Scotland and convenor of the working party on liquor licensing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael P. Clancy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am Michael Clancy, Deputy Secretary of the Law Society.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do you think that a mandatory requirement should be written into legislation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John A. Loudon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A mandatory requirement to make byelaws? I think that to achieve consistency that would have to be written into the legislation. As the Bill is drafted, only if a licensing board is making byelaws does it have such a duty. I think that out of 56 licensing authorities, only 43 at present have byelaws.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How could the definition of "event" be improved in the Bill? It would be helpful if you could comment on the implications of your suggestion to create what would be effectively a dual licence requirement, tying the public entertainment licence provisions to the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John A. Loudon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At present "event" is not defined in the Bill and neither is "rave", although "rave" is defined elsewhere. We are anxious about what "event" will mean and we suggested that it should be something that is carried on in licensed premises where there is amplified music in the eventing—although I understand that some raves take place during the day—and that the number of people present should be specified, perhaps in excess of 100. We are concerned that the Bill as drafted uses the word "appear" and we believe that a better expression would be "reasonable suspicion". Otherwise we feel that the definition in the draft Bill will be too wide and could easily catch or encompass almost every type of function that is carried on, for instance, in any Scottish hotel: 21st birthday parties, office parties and so
	<span class='label label-info column'>100</span>
on. If a licensing board makes general byelaws, we can easily see that it would sweep in far more than had originally been envisaged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Previously I asked the Association of Chief Police Officers about what it saw as the benefit of the Bill and what dimension was added. Given the remarks of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities about the combination of the Civic Government (Scotland) Act and the Licensing (Scotland) Act, what are your views on that matter? Secondly, how do you interpret the new section 38A(4)(c)?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John A. Loudon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with the second part of your question first. Section 38A(4)(c) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"may include conditions requiring the licence holder to meet such requirements as are specified by such person as may be determined by the board".</p></blockquote>
Because "such person" is not defined in the Bill it seemed to us that if a board were making conditions it should be up to it how it does that and from whom it gets its information. The licence holder should really have nothing to do with that. If one went to an appeal one would be appealing against the decision of the board. I do not suppose that one would want to take advice from the chief constable or the fire master or environmental health officers and involve them in the appeal. One would simply want to deal with the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"as are specified by such person".</p></blockquote>
are unnecessary because if the board has the discretion and the right to include conditions it will be up to it to decide what it wants to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill deals with licensed premises whereas, as the police pointed out, the Civil Government (Scotland) Act 1982, works extremely well for events which take place outwith licensed premises. If one could use the existing legislation to bring into the Bill a reference to what is in the Civic Government (Scotland) Act, one would already have invented the wheel. The law is there. It works in practice and is generally accepted by folk in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael P. Clancy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Picking up on Lord James's question and that of Mr. McFall, a number of local authorities already impose conditions that are similar to those we are talking about such as free drinking water, a limit on numbers of people, the provision of paramedics and so on. We have seen a number of instances in Kyle and Carrick, Stirling and West Lothian where these types of conditions are already imposed. There may be an element of duplication in terms of providing under the licensing legislation as opposed the to Civic Government (Scotland) Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the description of "event" there is also the potential for a conflict between the provisions in the Bill, if it is enacted, and the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994. The question of raves in the open air has already been dealt with in that Act and produced quite a different set of criteria.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Clancy mentioned Kyle and Carrick. One of the difficulties there was prescribing numbers for a particular hall. That came as a great surprise to many of us, bearing in mind fire regulations and so on. Does the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0707">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>101</span>
law Society see any provision within existing law under which Kyle and Carrick could have prescribed numbers If not, should there be something in these guidelines?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John A. Loudon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It depends whether it is licensed or unlicensed premises. If it were licensed premises and an occasional or regular extension were being sought, there is provision in the Licensing (Scotland) Act 1976 for the board to add conditions to the grant of occasional or regular extension. The flexibility is already there, but only in the case of occasional or regular extension. If the premises are unlicensed, the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 applies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As you said some minutes ago, some raves take place during the day. Would you then want to delete in paragraph (b) of your submission the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"at which amplified music is played at night".</p></blockquote>
or would you want it to read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"at which amplified music is played"?</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John A. Loudon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think, being logical, we should delete the words "at night".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael P. Clancy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall explain the rationale behind the proposal that the words should be:
	<br><blockquote><p>"at which amplified music is played at night".</p></blockquote>
It is to bring the legislation into line with section 63 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994. Consistency in the law is a value that we should pursue. To create logical but inconsistent provisions would create difficulty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of your coming to give evidence was to help those of us who know little about the law to try to make good laws. Given that some of your members will have to defend both the possible licence-seekers and the licensing board, does it appear to you that the Bill will end up being good or bad law?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John A. Loudon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a little concerned that some of the proposed procedures will be unnecessarily cumbersome, particularly that of getting boards to introduce byelaws. The making of byelaws is not easy. They must be published and then there is a long period before they are approved by the Secretary of State. If licensing boards want to change byelaws, they must go through a similar procedure, so there is not a great deal of flexibility. We thought that if one were able to impose conditions, as one can on occasional and regular extensions that would give licensing boards a great deal of flexibility in what they do. It would allow them to move with the times and meet particular requirements. It is accepted that raves are fashionable now, but what will be fashionable next year? It is important that whatever system we end up with will move with the times.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the representatives of the Law Society to elaborate on their suggestion that the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 should have been the vehicle for this legislation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>102</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John A. Loudon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Section 41 of the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 sets out all the rules that we would look at in relation to this legislation. All we would have to do is tweak—if that is the right word— section 41(2)(f), which excludes licensed premises. We already know that the people running raves and parties with licensed premises must get permission under the Civic Government (Scotland) Act. We know that licensing boards impose conditions and that in practice that generally works. Building that legislation into the Bill would find favour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Watson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to return to paragraph 1 (c) of your submission, where you refer to the various conditions of licensed premises and music at night. It seems to me that most of the evidence that we have taken and most of the questioning in which we have indulged— I know that Mr. Clancy has been present at the other sittings and has heard it all—has been about whether the Bill is drafted too widely. However, your suggestions seem to be taking it considerably wider. The famous example, which has been mentioned by various hon. Members, of the White Heather club could easily fit in with those conditions. Is it not more important to say that the Bill should deal with the sort of events that we know as rave events? However, club dancing involves similar problems with drugs. However, if the measure were drawn so wide that it implicitly referred to dancing, it would apply to pop concerts, which in my experience and from what I have seen on television, involve dancing. Will you explain why you want the measure to be drawn so wide? Such an approach seems to be at odds with the other evidence that we have heard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>3.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael P. Clancy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take your point, Mr. Watson, about widening the provision. However, our proposals are designed to narrow, and not broaden, the definition of an event. We want to include a number qualification so that we can tie the measure in with current regulations on raves in the open air. We also want to introduce the concept of reasonable suspicion in respect of offences committed under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although we wish to narrow, and not widen, the definition, the concept of widening must be borne in mind. When we discuss new section 38A (3)(d) on what constitute offences under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, it may become apparent that that is where the provisions need tightening. Section 8 of the 1971 Act could be modified, and we could usefully consider doing that, especially for the preparation and use of certain drugs on licensed premises.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Watson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept much of what Mr. Clancy said. In my earlier remarks, I was not referring to the phrase "reasonable suspicion", which is helpful. The use of the phrase "reasonable suspicion" in new section 38A (3)(d) would be a useful addition to the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Gentlemen, your submissions and responses to our questions have been so comprehensive that there are no further questions. I thank you both for your appearance here today. You have been most helpful. We shall study your comments with great care.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael P. Clancy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Chairman, we have one additional point to throw into the pot. It relates to the provision of safeguards for events. We are aware of the various conditions that have been laid down, but the possibility of random drug testing has not been discussed. It is technically possible for mobile laboratories to be set up and the Committee may want to consider that possibility for the future. Such provisions may not be possible in this Bill, but such a proposal should be discussed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, Minister of State, Scottish Office, 	<i>examined.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On behalf of the Committee, of which the Minister is a member, I welcome the opportunity for colleagues to question him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said at the start of the Committee's proceedings that I thought that we would end up giving the Minister a bit of a doing, and some of my colleagues were a bit shocked. Will the Minister tell us whether he believes in the Special Standing Committee principle?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, certainly. The purpose of the Bill, as far as I am concerned, is to prevent young lives from being lost. We would not lightly be forgiven if we allowed the present situation, in which young people could lose their lives by taking ecstasy, to continue. It is very useful to have special evidence sessions because we pick up much evidence from the grass roots in Scotland which would not otherwise be so readily available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After our official proceedings a few moments ago, the Law Society mentioned that in an unofficial meeting with lawyers, it had called for model conditions when guidance was given. We certainly want to proceed with those and consult on them and want them to be made readily available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also say that we chose the 1976 Act because it was strongly recommended by Dr. Clayson when we originally changed the licensing legislation. The byelaws have worked well; they have the force of a criminal law behind them if they are breached, which the other legislation would not have. In addition, there will be no duplication. For all those reasons, we think that this is the best way to proceed, but if right hon. and hon. Members have constructive ideas in Committee, we shall respond to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is fairly obvious that we have got it wrong. I assume that the Minister has had the opportunity to read the evidence, including that of Sheriff Gow in columns 52 and 53, and that of the Convention
	<span class='label label-info column'>104</span>
of Scottish Local Authorities in columns 56, 58 and 59. If the Special Standing Committee system is to work and to make any sense, the Minister should withdraw the proposals because they do not meet the concerns of the people involved. The only body which suggested that there was any benefit in the Bill was the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland at the very end of its evidence, and it was not clear to me what that benefit was. Why do not the Government withdraw the Bill and seek to amend the Act, as advised by COSLA and Sheriff Gow?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a very good reason why that would be the wrong way to proceed, as I shall explain. COSLA made certain recommendations, but it could not say what sanctions would be appropriate if the conditions were breached, or how any uniformity could be obtained. Sanctions and uniformity can be obtained under byelaws, and a key question to consider in due course is whether there should be a mandatory element, which the hon. member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) referred to earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are good reasons for going through the procedure to make byelaws, including the fact that breach of a byelaw is a criminal offence. By using the byelaw route, we are following procedures that have been followed since 1976. They are well established, well precedented, and signal the seriousness of the matter because any breach of the conditions set down under the byelaws may lead to prosecution. There is no similar liability, for example, with breaches of public entertainment licence conditions. We believe that a stronger approach needs to be taken than that which the hon. Member for Dundee, West has suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are, of course safeguards: the Secretary of State must approve the byelaws, and that is a valuable safeguard for the licence fee. As I mentioned earlier, we shall issue model byelaws and conditions as practical guidelines are issued, and there will be a right of appeal against the conditions imposed under the new byelaws. We intend to table an amendment to cover that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But the local authorities do not have to institute the byelaws in the first instance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are coming to the issue of whether they should be mandatory or not. The first thing that we will do is issue the model byelaws and conditions, which local authorities will be encouraged to adopt. We believe that flexibility is necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asks what is the point of byelaws that are not imposed on local authorities. The answer is that local authorities should have considerable discretion as to the conditions that are imposed locally. I can enumerate, if hon. Members want me to, the types of conditions that will be covered by the model guidelines. They are extensive and include such matters as the number of doors of entry and the search procedures. However, circumstances will vary from area to area. We do not want to remove all local authority flexibility and discretion in the matter. Of course, we expect that when we issue model byelaws with conditions, local authorities will follow them. We can examine in Committee whether such expectations should
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0709">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>105</span>
include a mandatory element. However, we do not want to remove from local democracy the power to insert detailed conditions that particularly suit local circumstances. I do not think that the majority of the witnesses would have recommended otherwise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the Minister's intention as to the time scale of the Bill? We all understand that that depends on parliamentary scrutiny in the Commons and the Lords, but I should like to know whether a target has been set for implementation of the Bill, including the model guidelines to which he has referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard a criticism to the effect that the wording of the Bill seems to be based on an expectation that licensing boards will acknowledge that drugs offences will be committed at the events concerned. Does the Minister accept that there may be something in that critical comment made by witnesses?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. The first answer is that the target for implementation of the Bill is as soon as practicable—as soon as we can get it through Parliament, having listened to all the arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second question is important. We are not in the business of condoning drugs in any form. I am totally opposed to drug taking. A difficult decision has to be made, however, about how far one should take the business of searching, and what training should be given to stewards. The policy should be to keep out all drugs— to make sure that nobody with drugs in his or her possession, or who has them available, should come into the arena or the rave. Stewards would be able to insist that everyone entering the event be subjected to a search of outer clothing, pockets and bags. The guidelines will cover this. Strip searches are not appropriate because they could constitute an assault, and would be too great an invasion of privacy. A question arises as to how far to go. A person cannot, by law, be compelled to be searched if he or she refuses. However, such refusal is a good reason for excluding such a person from the rave.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The evidence raised quite extensively the issue of whether stewards should receive training. I am glad to confirm that the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 provides scope for considering whether door stewarding could be made a licensed activity. That would have to be accomplished by way of order. It has been done south of the border. Local registration schemes have been set up. The guidance covers several matters including training, which might be provided by the police or by a private company. Not much pressure has been exerted in favour of such a provision in Scotland. I believe that the chief police officers are opposed to it, because they consider that it could be a drain on resources. However, that is not an insurmountable problem. The Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 provides for searching arrangements. Searches can be one of the most sensitive and difficult aspects of the matter that we are considering. It may be necessary to ensure that appropriate training and experience is provided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Earlier, the Minister mentioned that the main purpose of the measure was to save young lives. I am sure that we all agree with that aim. Has the Minister had time to read the document from the Centre for Drug Misuse Research entitled "Places and Patterns of Drug Use in the Scottish Dance Scene". Based on its own
	<span class='label label-info column'>106</span>
research, it points out what many of us know, that a majority of users of cannabis, heroin, temazepam, diazepam, solvents, cocaine and other illegal substances, last used them in a non-dance setting. I am especially concerned about that because many young people in my constituency have died from using illegal drugs, but none of them were at raves. Does the Minister feel that it is impossible to do anything about that problem by creating new legislation and that other approaches, such as support for community drugs initiatives and health education, are the only answer? Does the Minister intend to introduce measures to cope with the use of illegal, dangerous drugs in a non-dance setting?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose is to cover every conceivable eventuality and situation. For example, some raves are subject to the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, if 100 or more persons are gathered together in the open air. Other outdoor raves are not particularly common but could give rise to a breach of the peace. We want to ensure that the Bill covers all relevant circumstances in which young people are under threat and to see whether the definitions can be improved. Some of the points made would have limited the definitions so that they covered fewer situations. That is not the Bill's purpose; the purpose is to safeguard impressionable young people who might otherwise be at risk. If the drafting can be improved in Committee to cover more situations or to deal with those which are insufficiently covered, we shall consider it sympathetically.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that drugs are an immense problem throughout the nation? We cannot solve all aspects of drug abuse at one go. This Bill will tackle certain circumstances, which will bring great advantages for youngsters who enjoy the dance scene, as they have always done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister agree that the opening comments of the hon. Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Ross) were wrong in that he suggested that Sheriff Neil Gow was opposed to the Bill? Sheriff Gow's submission states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am also particularly gratified that the House has seen fit to give early implementation to the recommendations which I made at the FAI."—	<i>[Official Report, Special Standing Committee,</i> 30 January 1996; c.1.]</p></blockquote>
He said later in evidence:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I made certain recommendations at the time, and I am grateful that the Government have taken them up."—	<i>[Official Report, Special Standing Committee,</i> 30 January 1996; c.47.]</p></blockquote>
That suggests that Sheriff Gow is on board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree with my hon. Friend Sheriff Neil Gow's point, when he heard the evidence arising from the Hanger 13 case, was that the 1976 Act did not necessarily cover all the circumstances in which conditions should be made. To clarify the position, he made a call for legislation, making it clear in his evidence that he was glad that his call had been taken up so quickly. I am convinced that we would be rightly condemned if we were to do nothing. As has been rightly said, the measure is relatively minor, although it may well be sensitive, as it deals with situations in which drugs have been or may be taken. Although we are totally opposed to all drug taking, we must deal with it in a practical way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column'>107</span>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is also the general feeling in the part of Scotland where the raves at Hanger 13 were held. I was interested that the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes) said, on Second Reading, that just because one has a fire extinguisher, it does not mean that one is in favour of arson. I agree with that. We must take a hard-headed, realistic approach. The measure is one among many. The Select Committee and the drugs task force made recommendations, many of which are being implemented: the Scottish advisory committee on drug misuse has met on several occasions; drug action teams have been set up and funded; and there are now community drug action projects. There is also advice on poly-drug misuse, as one of the gravest problems that we face is that of young people taking a combination of drugs, which leads, in some cases, to death. We heard in evidence that youngsters who go into raves and take cestasy sometimes go outside and take temazepam to cool off. We are totally opposed to any form of drug taking, but we must be realistic and recognise that such abuse is going on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are also implementing other Select Committee recommendations. We have introduced a new system of recording drug deaths. The fiscals are discussing with families problems that arise from bereavements. Funding of £300,000 has been made available for community drug action projects. There are also major drug education packages—drug education is now rightly written into the curriculum, and the Scottish Drugs Forum has issued guidance no harm minimisation at rave dance events. We want to issue more comprehensive guidance, which takes account of the points that have been made in Committee. Those are just a few of the points arising from the Select Committee's recommendations, which we are implementing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the Minister a few questions? First, who did the Government consult before they drafted the Bill? Secondly, does the Minister agree in principle that underground raves should be covered by the Bill, and shall we be able to agree on a suitable amendment to that effect?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the Minister may not be aware that one of Scotland's chief constables wrote in a letter to us:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Law enforcement cannot have any impact on demand reduction because of the huge rewards available to dealers and because of the culture that has been allowed to grow throughout the United Kingdom. To that extent the criminal justice system has lost the battle against drugs and people cannot expect law enforcement officers and Health Boards alone to be successful."</p></blockquote>
Does the Minister agree with the chief constable's view that central Government need to take a bold step by setting national standards and by appointing a Minister— or drugs tsar—to co-ordinate policies across the spectrum of criminal justice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With regard to Scotland against drugs, the leaders of all the parties are combined in doing everything in their power to change attitudes, and I believe that they will be successful. The Health Education Board for Scotland is working on a package, and the leaders of the political parties will keep in touch, with full Scottish Office support—the campaign will be taken forward as appropriate. I shall not go into
	<span class='label label-info column'>108</span>
detail now, as a meeting will be held tomorrow, and I have no doubt that that will have as positive a result as earlier meetings have had.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hope that one of the Bill's effects will be to avoid the creation of circumstances in which raves go underground, which the hon. Gentleman suggested might happen. I should be grateful for any information on whether that has happened; any illegal raves should be reported to the police.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can tell the hon. Gentleman that we have consulted COSLA on a number of occasions about the need for amending legislation. On 17 and 21 February, we wrote to COSLA about the need for model licensing conditions and it replied on 8 March. The proposals in clause 2 regarding the size of licensing boards were explained to COSLA by letter on 21 June and comments were received from 15 of the new authorities and 16 of the existing councils. COSLA was sent a copy of the Bill on the day it way published and it elected not to comment at that time, but it will be valuable to receive its comments and those from other witnesses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister did not answer my questions about a drugs Minister and the chief constable's remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should wait until the leaders of the political parties in Scotland meet in the campaign for Scotland against drugs. It is not for the Committee to pre-empt its deliberations. I believe that it is doing invaluable work in creating a climate of opinion throughout Scotland, including the media, Churches and local communities to show that drug taking is socially unacceptable and a threat to the good health of young people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does it come as a surprise to the Minister that chief constables and senior policemen have said that they regard Scotland against drugs initiative as political posturing by the Government and others who have been dragged into it? They say that they have already been working on an anti-drugs strategy for the past two years, and see this new initiative as another launch of yet another high-profile press campaign, which has more to do with stealing political thunder than the real problems of resourcing, education and policing, which the drugs task force has been campaigning for in the past two years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not understand why the Minister is insisting that the Bill should go ahead when the evidence shows that COSLA was not asked about clause 1 and what the boards should do. The Minister made it clear that it was asked in detail about clause 2 and the size of the boards. It was not asked, however, about what the boards should do. Mr. Dan Russell of COSLA offered the answer when he said that the extension of the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 would be
	<br><blockquote><p>"a more enforceable way of achieving the end result."</p></blockquote>
COSLA believes that conditions should be attached to entertainment licences and that licence holders would have to abide by those conditions. Mr. Russell said that if the licence holder
	<br><blockquote><p>"fails to comply with it he commits an offence and the fiscal authorities and the police can take action against him. "[	<i>Official Report, Special Standing Committee,</i> 30 January 1996; c. 61.]</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0711">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>109</span>
Did the Minister say earlier that that was not possible under the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 and could not be made possible by an appropriate amendment? That is what was said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In reply to a question from the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart), Mr. Russell said that the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 should apply to localities and premises not covered by the Licensing (Scotland) Act 1976, thereby extending the powers to deal with venues where rave events take place. That is a sensible way forward and I cannot understand the Minister's reluctance to accept that proposal, except that he has locked himself into a set of suggestions— presumably from his civil servants—from which he is unwilling to back away. We shall have a Bill that will not properly deal with the points made by Crew 2000 and Enhance. They suggested that there should be guidelines throughout Scotland, which every licensing board would accept because they came from the Government, and which were specifically designed premises by premises and licence by licence to cover the variety of venues where raves take place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no problem with the guidelines. Model guidelines will certainly be developed, but my difficulty with COSLA's proposals is that no consideration seems to have been given to uniformity of practice. It is not clear from the evidence what sanctions will be available for breaches. It is important that they should be properly covered; byelaws do so effectively because they have the full sanction of criminal law and are not to be entered into lightly. One of COSLA's criticisms was that byelaws could become fossilised. That need not happen; byelaws can be brought up to date. Following the St. Andrew's night speech of the Secretary of State, we are consulting about how to give local authorities a greater say in the formulation of byelaws, and about how to achieve a more streamlined process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is currently no duplication between the 1982 Act and the 1976 Act. Extending the scope of the 1982 Act to cover events at which alcohol is sold would introduce an overlap between the two Acts, which Michael Clancy mentioned a few minutes ago. It would create particular problems in respect of the entertainments licence issued under the 1976 Act, which is granted in respect of places of entertainment, including dance halls. That would result in two different licences for the same sort of event—one under, the 1982 Act and one under the 1976 Act. That would introduce a further tier of bureaucracy. It is not necessary to have a two-tier system. We wish to avoid it if possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that no sanction could be applied—he did not know to what sanctions COSLA was referring to—under the entertainments licence issued under the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982. Is he saying that the 1982 Act has no sanctions and that if someone broke the conditions of an entertainments licence no sanctions could be imposed? I find that difficult to believe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely it is worth duplicating or double licensing venues and designing licences correctly for the venues if that will save the lives of young people. It seems at the moment that we will have duplication and death.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>110</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman can be quite certain that our purpose is mutual—to put into effect the necessary provisions to safeguard young people. In answer to the hon. Gentleman's specific question, the licensing authority can withdraw the licence. Byelaws are quite different. As has been said, they take time to prepare, but as they carry the sanction of the criminal law it is important that they are right. Model byelaws will be prepared for the new arrangements which will reduce preparation time. I appreciate the criticism that byelaws can become fossilised. We want a more streamlined process so that that criticism will no longer stand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Watson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no wish to start an Opposition campaign against the Government's proposals. Proposals to deal with drug taking must have all-party agreement if they are to be effective. Although my comments may appear critical, they are made in a constructive form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie) has temporarily left the Room. In relation to the comments of Sheriff Gow, who gave evidence last week, the hon. Gentleman said that he was on board. I thought that Sheriff Gow was critical of the Bill, particularly in respect of the conditions that might be attached. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"My personal view is that the Bill should be stronger than it is at the moment … I would like the model conditions to be made mandatory; otherwise, there is little point in the Bill, and the Scottish Office might have to come back later with a different or stronger form of legislation."—	<i>[Official Report, Special Standing Committee,</i> 30 January 1996; c. 53.]</p></blockquote>
That is a withering criticism from an eminent legal mind, who was directly involved in the aftermath of the Hangar 13 tragedy and made a clear report about it. Such advice should be put aside only after much consideration. I believe that Sheriff Gow's comments should be taken to heart.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, West said that legislation should be postponed until it has been redrafted. That may be ideal, but we all want something on the statute book as quickly as possible. Surely, Sheriff Gow's suggestion should be taken on board in the form of an amendment as quickly as possible. I hope that the Minister can give the Committee an assurance about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: From the Government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Watson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: From the Government, yes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Considerable criticism was also made by Mr. Russell of COSLA about the way in which licensing boards operate—a point to which my hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty) referred. Such advice should not be cast aside slightly. He talked about byelaws being bureaucratic and costly. Surely we should be taking on board such points; otherwise, what is the point of the hearings? We are not examining casual observers; they have expertise in several areas. I asked the Minister to take on board the specific points made by Sheriff Gow and Mr. Russell.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Crew 2000 and the Calton Athletic recovery group both said that they regarded the Bill, in its present form, as legitimising drug taking. In answer to a previous question, the Minister said that there was no question of that. I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0712">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>111</span>
accept that, but how do we get away from the Bill being interpreted in such a way by statutory and non-statutory organisations that deal with the effects of drug taking?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Evidence to the Committee was certainly not unanimous on a variety of points. I recognise that Sheriff Neil Gow sees merit in making it a mandatory requirement for licensing boards to make byelaws covering raves. That was the gist of what he was saying. The hon. Member for Dumbarton raised the issue. I have made it clear that local authorities should have the flexibility to write in what they perceive to be the most important conditions that reflect their local circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have an open mind as to whether there should be mandatory element and we can consider that in detail when we discuss the Bill in Committee. I do not wish to restrict the powers of local democracy or the flexibility that can be achieved by allowing licensing boards discretion in attaching conditions, but whether there should be a mandatory element can be fully examined in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Central (Mr. Watson) asked what could be done to ensure that we get across the correct messages. Part of that exercise must be to ensure that the educational scene—the curriculum—is adapted to convey the necessary drug education message. Packages for older children, such as "Drugwise Too", should be effective and include videos. The Health Education Board for Scotland should complement that and, as the hon. Gentleman knows, it is now drawing up a programme for leaders of the political parties in Scotland that will be discussed further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind hon. Members that we finish our sitting at 4.30 pm, whether or not in mid-sentence. Three members of the Committee have said that they wish to ask a question. For us to get through them, the questions and the answers must be curtailed somewhat.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Adams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We heard last week from some promoters of raves. They expressed concern that they often felt penalised when they reported incidents in such premises and that such action endangered future licences. Is there a danger that licence holders are frightened to report incidents in their premises because of that and that people who are more irresponsible are applauded for not reporting incidents in their premises?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to the important issue that was raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East. More groups seem to believe that there are now so many initiatives that we are in danger of running in 10 directions at once. On Friday, I met the drugs action team in Argyll and Clyde, which was concerned that all previous initiatives would go to the wall given the Secretary of State's announcement on yet another initiative. Would not it be sensible to adopt the suggestion of my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton that one Minister should be made responsible for dealing with all aspects of illegal drug taking? I had to go in turn to the Health Minister at the Scottish Office, the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Department of Health, the Home Office, and the Department of Trade and Industry to put in place two pieces of legislation on temazepam. Could not one
	<span class='label label-info column'>112</span>
Minister draw together all such aspects and initiatives? If that were so, instead of knee-jerk reactions and tinkering with minor pieces of legislation, we could draft substantive legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sympathetic to what the hon. Lady said about having a co-ordinating Minister. Of course, as the Secretary of State is meeting the leaders of the other political parties, it would not be right for me to pre-empt their discussions. However, the Select Committee was undoubtedly right to call for greater co-ordination. I reassure the hon. Lady that there will be absolute continuity among drug action teams. The Bill will plug the gap that Sheriff Neil Gow rightly saw when he held the fatal accident inquiry. We are right to respond quickly to his recommendations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill will provide a right of appeal to the sheriff against a licensing board's decision to refuse consent to a relevant event. We intend to table an amendment in Committee that would enable a licensee to appeal to the sheriff against any condition imposed under the new powers in the Bill in the same way that he or she might appeal against any other condition imposed under present provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister is to be taken seriously in Committee, can he tell us what amendments he intends to table to meet some of the genuine concerns expressed by people such as Sheriff Neil Gow and the COSLA representatives?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The fairest way to proceed is for the hon. Gentleman—and, indeed, other hon. Members—to table amendments which they think will improve the Bill. We shall then weigh them carefully with an open mind and come to the necessary decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked me what amendments I shall table. As I have just said, we intend to table an amendment that will enable a licensee to appeal to the sheriff against any condition imposed. At present, I have no further proposals for amendments, but I shall carefully consider whatever amendment the hon. Gentleman tables.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I really think that this afternoon's debate demonstrates the fact that the Bill has been drafted before the Minister has had time to consider it fully. I know from experience how generous the Minister can be when considering Opposition amendments with an open mind, but it is the Government's duty to table appropriate amendments and to widen the Bill's scope. The intention is to ensure that everything possible is done to save young peoples' lives through changes to the law. If the Bill is too narrowly focused, the Government did not listen to those with experience of such matters before it was drafted. It is not good enough simply to say that it is up to Opposition Members to suggest amendments. We shall do so, but the Bill is a thin foundation on which to build.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Lady for what she said, but I cannot sign a blank cheque on behalf of anyone until I have seen the terms of any amendment. The hon. Lady has been generous: she agreed on the nod to 300 amendments to the Children (Scotland) Act 1995, because she supported its aims. Preventing young people from dying or being threatened is a worthy aim, which will command general support. Of course I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0713">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>113</span>
will examine amendments with an open mind if they are aimed at improving the Bill, which is relatively modest measure but an important one, because it can make a considerable difference to the young people concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Was that a reference to the 300 amendments that were tabled at one night's notice, and which I had to spend until 4 am reading, to make sure that they were all acceptable to us?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Commissioner to the Treasury (Mr. Michael Bates)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would you agree, Lord James, that we have had three evidence-taking sittings, which concluded 40 minutes ago and brought a tremendous amount of information before you, which you will want time to reflect on before deciding what the Government will propose?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. After evidence-taking sittings, it is necessary for the evidence to be studied with the greatest care. To enable that to be done there will be an interval before the Standing Committee commences, and we will make the best possible use of the time available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister assure me that he will speak at length to those who advise him and who advised those who drafted the Bill? In the case of both the Children (Scotland) Bill and the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Bill, I had the impression that, having given the Minister advice, those who drafted the Bill were unwilling or unable to move from the position that they had found. I am sure that the Minister wishes to be generous, and if he could get his civil servants to be less rigid about these matters, we might get a Bill that is of some use. As it stands, it will be worthless in preventing individual venues from doing things that will cause serious harm to the young people of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure what the hon. Gentleman is arguing for.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For you to listen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to listen. If the hon. gentleman is asking for a mandatory requirement to be included in the Bill, we can consider that in Committee. That is one of the most important issues that came up in the evidence-taking sittings. I assure the hon. Gentleman that I will listen with the greatest care to all the arguments when we arrive in Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister seems to be cloth-eared with regard to the point that I was making. I did not speak about mandatory matters—that topic was raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Central.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We talked about the flexibility demanded by Crew 2000, and the way to attain it, as shown to us by COSLA.
	<span class='label label-info column'>114</span>
Rigid byelaws that cover a board's entire area will not allow the flexibility to deal with venue-by-venue differences. That needs to be built into individual licences. If the Minister is not willing to consider a measure that will given individual licence flexibility, the Bill will fail in its aims.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the hon. Gentleman is saying bears on what I have already said and touches on the question of whether there should be a mandatory element in the Bill. He is asking for the same thing as Crew 2000 argued for—more flexibility at local level. There are powerful arguments to be made both ways. My own conviction is that as many decision-making powers as possible should be left to the locally elected representatives, because they know their local scene best.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Model conditions have been prepared that will cover all the typical subjects relating to conditions. Those may be sufficiently comprehensive to make a mandatory element unnecessary. The local authority can get on with applying the byelaw, after developing one to suit its local circumstances, without feeling that a blueprint is being imposed on it. There is, however no unanimity of view on this, even on the hon. Gentlemen's side. I suspect that the hon. Member for Dumbarton was expressing a rather different view, which we will hear in Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Watson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I seek clarification. In reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, West, the Minister seemed to be saying that he would not table any Government amendments. Then, in response to a question from the hon. Member for Langbaurgh (Mr. Bates), he seemed to say that he would consider the matter and might table amendments. Surely it is inconceivable that, after seven or eight hours of evidence, the Minister has heard nothing that he could seize upon and say, "Yes, that would improve the Bill, and I will bring forward a Government amendment to do so."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman can look at my record. In the Children (Scotland) Bill we tabled many amendments arising out of points made by Opposition Members. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) accepted 300 of them on the nod. I do not think that that has ever happened before or since. I was very grateful to her; it was a service to get that Bill through, which commanded general support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will study the evidence that has been given. This is a short Bill, but if amendments are needed, we will table them, we must weigh each argument on its merits before taking a final view. It must be remembered that some witnesses gave contradictory evidence. The hon. Gentleman will recall one witness from Glasgow who said that he was against the Bill because he thought that it condoned drug-taking. I do not accept that at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
