	<section>
	<div class='title'>Submission by Sheriff Neil Gow QC</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<ol>
	<li>I am delighted that the Standing Committee has selected Ayr as one of the places where evidence is to be heard. The sad deaths of the three young men at Hanger 13 and the subsequent Fatal Accident Inquiry which I conducted have focussed public attention on the drugs menace.</li>
	<li>I am also particularly gratified that the house has seen fit to give early implementation to the recommendations which I made at the FAI. I am only too well aware that judicial recommendations of this kind are suitably welcomed at the time, but are then placed in a pigeon hole in the Scottish Office and forgotten about for years.</li>
	<li>I have read the terms of the draft Bill, and also the official report of the Scottish Grand Committee hearing in Glasgow on Monday 18 December 1995, which was kindly provided to me by the Hon. Member for Ayr.</li></ol></p>
	<p>Most of the points which I am going to offer for consideration by Hon. Members are probably technical points for the Committee stage.</p>
	<p>	<i>Definition of a Rave</i></p>
	<p>There is already a definition of "rave" in Section 63 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 which applies to "a gathering on land in the open air of 100 or more persons (whether or not trespassers) at which amplified music is played during the night etc". This definition of a rave did not in fact apply to the premises at Hanger 13. It is to be noted that "land in the open air" includes land partly in the open air, see Section 63(1)(10) and would thus include a barn or an aircraft hangar (sic) with the doors open, but not such buildings with the door shut. Clause 38(A)(3) gives a pretty effective definition of a rave and in my opinion is probably adequate. The vital part is the reference to "offences may be committed in relation to controlled drugs", which in the normal way would exclude boy scout dances or Scottish country dance music evenings. The definition of "music" in clause 38(A)(1)(5) is the same as that given in Section 63 of the 1994 Act. It is obviously convenient that the definition given of a word in one particular Act should be the same as that given in another Act, otherwise confusion could result.</p>
	<p>	<i>Training of Stewards</i></p>
	<p>The proper training of stewards is very important. Stewards are usually selected more for their brawn than their brain. I quite frequently hear cases of breach of the peace and assault where stewards appear to have exceeded their normal powers and used excessive or unnecessary force.</p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>46</span>
	<p>	<i>Stewards Right to Search</i></p>
	<p>Stewards have a right at common law to detain any person whom they suspect of carrying or dealing in drugs pending the arrival of the police. The position regarding searches is not so clear. When a person enters premises where a rave is being conducted, he is invariably subject to quite a severe search. It is of course an implied condition of his entering the premises that he subjects himself to such a search.</p>
	<p>I recently heard a case at Ayr which highlighted the problems with regard to searches by stewards. In that case stewards saw a young man whom they suspected loitering outside Hanger 13 in an area resorted to by drug suppliers, and suspecting that he might be involved in drugs, took him inside the building and called the police. As they did so they felt a bulge under his arm, and suspecting that he might be carrying drugs or a weapon such as a knife, they searched him. They did not find a knife, but they found 78 Temazepam tablets which they took from him and handed to the police when they arrived. The search was undoubtedly "irregular", but the legal question was whether, in the circumstances, the stewards were entitled to search the young man, having suspected he was carrying drugs or a weapon. I held that although the search was irregular, the evidence was competent, and having heard the evidence, I duly convicted the accused and sentenced him to the maximum of three months imprisonment. The case has now been appealed to the justiciary appeal court, and it will be interesting to see whether the appeal court decides that stewards have a right to search at common law in such circumstances. The alternative would be to put a power of search in the model regulations, but this could be difficult, as important matters of principle and civil liberty would become involved.</p>
	<p>	<i>Right of Appeal to Sheriff</i></p>
	<p>The draft Bill includes a clause allowing for a right of appeal to the Sheriff, and impliedly to the Court of Session on a point of law. The Sheriff Clark suggests that after the reference to right of appeal to the Sheriff the words "by way of summary application" should be added. Administrative appeals of this type usually proceed by way of summary application for which there is a standard procedure laid down, and it might be advisable to make this clear in the clause.</p>
	<p>Sheriff Neil Gow QC, 	<i>called in and examined.</i></p>
	<p>10.4 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Good morning, Sheriff Gow. On behalf of the Committee, I welcome you to this session of evidence taking. You are the first sheriff whom I have encountered in my capacity as a Chairman, but I shall be as kind and gentle to you as I am to everybody. Please introduce yourself for the record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sheriff Neil Gow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Accustomed as I am to public speaking, this is the first time that I have found myself in the dock and exposed to cross-examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I offer you, Mr. McKelvey, and all hon. Members a word of welcome. I am pleased that the Committee has decided to come to Ayr, where I conducted the fatal accident inquiry last February into the tragic deaths of three young men at Hanger 13. The primary purpose of the fatal accident inquiry was to establish formally the cause of death of the three young men. In view of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0676">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>47</span>
medical evidence there was no doubt that all three had died from an overdose of ecstasy. We wanted to find out as much as we could about the circumstances of their deaths and to discover what measures could be taken to avoid such tragedies in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I made certain recommendations at the time, and I am gratified that the Government have taken them up. The politics of the case are not a matter for me, but for hon. Members. My experience has, however, been that when judges, sheriffs or legal committees make recommendations they are too often pigeon-holed and ignored by whomever is in power in St. Andrew's house. That has not happened in this case, and I am pleased mat my recommendations have been taken up so quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that hon. Members have before them the report that I made for the fatal accident inquiry. We looked closely at what we could do in the future. My recommendations covered several detailed matters, which the Committee will consider. I had in mind that the Scottish Office would promulgate model regulations, which would be available to local authorities in Scotland and which they could implement as they chose. Those regulations would allow greater supervision of premises in which raves—so-called—were to take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my written observations to the Committee, I have detailed some matters that are probably more appropriate to the Committee stage of the Bill, but I hope that they will be noted and considered at the proper time. I would be happy to discuss any matters that relate to the inquiry or to the background circumstances of the three deaths.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be appropriate for me to comment in some detail on certain technical aspects of the Bill, particularly the possibility of a right of search and the training, qualifications and supervision of stewards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Sheriff Gow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It gives me great pleasure that the Committee has come to Ayr—it is the first time that a House of Commons Committee has done so, and I hope that it will not be the last. I am especially delighted that Sheriff Gow has come to give evidence. It was widely accepted that his inquiry into events at Hanger 13 was worthwhile, and his conclusions were welcomed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One issue that we must consider is the difference between raves and dance halls. The Bill attempts to define a rave. How do you feel about that, and how would you differentiate between the two?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sheriff Neil Gow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Gallie, you are my Member of Parliament, and I thank you for liaising and making it possible for me to attend today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far as your question is concerned, paragraph (3) gives a definition of "rave" in the terms of the Bill. It differs quite substantially from the other definition I have referred to, and which the Minister referred to, in section 63 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994. That did not apply to Hanger 13 but to functions held in the open air. We had such a function in the Ayrshire countryside a couple of years ago and the matter came before me by way of appeal; I granted permission for it to proceed. That was a different kind of rave. What
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>48</span>
we are talking about here is something that is held on premises where music is played and so on. I am happy with the definition in the Bill. It does not give it in terms of a definition but states that the section applied to any event "which is held in premises…" and so on. So we are talking about something that is held indoors or largely indoors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question arises of whether the new section would apply to things like boy scout dances or Scottish country dance evenings. In my view it does not because new section 38A(3) (d) says that it applies at any event
	<br><blockquote><p>"at which it appears to the board that offences may be committed in relation to controlled drugs".</p></blockquote>
I would not anticipate that drugs would normally be available at boy scout dances or Scottish country dance society evenings. So any anxiety that hon. Members might have on that matter can be laid to rest because it is clear that before any licensing occurs, the board must think that there is a chance of drugs being made available at the function.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have thought about it and I cannot suggest any improvement to subsection (3), bearing in mind that "rave" is given a statutory definition different from that in the 1994 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Several hon. Members have indicated that they want to ask a question. Does any hon. Member want to question Sheriff Gow on definitions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eastwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could Sheriff Gow clarify his point? He said that he was content with the definition given in the Bill but in his evidence he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is obviously convenient that the definition given of a word given in one particular Act should be the same as that given in another Act".</p></blockquote>
The definition in section 63 of the 1994 Act is clearly different from the definition given in the Bill. Is Sheriff Gow implying that he is content with the definition in the Bill but that section 63 should eventually be amended because confusion is clearly possible if a term is defined differently in two different Acts?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sheriff Neil Gow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take your point, Mr. Stewart. The side heading for the clause reads: "Licensing conditions for raves". The clause does not say "the definition of a rave shall be as follows…", it simply says that the new subsection "applies to any event". So it is not as clear-cut as it might be. The preamble to the Bill simply says it will
	<br><blockquote><p>"enable licensing boards to make byelaws…relating to certain events involving music and dancing".</p></blockquote>
So the parliamentary draftsman has obviously avoided a specific definition of the word "rave" and I have no doubt that he did so because a statutory definition already exists in section 63 of the 1994 Act. I would have thought it would be better to leave matters as they stand. The side heading is purely available for interpretation and is not part of the Bill itself. That is how I would reconcile the two different definitions of "rave". In fact, it might be better not to talk about raves at all in the side heading.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McFall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I follow the question of the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) about the definition of "rave"? At the Scottish Grand Committee on 18 December, we had quite a discussion
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0677">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>49</span>
about the definition, which many of us considered to be too wide. You take refuge in the fact that a rave will be an event at which drugs could possibly be used, but that raises several important questions about the material on which the board will rely to reach its conclusion that offences might be committed and about the sources of information available to the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that we be fair to licence holders, but we must also recognise that information might come to the board's attention through the police on a confidential basis. It would be improper for the police to release confidential information. Because there could be information that cannot be placed in the public domain, boards would have to assume that drugs might be used at certain events. That would offer licence holders and their lawyers the right to an appeal, which could get us into a muddy situation. I suggest that paragraph (d) is not as clear as one might think. Although you might interpret it clearly and logically, it could be subject to different interpretations elsewhere. A judicial review could be possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sheriff Neil Gow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point— there is a good deal in what he says. I am a little concerned. The words are:
	<br><blockquote><p>"at which it appears to the board",</p></blockquote>
which is a wide and indefinite way to put things, but I understand why it is put that way. I anticipate that the licensing board of a specific region would receive information from various sources, especially, I would imagine, from the police, but I wonder how that information would be presented to the board. What cannot happen and would give grounds for an appeal to the sheriff would be if information were surreptitiously passed to the chairman of the licensing board, who considered it and mentioned it to other members of the board, although it was not put before the licence holder. I should have thought that if justice were done in that way, the licence holder would have sound and plausible grounds for appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a difficulty, but the licensing board must be given a certain amount of discretion and when the Bill states, "appears to the board", it does not mean corroborated evidence—the type of term that lawyers would use. The phrase is pretty wide. Were the case to go to the sheriff on appeal, the sheriff would examine the legal aspect and ask whether the actions were unjust, the procedure unfair, information kept back from the licence holder or confidential information used by the board. If the police make representations, I do not see much difficulty with information being put before the board on paper and being shown to the licence holder without it going into the public domain. I see no difficulty with that. I take your point, Mr. McFall—it is an important one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Your comments are fascinating. On availability, you said that drugs were freely available both outside and inside Hanger 13. It would be helpful if, from the evidence that you heard, you could suggest whether you think the problem of drug taking was greater before the persons concerned entered the club or whether surreptitious dealing within Hanger 13 was the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You also mentioned searching searchers and bar staff. Did you perceive that to be a big problem or a potential one? You recommended model conditions in licences on
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>50</span>
numbers, stewarding and searches. Would you like to add to that? Perhaps you might tell us exactly what types of conditions and the extent of them, and what guidance, arising from the legislation, you think the Scottish Office could usefully give later on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sheriff Neil Gow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You have taken several points which I shall try to deal with in turn. I perceived that there was a risk from the misuse of drugs both inside and outside Hanger 13. The management appear to have been aware of that because they kept surveillance on the queue of young people outside waiting to be searched. I was specifically told in evidence that the stewards patrolled the queue to make sure that young people were not taking drugs while they waited to get in, or supplying drugs in the queue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not entirely sure how drug dealers work. Obviously, if they have to pass through a search at the door some people might wish to take on board the drugs before they go in but I would have thought that the majority of young people who wanted to obtain drugs would wait until they were inside and would then try to get them from dealers. I know from the Hanger 13 inquiry and other cases concerning Hanger 13 that I have dealt with that drugs are available in the external precincts of the building. The stewards keep an eye on those as well. I understand from evidence in other cases that there are certain areas where drug dealers hang about. When the young people come out, they can get drugs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may elaborate on that briefly, I understand that the practice is—you may hear evidence from other medical experts on this—that young people take ecstasy when they go to a place at the start of the evening, which gives them the high or the relaxation or whatever thrill they get from it. When they come out at 1 or 2 in the morning, to bring them down and cool them down, they then take temazepam, something I learnt only after the Hanger 13 inquiry. Temazepam is, as you know, prescribed as a sleeping pill. Apparently they hope that it will bring them back to a more normal equilibrium. So in a typical rave scenario, you have young people queuing to get in, looking for drugs in the queue, passing the search and looking for drugs inside the building. When they come out, the wheel comes full circle and they look for more drugs to bring them down from the effects of ecstasy. Apparently that is quite common. I was not aware of it when I held the inquiry, but I am aware of it now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to searches of staff, I noted in my report that the entertainers—the disc jockeys, the performers and their retinue of hangers-on—were all searched for drugs but I discovered during my questioning that the staff themselves at Hanger 13 were not searched, which I thought slightly surprising. The management said that it was a matter that they would rather deal with themselves; they trusted their own staff and if they could not trust them, who could they trust? I did not make any recommendation but left the matter to the management, subject to advice from the police. What was your third point, Lord James?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: About model conditions in licences and what you would like to see them cover, with particular regard to numbers, stewarding and searches; and what further guidance you think the Scottish Office might usefully give in due course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>51</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sheriff Neil Gow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These are technical matters. I would certainly like to see more consideration given to the qualifications of stewards. As I said in my observations, stewards are to my mind chosen for their brawn rather than for their brains. They do not seem to have the training that the police have in handling young people diplomatically in suspicious circumstances. There are incidents when the stewards tend to overreact and use more force than the law allows. Whether we should have people qualified as stewards is a matter for further argument. I am not sure how far one could go in that direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Bringing in outside security control firms was another matter discussed at the inquiry. The management's view—and I can understand it—was that it was better to use their own stewards, some of whom they had employed for many years. They were largely local people who knew the local patrons. We should bear in mind that many people came to Hanger 13 from Glasgow and the central belt. Some came from even further afield. The police gave us a breakdown of where people came from: the majority were from the west of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Stewards tend to know their own regular patrons and the troublemakers too. I do not see much advantage in employing an outside security firm for stewarding provided that local arrangements are considered adequate by the police.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also concerned about the right to search, which I mentioned in my observations. If you will permit me, Mr. Mckelvey, I would like to enlarge on the subject for a moment. I know of a recent case from Hanger 13, which I narrated in my observation. A young man was suspected of having drugs on his person for supply to others. He was put outside but they did not find any drugs on him. Later in the evening he was seen loitering in an area immediately outside Hanger 13 which was known to be frequented by drug suppliers. The steward got hold of him and felt something suspicious on his person. The young person was then taken inside the building on the grounds that he either had a weapon on him or was carrying illegal drugs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He was searched there and then, which was strictly beyond the normal common law powers of a citizen who suspects a person of committing an offence. The stewards were entitled under common law to detain him, pending the arrival of the police, but the question arose whether they were also entitled to search him. There was no doubt in my mind that the search they carried out was irregular, but the legal question was whether the evidence, having being obtained in an irregular way without a search warrant and so on, was none the less competent in my court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ruled in that case that although there was no search warrant, the circumstances—with the stewards being afraid that the person might be carrying a knife, which he was not—entitled them to search him in the interest of their own safety. The stewards found 78 temazepam tablets on him, which they handed over to the police. That evidence was admissible. I convicted the young man and sentenced him to three months' imprisonment, but the case has been referred to the Justiciary Appeal Court and I understand that the case will probably be heard in the late spring—round about April. It will be a very significant case in this particular area of the law. It will clarify whether stewards can search in those circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>52</span>
If the Committee is considering model conditions, it should establish whether stewards should be given the right to search or not. This is a question fraught with all sorts of difficulties and dangers. It involves the issue of civil liberty and I am not sure that it is appropriate to put a right of search into model conditions just like that. The issue of individual freedom is very large and it may not be appropriate, as I say, for it to be considered in the context of model regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem came up a few weeks ago in a clear-cut way. I am awaiting with great interest the decision of the Justiciary Appeal Court on that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In your submission to the Committee, you stated in paragraph 2 that you were particularly
	<br><blockquote><p>"gratified that the House has seen fit to give early implementation to recommendations which I made at the FAI."</p></blockquote>
I have a copy of your judgment before me. On page 10, you recommend that the Scottish Office treats as a matter of considerable urgency the preparation in legislative form of model conditions and licences for raves, giving, in particular, details of the numbers stewarding, conditions for searches and so on. In that light, we need to recognise that new section 38A in clause 1 lays down no model conditions and no requirements for them. Indeed, there is nothing mandatory in the Bill. New section 38A (1) applies only if a licensing board decides to make byelaws. No duty is imposed on boards to make such byelaws, so if a board does not opt to introduce them, the provisions will have no effect. That makes redundant your plea for the Scottish Office to treat the preparation of model conditions as a matter of urgency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are 56 licensing boards in Scotland, of which only 43 have issued byelaws of any description. The Bill will therefore perpetuate the present system with no obligation placed on local authorities. Uniformity of provision will not be attained, but we need basic model conditions to be established by local authorities, obviously in agreement with licensing authorities, the police and others. Without that, the Bill will come to nothing. I would like to hear your comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sheriff Neil Gow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see what you mean, Mr. McFall, and you have identified a major problem that goes to the heart of the Bill. My recommendation was that the Scottish Office should get on with the preparation in legislative form of model conditions. I assumed that, in conjunction with various advisory bodies, the Scottish Office would prepare model conditions to cover supply of cold water, cooling areas and that sort of thing. Those conditions would be in place but I envisage that it would be up to a particular licensing board to decide whether to adopt them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You put your finger on a real problem, Mr. McFall. Perhaps the House should look more closely into the situation and make it mandatory for local boards to adopt those model conditions. But that is not a matter for me. It is a political decision. I went as far as to say that model conditions should be set up. Any sensible licensing board will adopt them—at least most, if not all, the conditions. The Bill does not make that mandatory. I suggest that that is an important political decision. I do see your point, Mr. McFall, and it is a very important one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You are the only legal person from whom we shall hear evidence, so it is important that your comments are taken seriously. One of the reasons for the sitting of this Special Standing Committee is to ensure that politicians who have relatively little expertise are well informed about relevant matters. However, I should perhaps declare an interest because the Chairman and I used to run discos for the Labour party in Dundee. We employed stewards to ensure that there was no trouble. Along with the majority of people, we went for brawn rather than brain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Your comments this morning expose the weakness in the Bill. Unless we exploit it to good purpose, we will have missed the opportunity. Do you agree, following on from what my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) said, that the Bill is not really a response to our problems? It deals with the narrow issue of licensing raves, but not with real concerns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You spoke about the need for stewards and about the civil liberties argument that would quickly be raised if the Scottish Office introduced model regulations to give stewards greater powers. If the appeal against your decision is lost, which is likely given the stewards' action, every sheriff's efforts will be set back in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the Bill's weaknesses, would not it be better for the Minister to propose further legislation? He could take the present, narrow Bill away and bring it back in a more suitable form or he could introduce other legislation to take account of the problems in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sheriff Neil Gow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Ross) tempts to me to step into murky political waters, which I am reluctant to do as a sheriff. My personal view is that the Bill should be stronger than it is at the moment. As I said to the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall), I would like the model conditions to be made mandatory; otherwise, there is little point in the Bill, and the Scottish Office might have to come back later with a different or stronger form of legislation. These are, however, matters for you—they are political, not legal matters. I am rather chary of expressing an official view on them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallic</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Scottish Drugs Forum has produced guidelines, which have been drawn to the attention of the Scottish Office. I hope that national mandatory guidelines will be introduced, but the licensing boards carry local representatives, and they must be flexible—some details can, after all, be determined only locally. We are all sympathetic to the idea of mandatory guidelines, but other aspects should be determined by local people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue of stewards was important in the Hanger 13 situation. Some qualifications should be required, and the guidelines should deal with that. In addition, there should be a legal requirement to define the extent of stewards' powers to search. It was a fact of life at Hanger 13 that people had to submit to an extensive search if they wanted to get in. The law may sometimes have been breached, so I hope that stewards can be covered in the Bill that we finally produce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps we should give stewards the right to restrain, as long as they use reasonable levels of force. As you said, you used your discretion in court when stewards had found an individual with drugs. Some guidance on the way in which we could achieve those measures would be helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>54</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are almost out of time, but I shall let the meeting run until quarter to 11 because we started late and two questions are left.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sheriff Neil Gow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will be brief, Mr. Chairman: I realise the constraints of time. The hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie) raises an important point with regard to local licensing boards. Sitting as a sheriff, I get a number of appeals from the local licensing board during the course of a year to do with entertainments—places where fruit machines are used or licensed premises for alcohol and that kind of thing. I am very conscious of the fact that they are the locally elected representatives of the people. In several cases—in many cases perhaps—I do not agree with the view that the local board has taken. But I always make it clear to them and to the public that the sheriff's function in these appeals is not to impose his own views, but simply to make sure that the normal legal procedures have been correctly followed, that witnesses have been heard, each side has had a right to put their own case, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Gallie is, I am sure, well founded in his view that great emphasis must be laid on the fact that these are local people, local representatives, local boards. There is also an argument for saying, "Well, central Government can draw up these model conditions, but at the end of the day it is the local councillors and the local members who know their own scenario in their own home town and should decide whether they are to be imposed or not." Mr. Gallie puts his finger on the point very neatly when emphasising that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, and very briefly, Mr. Chairman, with regard to stewards and the right of search, I have indicated the problem to you. My advice to hon. Members is to be rather fearful about putting a right of search into the model conditions, because it raises fundamental aspects of civil liberty. I do not think that, in a Bill of this kind, which is largely a regulatory Bill, major matters of principle concerning civil rights and liberties should be raised. At the moment I would not be in favour of going so far as to give a general right of search to stewards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eric Clarke 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Midlothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am in a bit of a dilemma, because you, Sheriff Gow, have laid emphasis on civil liberties. I regularly go on a plane, as everyone else does, and I am searched. I go to a football match and I can be challenged and searched. For many years I was president of a large labour club and I ran dances. There is an old adage that if you run dances you should keep your trouble outside—that means weapons and undesirable people. If they are kept out at the door, there should be no problems inside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Are you saying to us, Sheriff Gow, that our hands are tied because of the problem of civil liberties? It may be annoying to be searched for weapons when getting on a plane—drugs are harder to detect and easier to conceal than weapons—but how do we overcome the problem? How do we legislate so that the law is not abused? How do we protect young people who do not want to get involved in drugs?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before you respond, Sheriff Gow, I want Mr. Devlin to ask his question so that you have three minutes to wind up the session.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Devlin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stockton, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have two brief questions. First, is not it possible, even in Scotland, for the owner of an establishment to impose his own search
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0680">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>55</span>
conditions at the door? Secondly, since your helpful judgment in which you called for legislative conditions on licences, have you, in your reflections on the subject, thought of any other recommendations that you would have included in the judgment were you giving it today?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sheriff Neil Gow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To reply first to the hon. Member for Stockton, South (Mr. Devlin), I do not propose to add anything to what I said in my report or in my observations with regard to recommendations. I think you have quite enough on your plate as it is. But the question of search is a delicate and a tricky one. I shall just say briefly that the position in common law is that stewards have a right to detain a person—a citizen's arrest, if you like—if they suspect that he is carrying drugs inside or outside the Hanger, or wherever it is. As I understand the law, they do not at the moment have a common law right to search, although in certain circumstances evidence obtained from an irregular search may be admissible in court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far as Hanger 13 and similar premises are concerned, it is an implied or indeed express condition that you do not get in unless you are searched. In the case that I quoted, the person had been put out after a search had disclosed nothing. He was later suspected of trafficking drugs and was arrested under common law powers and brought back in and searched, while awaiting the arrival of the police. There is an argument that the club workers went as far as they were entitled to under common law—namely, to detain him, call for the police and wait and see. My specific concern was that he might have been carrying a weapon. They thought that he was. He was not, fortunately, but that is why they searched him, I think. This is a delicate matter and I do not really want to move from my position that the Committee should think carefully before putting a formal right to search in the model conditions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eric Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My point concerned searching. There are similarities. Legislation has been passed for people to be stopped and searched at airports and football matches. Again, that is a condition: people do not get on board or on to the premises unless they agree to be searched.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sheriff Neil Gow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is so. That is a conditional right of search. It is implied or expressed in what you are doing—boarding an aircraft—that you must agree to the search. But to take the other case, if members of the airport staff saw a person loitering at Prestwick airport, for example, and suspected that he might be a drugs courier, they would be entitled to detain him, but not, as I understand it, to search him—he would not be boarding an aircraft and accepting the condition of search. If I might say so,- you have to distinguish between circumstances where you agree to being searched if that is necessary, but if you are inside the precincts of the airport—in the concourse—airport security staff cannot come up and search you for drugs just like that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you very much, Sheriff Gow. Your answers have been comprehensive. I am sure that further study of what you have had to say will give members of the Committee much to think about when they start to deliberate the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Submission by the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities</p>
	<p>1.1.1 The Licensing (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill introduces new measures to enable licensing boards constituted under the Licensing (Scotland) Act 1976 to make licensing conditions for dancing events known as "raves", which is not a statutorily defined term but one in popular use for events where music, lighting and other effects are used to create a highly charged atmosphere of excitement and partying. Raves are attended predominantly by young persons and experience shows that among participants there are some who use drugs.</p>
	<p>1.2 The need for special measures to minimise any effects adverse to the health of participants has been recognised by local authorities in respect of events of this type held in places of public entertainment licensed under the Civil Government (Scotland) Act 1982.</p>
	<p>1.3 Under the 1982 Act the local authority has discretion to determine and impose such conditions as it deems necessary for the grant of a public entertainment licence. The conditions usually deal with matters of safety of premises in regard to fire precautions, limitations on numbers of people attending events in the premises licensed and other appropriate matters affecting the proper control of events. These controls can be very varied and each type may require specific conditions.</p>
	<p>2.2.1 The Licensing (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill seeks 	<i>inter alia</i> to introduce measures to provide a more strict regime of conditions to control the conduct of premises within scope of the Licensing (Scotland) Act 1976 	<i>et seq</i> and in this regard the Bill is not considered to be a useful measure at all.</p>
	<p>2.2 The main reason that the provisions detailed in clause 1 are not considered to be worth enacting is the need they would create for licensing boards to go through the slow and bureaucratic procedures associated with their powers to make byelaws in terms of section 38 of the 1976 Act. A copy of the section is annexed.</p>
	<p>2.3 The byelaw-making procedures are legalistic and require public notice of the licensing board's intention to make a byelaw to introduce new conditions to licences to control raves. Objections to the board's proposals are allowed, again with time-consuming procedures to deal with or dispose of them. Finally the Secretary of State's approval is required before the byelaw can be made by the board.</p>
	<p>2.4 Thus, instead of the bureaucratic procedure proposed by clause 1 of the Bill, what is required is a new power for boards to enable them, at their own discretion, to determine and impose licensing conditions for the control of raves which come within scope of the 1976 Act Such a measure is as easy to legislate for as the cumbersome one proposed.</p>
	<p>2.5 Clause 1 of the Bill as drafted is an ineffective over-reaction to incidents such as occurred in the premises known as Hangar 13 in Ayrshire.</p>

	<p>3.3.1 COSLA supports the provision in clause 2 of the Bill governing the size and composition of divisional licensing boards, having been first consulted on the proposal because anomalies were envisaged in certain new councils' areas following upon the reorganisation of local government in April 1996. There is annexed a copy of COSLA's submission in response to the Scottish Office consultation on the size of divisional boards.</p>
	<p>4.4.1 Local authorities and licensing boards promote good practice in the running of events such as raves. There is annexed a COSLA response to a consultation by the Scottish Drugs Forum on their Proposed Guidelines for Good Practice at Dance Events.</p>
	<p>	<b>Annexe 1 to COSLA Submission:</b></p>

	<p>	<i>Local Government Reorganisation Future Size of Licensing Boards</i></p>
	<p>With the benefit of views expressed on behalf of ten new councils and ten district councils COSLA supports your Department's proposals to amend the Licensing (Scotland) Act 1976 to provide a minimum membership of five for a board for a new council area or a divisional area and a minimum requirement for membership of divisional boards of one quarter of the members for the area of the division.</p>
	<p>When the amending legislation has been enacted it may be appropriate to remind the new councils that establishment of divisional boards may contribute to achieving a worthwhile decentralisation objective. Councils could also be reminded that the new statutory minimum requirements do not preclude the exercise of the discretionary power to increase membership of boards to meet objectives such as adequate local representation.</p>
	<p>	<b>Annexe 2 to COSLA Submission:</b></p>
	<p>	<b>Letter to Scottish Drugs Forum</b></p>
	<p>	<i>Scottish Drugs Forum Draft Guidelines for Good Practice at Dance Events</i></p>
	<p>I refer again to your letter of 30 June 1995. COSLA offers the following comments on your draft of proposed Guidelines for Good Practice at Dance Events:
	<ol>
	<li>The draft is comprehensive and based on excellent intentions, but it may prove difficult to secure implementation of all of the recommendations.</li>
	<li>The text would benefit by being made more succinct, with less background explanation interwoven with the practical recommendations. The latter should be set out in such a way as to be suitable for use as a check list. The explanations on which the recommendations are based could be attached as an appendix.</li>
	<li>An example of the check list approach is provided by the Guidelines for Good Practice at Discos and Night Clubs produce by the Licensing Board in East Kilbride in co-operation with the management of discos in the town centre and the police. A copy is enclosed. It will be noted that the substance of the recommendations is very close to that of the recommendations in the Scottish Drugs Forum draft.</li>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>58</span>
	<li>It is considered that the approach of the Licensing Board in East Kilbride, which consisted in seeking voluntary adoption of the Guidelines, was particularly helpful. Such a co-operative approach is highly recommended.</li>
	<li>West Lothian District Council provides a further example of a clear, plainly expressed list in its standard conditions for all-night musical events, a copy of which is also enclosed.</li></ol></p>
	<p>Mr. Dan Russell, Head of Legal and Administration Services, South Ayrshire Council, 	<i>called in and examined.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are running a few minutes late. We shall attempt to make the time up without cutting your time, Mr. Russell. When we get into technicalities, it is almost impossible to give a cryptic answer, but if we get shorter questions, we can perhaps elicit shorter answers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dan Russell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am here to explain the attitude of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities to this problem. At the outset, I want to say that COSLA in general supports the efforts being made from several quarters to address the issues. It has already made comments through the Scottish Drugs Forum and has referred to best practice guidelines which are already in force in some licensing areas—for example, West Lothian and East Kilbride. I am particularly familiar with the East Kilbride guidelines, if there are any questions on those later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Basically, the COSLA suggestion is that there is a better way to implement the proposals. At the moment, the Bill proposes that that be done by way of byelaws. I should like to suggest that there are various reasons why that is not the most attractive or effective way to implement the proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Byelaws require a certain procedure to be carried out which, in itself, is bureaucratic. To some extent that may explain why, generally, byelaws, once made, tend not to be changed. Perhaps that is just the lethargic process of trying to change byelaws once they are in place. There is a danger that once the proposals have been put into byelaws, they tend to become fossilised and licensing boards have difficulty in changing them once they are made. That is important, because there is an ever changing scene out there. From time to time, licensing boards want to change the conditions that they impose; although they might start off with a set of standard conditions, two or three years down the road there may be a need to revise them, but if they are set in byelaws, it is more difficult to make the changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What COSLA would like to propose as an alternative is for the Bill, instead of being drafted as it is now, to provide a power to licensing boards to attach conditions to the granting or renewal of licences. It is as simple as that. That would give licensing boards the opportunity to apply standard conditions—which would no doubt be produced in Scottish Office guidelines—to premises as they come up. In other words, conditions could be tailored to meet the circumstances and nature of particular premises, as well as the nature of raves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that raves have been defined—or accepted as defined—in the Bill but they can cover a variety of circumstances, including opening hours, the number of people attending and the nature of the premises where the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0682">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>59</span>
rave is to be held. It is important that the conditions being imposed by the licensing board are appropriate for those premises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons, COSLA proposes that the Bill should give licensing boards the power to impose conditions on the granting or renewal of licences. That would be on the basis that the imposition of any conditions would also be subject to appeal to the Sheriff. In other words, if a particular licence holder thought that he was being hard done by, he could appeal to the sheriff. There would also be a provision that would allow the licensing board to vary the conditions attached to a licence during its currency. Licences are granted for three years at a time and the power to vary the conditions would allow both the licensing board and the licence holder to apply to vary the conditions during the three-year life of the licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
COSLA proposes that the report that is in place under the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 be applied to the Licensing (Scotland) Act 1976. It is not proposing anything new; the provisions are already contained in the 1982 Act. From a practitioner's point of view, I think that COSLA and licensing boards and licensing clerks would prefer to be working to the 1982 licensing scheme rather than to what is being proposed at present. I am happy to answer questions, Mr. McKelvey.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you. Your statement is extremely useful. We do not normally start these sittings with statements but this is a highly technical matter and therefore statements from witnesses are to be encouraged. That is not to say that I want you to talk from now until the end, but your statement was very helpful, and I know that hon. Members have picked up what you have said and are already framing their questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to ask how well you think byelaws have worked over the years. Since you are calling for a more radical approach than that in the Bill, does it follow that you would also favour a general review of Scottish liquor licensing law in which all relevant interests could express their views?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dan Russell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the first point, byelaws have been a useful tool for licensing boards in the past but I have doubts as to how effective they have been. I think that I explained that in my opening statement. What tends to happen is that licensing boards introduce, with the best of intentions, byelaws to cover a particular set of circumstances and those byelaws then tend to sit on the shelf for the next 10 or 15 years. They become fossilised, out of date and no longer applicable to changing circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to your second point: yes, I do believe there should be a review of the Licensing (Scotland) Act 1976. The whole Act needs to be reviewed and in particular the categories of licence that are available for licensing bodies to grant. Hon. Members should also be aware that rave events, or events very similar to raves, tend to be held on a range of premises. Licences can occasionally be granted for premises that are not normally licensed; dance and disco events can be held under public entertainment licences and public house licences. So it is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>60</span>
important that what COSLA is suggesting—the power to apply conditions to any type of licence—would cover the existing situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was reading COSLA's submission today; it says that clause 1 is an over-reaction to incidents such as those that occurred in Hanger 13. I have noted the sort of byelaws that authorities such as West Lothian and Stirling use—indeed I have Stirling's byelaws in front of me. They are very detailed, consisting of 26 clauses that cover numbers, stewarding, consultation with the police and so on. I appreciate your point that we could perhaps make better use of the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 and of the Licensing (Scotland) Act 1976, but given that the Bill will be passed, what can we add, particularly to clause 1, so that it will be effective and will complement the existing legislation? You will be aware of the discussion that we had with Sheriff Neil Gow, in which we talked about model conditions. A mandatory element is required because at the moment only 43 of Scotland's 56 local authorities have byelaws on the matter. We need uniformity, but we must also have flexibility at local level so that a consensual approach can be taken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dan Russell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I very much take that point, but I think there is a difficulty in making the provisions any more mandatory than they are at the moment. Certainly there is a duty on all licensing boards to have regard to the making of byelaws. No doubt we will receive advice from the Scottish Office and various other sources on model conditions that should be adopted. I am sure that licensing boards will appreciate the problems and issues and will make byelaws. If the Bill is to be enforced, I am sure that licensing boards will take advantage of its powers and make them work as best they can. The difficulty with mandatory provision is that discretion has to be left to licensing boards because of the different circumstances in each locality and in almost each set of premises. I think that at the end of the day discretion has to be left with each licensing board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallic</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was surprised that you said that byelaws tended to become fossilised. Surely local authorities have the right and the responsibility constantly to review byelaws so that if they do not suit the situation, they can be changed? That gives them flexibility. If we bind authorities too tightly with national legislation, it makes their lives even more difficult and they lose their control. It frequently takes a long time to encourage change in national legislation, in the first instance, and even in Government guidelines.

Secondly, how much, if any, contact have you had with Kyle and Carrick district council on Hanger 13? One difficulty it had was in regulating numbers. It had no powers that it could use in that regard. Do you feel that that issue is covered by the Bill and, if not, do you have any recommendations to make?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dan Russell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the question of byelaws becoming fossilised, which was the word that I used, I believe that that is what happens. Not because licensing boards or local authorities deliberately take that line— because authorities now have a duty to review their
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0683">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>61</span>
byelaws on a regular basis—but partly because the procedure for enacting byelaws in the first place, implementing them and then changing them is time-consuming and bureaucratic. There are rights of appeal. The change has to be confirmed by the Secretary of State and a whole process has to be gone through. Practice in the past has tended to confirm that that is what happens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 came into force, all—or most—of the byelaws in existence before that date ceased to have effect and any new ones had to be approved by the Secretary of State. The result at that time was that huge numbers of byelaws, some dating back to the last century, were swept away and now local authorities are working with a very small number of byelaws that are still in force. I would support that entirely, but it backs up my point that byelaws, once made, tend to sit on the shelf for a number of years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, with regard to the numbers in premises, yes, that could be taken on board in regard to these particular byelaws; I have no doubt that a licensing board could enact byelaws restricting the number of persons who could have access to premises. Equally, though, that could also be imposed by COSLA's suggestion that conditions be attached to licences. I feel that particular condition is more likely to be upheld in court if it is imposed as a condition applying to those particular premises. The licence-holder then has a chance to appeal against that condition. If he does not appeal, then he is obliged to abide by that condition and, presumably, if he fails to comply with it he commits an offence and the fiscal authorities and the police can take action against him. I feel that it is a more enforceable way of achieving the end result.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would have to be a very detailed formula that could enable authorities to be specific on numbers from a remote position. It would be easier for people locally to determine the relevant numbers by looking at premises and their facilities. Could you respond on that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dan Russell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely. My position is that the licensing board should have the discretion to limit numbers, if it feels that that is required, and should do that by means of a condition attached to the individual licence for the individual premise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill, as we have heard from Sheriff Gow, will not deal with the problem that we are all trying to tackle. It is looking more and more like the usual politician's reaction to a tragic set of circumstances. COSLA members will again be left to carry the can for politicians seeking a quick fix rather than dealing with the concerns that have been expressed. It is clear from your submission this morning that you do not agree that the legislation is the best way to proceed. Was COSLA consulted before the Government produced the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dan Russell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not too clear about the various stages at which COSLA was consulted, but it has been consulted by the Scottish Office by letter at various stages during 1995. It has given submissions through the Scottish Drugs Forum and expressed its views to the Scottish Office. From memory, that was in October or November.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>62</span>
It is also my understanding that COSLA was not consulted on the detail of the Bill. It has not been consulted about the final Bill until now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of this evidence-taking session is allegedly to ensure that the Bill is right. The alleged purpose of the Special Standing Committee is to allow politicians with little experience to gain knowledge from practitioners. In July 1995, Mr. Ray McCluskey wrote to COSLA and COSLA wrote back to Mr. West at the Scottish Office. It was clear from COSLA's submission that it thought that the Government were proceeding in the wrong manner. There is no point in this Committee meeting unless we have on the record clear evidence with which we can challenge the Government during the Committee stage of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton said earlier to Sheriff Gow that the Bill was likely to be passed, but it should not be passed if it was the wrong legislation. We need to pursue that point as far as we can. Mr. Russell, would you say that COSLA's recommendations in its submission, especially in paragraph 6, would be a better way to proceed rather than the narrow way in which we intend to proceed if the Bill is unamended?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dan Russell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, COSLA's position has been consistent and clear all the way through. We recommended to the Government whenever we could that what should be looked at was the power for licensing boards to attach conditions. That has been and remains the COSLA position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
COSLA doubts whether the proposal will be effective. There seems to COSLA to be a relatively simple way— and one just as easy to legislate for—of providing an effective means of ensuring that what is being aimed at can be achieved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to follow on from the two points that the hon. Member for Dumbarton made earlier. I am not entirely clear what COSLA is asking for with regard to public entertainment licences that cannot be delivered under the 1982 Act, except for the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr made about numbers. There are clear difficulties with numbers: the question of giving licensing boards the power to limit numbers was considered by the House of Commons under the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Scotland Act 1990 and was thrown out. Putting it at its simplest, if an owner can have only 200 people on his premises and he has 200 people when four policemen walk in, he is breaking the law. It is not an easy concept, which is why the House of Commons has not previously enacted such a provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is COSLA asking for that could not be delivered by public entertainment licences? Mr. Russell, could you say more about your emphasis on the discretion of licensing boards? The theme of uniformity runs through the evidence that we have heard from other people; there is concern that if legislation were too discretionary, licensing boards and local authorities might not interpret it in precisely the same way throughout Scotland. There may be a conflict between the desire for uniformity on the one hand, and the understandable desire for local discretion on the other.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dan Russell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the first point in relation to the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 and the public entertainment licences that can be granted under the Act,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0684">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>63</span>
COSLA is perfectly happy with the provisions in those Acts and in that type of licensing, which applies to localities or premises which are not licensed in terms of the Licensing (Scotland) Act 1976. COSLA is asking that procedures under the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 which apply to premises which are not licensed for liquor also apply to liquor-licensed premises. COSLA argues that the legislation or licensing provisions of the 1982 Act which apply to one type of rave also apply to a rave which takes place in premises which are licensed under the 1976 Act. That, quite simply, is COSLA's attitude. It also has the advantage that the same types of conditions, the same procedures and the same standard conditions can be applied to both situations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of discretion for boards and ideal uniformity throughout Scotland, I think that the problem applies over a whole range of Acts and licensing provisions. Quite simply, you have to have discretion. Especially for raves, decisions have to be down to licensing boards in consultation with local police forces, both of which know the localities, the problems, the premises and the licence holders. They can attach the conditions appropriate for those premises. I suggest that the way to achieve uniformity is for guidelines to be issued. In other words, in a whole range of licensing situations, guidelines should come out from the Scottish Office or from other sources such as professional bodies, which recommend sets of guidelines. Those guidelines then exist, there are model conditions and it is up to the licensing board to apply the appropriate conditions to the specific premises.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are five people who want to ask a question, but we have only nine minutes, so questions will have to be short and answers as brief as possible if we are to get through everybody.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a quick question. You talked about appeals on the basis of licences; if the licence conditions were felt to be too stringent, holders could appeal to the sheriff. Has COSLA considered that the public might be carved out of it? Is there any way in which a right of appeal, because it is not strict enough, could be given to the public: one to the licensing board and two to the sheriff?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dan Russell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a different question because that point is not written into the Act. Obviously, if an application is made for the granting or renewal of a licence, objections can be received from a number of sources. If the application is for the granting of a licence, that is advertised and the general public have the chance to put in objections. When renewals come around, they are not advertised. Quite often, licence is renewed on the same terms and conditions and the general public do not know that the process is going on. It would really require an amendment to the Act to say that for renewal applications as well as for grants, the application should be advertised. That would be the way to do it. Whether it would be desirable is a political questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a former member of a licensing board, I am aware of the fact that the public do not hear about renewals. That causes much concern. Could I ask
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>64</span>
you to put something on the record? Were you saying it would be better to be able to design the conditions on a venue-by-venue basis if they were attached to the licence, rather than on a board basis, area by area? Would that lead you towards the idea suggested Crew 2000 that national guidelines or standards might be set by the Government but local specifications might be set based on each licence application?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dan Russell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike Watson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have two points, one of which has been made by my hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty). As I have not had the benefit of being a member of a local authority, can you tell me how long it takes to change byelaws? Am I right in thinking that local authorities cannot be flexible? I am attracted to COSLA's comments about making matters easier. Once a byelaw is introduced, it must apply uniformly within an authority. How, therefore, might licensing boards' venue-by-venue decisions change to reflect changing events? We have gone from dance halls to discotheques, to nightclubs and now to rave clubs— trends change. How will changes be reflected during the three-year period for which a licensing board grants a licence to a venue?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Davidson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Govan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to clarify whether COSLA's position was shared by all authorities or whether it was drawn from the submissions of only a few of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like Mr. Watson, I want to clarify the differences between byelaws and the licensing conditions that you have suggested. How quickly, for example, could the capacity of a club be reduced under the two types of proposals? What stages would we have to go through in each case?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dan Russell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will quickly answer the questions as best I can. Byelaws have to go through a particular procedure to be enacted in the first place. They have to be advertised and objections have to be invited. The board or authority then decides whether to make the byelaws. They are then referred to the Secretary of State, who might decide to hold an inquiry, depending on the number of objections, The byelaws are then confirmed. It can take nine months or longer for byelaws to come into force. The same procedure has to be followed to change byelaws. That means that once they are in place the same difficulties must be tackled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The byelaws would contain a set of conditions that could be applied to licences for venues where raves were likely to happen. All the conditions would apply uniformly to all premises. There would be no procedure for changing them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the COSLA proposal, conditions could be opposed to the grant at the time of grant or renewal of the licence. There would also be a provision to vary the terms of the licence during its currency. That would always be subject to the provision that due notice had to be given to the licence holder. There would be a further right of appeal if a condition was changed. There would be a procedure for varying the conditions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dan Russell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, there is still a case for guidelines, including model conditions, to be issued centrally.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Russell. That was extremely helpful. I am sure that your responses will be read with great care when the Committee starts its deliberations on the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>The witness withdrew.</i></p>
	<p>	<b>Submission by Ayr Pavilion</b></p>
	<p>As the committee will be aware, this company and some of its employees have unfortunately gained first hand knowledge of the problem which evidently exists nationwide, and we are grateful of any opportunity to contribute towards the provision of guidelines which, if are fully administered, will help to prevent further such tragedies.</p>
	<p>Over the past two weeks since receiving the Bill we have discussed the various implications and effects that the Bill will have on the licensing of events of this type. In general we feel that the Bill will be of value not only to Licensing Boards but also to the operators of legitimate and well run nightclubs/events. However the following points should be considered before it is passed:—
	<ol>
	<li>We are of the opinion that the use of the words "rave" or "raves" would be poorly advised as this is a term which lends itself to fashion and hence will most probably be outdated by the end of 1996. It is also a term which the media often use to ill-effect and may not deliver the desired responsible message to the youth of today/tomorrow.</li>
	<li>There is concern as to how Licensing Boards are expected to determine whether or not "it appears to the board that offences may be committed in relation to controlled drugs within the meaning of sections 2 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971" as quoted from Clause 1, subsection (3), paragraph (d). It is felt that Licensing Boards should be well advised before taking a decision on this basis.</li>
	<li>We are a little worried as to how the Bye-laws for each respective area may affect the implications of this Bill as we feel it is important that there is an element of uniformity throughout the country. It is also recognised that there is no form of appeal against:—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>the application of these Bye-laws; or</li>
	<li>the conditions imposed based on the information supplied by council officials, which can be subject to personal interpretation and hence is debatable.</li></ol>
</ol></p>
	<p>With the exception of the above we have no reservations about the Bill as it stands and in general we feel that it is going to be of help to Licensees in fighting the problems with which they are faced. It will also create acceptable guidelines for Licensing Boards to follow, as
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>66</span>
until now they have been asked to make tough decisions based on little or no idea as to the full extent of the problems which exist, or indeed why they exist. Licensing Boards should be careful not to penalise Licensees who are trying hard to keep drugs out of their premises, the battle should be against drug dealers and if we are to be successful we have to work together instead of against each other as has been our experience so far.</p>
	<p>We hope that this evidence will assist the committee in their deliberations and if required we would be happy to send our Manager and our Health and Safety Advisor/Paramedic to make oral submissions regarding the Bill and the knowledge they have gained whilst working in this industry.</p>
	<p>Mrs. Christine MacIntyre, Managing Director; Mr. Fraser MacIntyre, Manager; Mr. Geoff Young, Glasgow-based paramedic, 	<i>called in and examined.</i></p>

I am a licensee of many years—I ran a dance hall for 22 years prior to a drug invasion. I feel that I am a victim of tragic circumstances. On my right hand is my son, Fraser MacIntyre, who is helping me to run the dance hall. On my left is Geoff Young, a paramedic whom we brought in and who worked with us for seven months while we were trading under appeal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did you find that in the main, the findings of the hearing that was held on Hanger 13 came out very much in support of the steps that had been taken by the management, perhaps latterly with respect to controlling the situation that you faced in organising not raves but simply young people's dances?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Christine MacIntyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I always argued with the word "rave" because we were running a techno-dance night, and we were not going through the night as it appeared in the media. The fatal accident inquiry cleared up some points—for example, the way in which the media had spread the rumour that there was no water available, which was an untruth. There was always freely available water, although the majority of your youngsters preferred to buy the plastic bottle with a cap on it which they could fill up later. So the fatal accident inquiry did help to correct some people's thoughts. So much time has passed and it is more apparent to people that this drug culture is not now just in one form of event but is creeping into all parts of society.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I asked what steps you had taken as a management. I think that some of those ideas will be incorporated eventually into the prepared guidelines. I should therefore like some idea of what steps your management took.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Christine MacIntyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We had always conducted a search of our patrons. Because of the knives and Operation Blade, I felt at the time that that was a valuable tool against the culture of everybody carrying a knife. Our searches were initially to stop weapons getting into premises but then we realised that we were beginning to find drugs as well as weapons, and the searches became more thorough to try to prevent that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware that Kyle and Carrick district council issued a public entertainment licence to you for future use and that the use of the premises was restricted to all kinds of dance events, with the exception of raves and similar events at which techno-music was played. That raises several issues. How advantageous would that situation be in your view? Could it be the case that whatever the licensing board produced in terms of prohibiting raves and techno-music, they could happen by another name?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Christine MacIntyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In our written submission we say that that is definitely—or probably—a possibility. We feel that the word "rave" is a fashionable term, and fashion changes regularly. For the purposes of the Bill, we felt that it was ill-advised to use that word.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What you are saying about the public entertainment licence—I am putting this to you for the sake of clarity and not in any critical way—would make clause 1 redundant because other types of entertainment would take place with the same dangers that existed in the past. Am I correct?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser MacIntyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are you referring to the current licence?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the draft one that you will implement when conditions are appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser MacIntyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We felt that the restrictions that had been placed on that licence did not help because, as you say, different events could be held under different names. We were definitely of the opinion that conditions should be imposed which helped to create a safe venue for whatever type of music or entertainment provided. The prohibition of raves, techno music or whatever else can often lead to problems of use in our society. In terms of rebellion, if it happens in licensed premises with conditions in place to help make those premises safe, it must be better than in private houses, warehouses or wherever else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the previous sitting, COSLA expressed criticisms of byelaw procedures. You, Mrs. MacIntyre, in paragraph 3 of your written submission, express your worries and concerns about byelaws— though not necessarily the same worries and concerns as COSLA. Would you like to take this opportunity to expand on your reservations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Christine MacIntyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I found when we were trying to negotiate with our district council or licensing board that we came up against the problem of numbers. At one stage it was suggested that we should have 50 people on the balcony. My legal representative asked which corner of the balcony, which may have sounded a bit cheeky but the balcony could take more than 300 people. There is no appeal if you cannot come to an agreement with your licensing board. Its decision cannot be appealed against. You can appeal against it only if it has not voted in public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There should be some form of arbiter if agreements cannot be reached. An architect, for example, said that a building could take X number of people, so one of my main points is that there should be some form of arbitration or appeal system when there is no agreement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>68</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What were the main practical problems facing those who run raves or rave-type events? Do you consider an appeal system to be extremely important?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser MacIntyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In answer to your second question, the option or opportunity to appeal is very important. As we have stated in paragraph 3, conditions that may be imposed by any board or council are based on information supplied by council officials. As my mother pointed out, such information can often be debatable and subject to personal interpretation. Some form of appeal, then, is very important in view of some of the conditions that might be imposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Problems faced by licensees in organising this type of event include the drug element. Youngsters now seem to be turning to drugs. We should not assume that the problem happens only at one type of event; drug problems are more widespread in society. People take drugs at discos and public houses, not just at rave events, so we are faced with the problem of trying to keep drugs out of the premises. People coming into the premises can still have consumed tablets or whatever outwith the premises and in that instance we have to provide a safe venue for them. If things should happen, we have to provide paramedics, closed circuit television, stewarding, first aiders and all sorts of things like that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I do not know whether you have had a chance to read their evidence. Were you attracted to COSLA's approach of using the Civil Government (Scotland) Act 1992 premises by premises and of negotiating flexibility based on a set of national guidelines?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser MacIntyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We feel that it will be of help because if the Government or the Scottish Office provide a set of model conditions, it may then be up to each local board to apply those conditions as it sees fit, according to the venues that it is applying them to. That would certainly be a better form of legislation. However, we are sometimes worried because, as you may know, we have a potential licence under the 1982 Act which imposes all sorts of conditions that we felt at the time were unhelpful to what we are all trying to achieve. We felt that trying to get conditions that suited all of us was becoming more and more like a game of tennis with the board. We were fighting against each other instead of working with each other to prevent the problems that we were all having.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The COSLA representative explained that if it were on a licence-by-licence basis, a licence could be amended by a quicker and more public procedure, whereas an area-by-area basis involves nine months to bring in the byelaw and then nine months to amend it. Which is the more attractive to you?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser MacIntyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is tricky. From a personal point of view, it would be better to have a set of moral conditions that councils or boards can select and apply accordingly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Licence by licence?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser MacIntyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There should be a set of moral conditions for the nation, but as Mr. Russell of COSLA said, each venue and each area varies, sometimes quite dramatically. We feel that it is important that there is some form of uniformity in applying the conditions. But if there is a right of appeal, that would probably be the preferred option. However, it is difficult for all boards to be able to keep in touch, not only with what is going on in the local council, but throughout the rest of the nation. I think that is where uniformity comes in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the great difficulties evident, particularly initially, at Hanger 13 was stewarding. What help in regard to the recruitment and knowledgeability of stewards could guidelines give to managements of such venues in the future?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geoff Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can I pick up on that one? The stewarding at Hanger 13 is probably the best in Scotland. I say that with the experience of 167 dance events over the past 15 months.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Latterly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geoff Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Since September 1994, when I first became involved in dance events. The stewards at Hanger 13 were all trained in first aid and worked closely with management, myself and the paramedics we had in place during the 50 or 60 dance events that we did at Hanger 13. Would that the situation was the same in every venue. Sadly, it is not. There were occasions when stewards could be accused of being a little heavy handed. I can think of more occasions in other venues when stewards were downright brutal with people whom they believed had illicit drugs or weapons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a form of training for stewards. I understand that one of the colleges offers a certificate in stewarding and they proudly wear the tie, which is the insignia of office. Personal communications would be useful, because, as somebody mentioned earlier, they are frequently chosen for brawn as opposed to brain. But that is only a small part of the problem. Stewards can be handled, the kids can be handled: the problem is bigger; it is the whole thing about dance events and raves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Newspapers focused on the drug taking at Hanger 13 rather than on the problems of numbers and stewarding at the venue, to which the hon. Member for Ayr referred. I have looked at newspaper reports. The report of the fatal accident inquiry mentioned that
	<br><blockquote><p>"officers had taken the names and addresses of 1,230 patrons leaving Hanger 13 in the early hours of August 21."</p></blockquote>
It has been suggested elsewhere that 1,000 is the maximum number for those premises. That creates in the public's mind the feeling that too many people were allowed in and scrutiny of individuals with regard to drug taking was not as vigilant as it could have been simply because of the numbers present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report of the fatal accident inquiry also mentioned that after the event on 21 August, 14 people had been reported to the procurator fiscal. The age profile of patrons shows that there were two people aged 13 years, three 14-year-olds and 31 people 15 years of age. That arouses concern in the public's mind. I want you to focus on the issue of numbers. Is not there a case for reducing
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>70</span>
the number of people so that space is available for stewards and others to ensure that drug taking and peddling is limited and that only people over 18 are allowed in?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of us are not convinced about the quality and standard of stewarding generally. Is there not a case for working with local police so that the people you employ as stewards have their approval?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser MacIntyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly, we feel that it is very important that we work with the local police. In the 22 years that my mother has run the Pavilion there has always been a great deal of co-operation between the two bodies: the police and my mother and the staff. In the latter stages of Hanger 13 we felt that that had been totally broken up and I do not think that it helped anybody to achieve his goal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On a number of occasions we asked the police for assistance by way of vetting staff and possibly supplying two patrolmen or constables to be in the vicinity during the hours of operation. We were told on every occasion that both of those aspects were practically impossible. They are not allowed to give out information on individuals and their previous records. Secondly, we thought that there would be a conflict as to the nature of the police officer's duties. Would funds be provided by ourselves for them to be available on the night? It is important for us to work with the police so that we can vet staff in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How, with the help of identity cards, could you address the point raised by the hon. Member for Dumbarton about young people who attend?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser MacIntyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am getting embroiled in something else here. I feel that identity cards would be of great assistance and value to licensees throughout the country. Various schemes are now available, but none of them is mandatory and none of them helps licensees to perform their tasks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are permitted to reopen—we intend to approach the licensing board in the not too distant future— we would like to be able to provide a safe venue and take on some of the model conditions that the Bill might support. One of the conditions that we will impose is a membership scheme whereby all members have to have a card. We will store an image of each member on computer, and a form of identification—be it a passport or a birth certificate—will be taken by us to prove the age of persons who attend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Devlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did your hear the sheriff's evidence earlier?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser MacIntyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Devlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And did you agree with his recommendations that we should examine conditions across the board? He called on Parliament to introduce guidelines in legislative form. Do you agree with that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser MacIntyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said earlier, I feel that there should be a set of model conditions somewhere in the legislation. However, as Mr. Russell from COSLA

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>71</span>
said, it is important for local boards to be able to apply them according to the conditions and problems that exist in their areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Devlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In your submission, and twice again today, you have emphasised that the conditions should be universal in Scotland, if not further afield. Why do you put such heavy emphasis on that approach?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser MacIntyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I feel that the ideal way to combat the problem that we all face would be to have a body that combined the experience of some of the people sitting here, people from drug counselling agencies, paramedics at dance events, the police and someone from the licensing board. It would be ideal to have a committee that could look at the different venues that are trying to run those events. That way there would be uniformity throughout and the committee would know that it was applying me correct conditions to venues. At the moment, it is difficult to ask a licensing board to apply conditions when they sometimes know little about the nature of those events. That is asking them to carry out mission impossible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Devlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Finally, if the local licensing authority in Ayr put strict conditions on your operation, where is the nearest location at which such an event could take place?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser MacIntyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are events everywhere. A club in Saltcoats—not mentioning any names—had a similar problem to ourselves. That was not so well documented by the press. The problem does not exist solely in Kyle and Carrick or the new South Ayrshire council. You have only to drive 20 minutes up the road to encounter the same problems. Some people want to go to these events throughout Scotland and the UK—not just in Ayr.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Devlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we put in place a strict licensing scheme throughout Scotland, how long will it take before the youngsters would would have attended Hanger 13 get to England?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geoff Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are already going to England. In the same way that people came to Hanger 13 from Elgin, Inverness, Northern Ireland, Manchester and Liverpool on a regular basis, Scottish kids are going south. The nearest venue, Saltcoats, is six or seven miles away—within 10 or 15 miles at most. These events take place on Friday, Saturday and Sunday throughout the whole of Scotland and England. We have a team that goes up to Elgin every Friday night. There are similar events in Aberdeen and elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Personally, I believe that there should be uniformity across Scotland. We cannot have cowboy licensing boards: One or two of them are already imposing very strict regulations. That means only that dance events do not take place in their area, so the kids have an extra 10 minutes bus ride or whatever. People will go to dance events wherever they are.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>72</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Devlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you for putting that on the record. There are large rave parties in Stockton-on-Tees where I live and I know that people travel down from as far away as Edinburgh and Glasgow and up from Doncaster and further south. So I take that point entirely. I wanted you to put that on record so that the Committee could give it serious consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Irene Adams 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Paisley, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I press you a little on stewarding? I am not so convinced that stewards are only a small part of the problem. How did you set about employing stewards? Were they directly employed, contracted in, or what? What improvements could we make? Stewards often set the tone of the whole place, so we should be careful how we employ them. What can we do to help you employ the right sort of people? Who polices the stewards? How could we find that out?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser MacIntyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I have already said, we feel that it is important to vet all the staff whom we would like to employ. We have always tried to do so by whatever means are available to us. The ideal situation is to have people working for the premises, as that allows having local stewards working regularly. That is better than having a firm that cannot guarantee the same stewards every week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The training programmes offered at various colleges have not always provided experience in relevant areas— definitely not hands-on experience. A steward needs to be experienced if he is to understand all the problems. So we definitely need somehow to vet employees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Adams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Were you able to do that in the past, or was it a case of contracting in a firm of stewards with no knowledge provided about who was employed or no character references? How do you envisage that being changed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser MacIntyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the past we tried employing stewards whom we already had. As I said, we do not like using stewarding agencies because there is no guarantee of quality people. It is important to have uniformity throughout the club and throughout club nights. The only way to achieve something in the future is to have some form of vetting or co-operation with the police to make sure that we get stewards of a suitable nature.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a small supplementary question on what you said before Mrs. Adams asked you some questions. You talked about uniformity, which you seem to be hung up on, but you do not know whether to come down on its side. Your answers have been very political and you have not given us a straight one. It is uniformity versus individual vetting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously you have experience of the negotiations that you talked about. Would you agree with the young people of Crew 2000 and Enhance who gave us evidence yesterday that there should be some sort of local advisory committee? That would not necessarily be part of the licensing board, but could include people from the youth culture who could give sensible advice to help these arbitrations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser MacIntyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that is what I was trying to imply earlier on. I feel that it would be better for licensing boards to be able to turn to people with the necessary experience in the relevant areas.

As I said licensing boards are faced with mission impossible in trying to determine whether or not they are applying the correct conditions for each venue in sometimes very different circumstances. If there was an advisory committee made up of representatives who have knowledge and experience of the scene and the industry, it might just help licensing boards to be able to say, "What do you feel about a chill-out area for this particular venue and for the type of music that they are playing on a Saturday night?" The committee would then be able to say that it did not feel that to be necessary in this instance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not that lead you to the conclusion that you have not yet reached—that it must be licence by licence? Only in that way do we get a venue-by-venue decision, whereas with a system of byelaws, there are strict byelaws for one area and less strict ones for another.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser MacIntyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it probably does have to be dealt with licence by licence; there is nothing the same about two individual venues. But I feel that there could be some uniform set of guidelines for the people on the boards to be able to decide licence by licence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you. Obviously, the benefits of your experience have been passed on to members of the Committee.

	<p>	<b>Letter from Dr. Leo Murray, The Ayr Hospital</b></p>
	<p>I have studied the wording of the Bill and this would seem merely to allow Licensing authorities to impose conditions. It would seem to be my place to suggest which conditions might be imposed.</p>
	<p>The particular drug Ecstasy is very unpredictable in its effects and we don't really understand how it causes death in a few unfortunate cases. There does seem however to be an association between over exercise, overheating and dehydration and the occasional fatal effects. The conditions imposed should be designed to minimise these preventable factors.</p>
	<p>Because of my unfortunate involvement with the deaths of 3 young people from Ecstasy I have been consulted by various people and organisations in this regard although I am in no way an expect on the subject.</p>
	<p>I attach to this letter a copy of guidelines for good practice at dance events which originated from a Lee Fawcett at the Scottish Drugs Forum.</p>
	<p>I think this summarises well the problem and the desirable organisational features at the well run raves. I don't think I can do better.</p>
	<p>Dr. Leo Murray, the Ayr hospital, 	<i>called in and examined.</i></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>74</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On behalf of the Committee, I welcome you, Dr. Murray. Having sat through some of our proceedings, you will have seen the format of our evidence taking. If you wish, you may make a short statement to forestall some of our questions or to help us to ask the right questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Leo Murray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will just take questions from the floor and see where that takes us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Watson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I note from your submissions that you are reluctant to be cast in the role of an expert. I understand why you decline that tag. We heard evidence yesterday from an organisation that deals with the addicts who are coming off drugs. They regarded the Bill as a charter to make going to raves and taking ecstasy acceptable. Is that your view? How dangerous is ecstasy when taken on its own? What, in your experience, is the preponderance of diluted ecstasy tablets? An article in 	<i>The Guardian</i> on Friday said that very few tablets sold as ecstasy were pure MDMA and many different substances are added to them. What affect does that have on people taking the tablets? What is the effect of mixing ecstasy— or what people believe to be ecstasy—with other drugs?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Leo Murray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are several questions there. I shall try to take them in a sensible order. First of all, you asked me whether the purpose of the Bill was to legitimise or to make acceptable the use of ecstasy. I think we have to accept that that is what it is about. The Bill, which I have read, merely empowers licensing authorities to impose conditions on rave venues. The reason why we are imposing those conditions is not that people are dancing or consuming alcohol, but that we accept that, in a large number of those venues, people will be consuming ecstasy. The Bill represents an acceptance that ecstasy use is there, that it will stay there, and that we shall control it. It is an attempt to make that use safe. The Bill, by definition, accepts ecstasy use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You asked me how dangerous ecstasy is, and mentioned that I have declined to be an expert. As I said in my preamble, I came to Ayr to be a consultant in accident and emergency medicine. Although I am obviously aware of the problems with recreational drugs, I did not expect, when I came to a provincial town, to have three young people die on my hands from taking this drug. That concentrates your mind. I have read round the subject and thought about it. I have been provoked to do so by people asking me questions because I happened to be here. I am not an expert, but I have thought about the subject and read round it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had the advantage of being in Ayr, where—until recently, when Hanger 13 was shut down—there was quite a lot of ecstasy use. There were raves there; and there were also organised raves based at Prestwick airport and at Patna shooting grounds outside Ayr. On the evenings of those big raves in particular, I was seeing 10 to 15 people every evening—in the small hours, unfortunately—intoxicated with ecstasy. They were usually not critically ill—they were intoxicated rather than ill—but in that context I saw three young people who died.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0690">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>75</span>
On one of those evenings, I went out with the ambulance crew to Prestwick airport to see one of these raves in progress at 3 o'clock in the morning. Some of you will be familiar with Prestwick airport; it has a huge concourse area which was jam packed with young people. There was a deafening din from the music. As I wandered around and pushed my way past people, it was obvious to me that the majority of people were intoxicated, probably with ecstasy. There were a lot of dilated pupils around me as I watched.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There were thousands of people there, and there must have been thousands of people taking ecstasy that evening. We know that thousands and thousands of people take ecstasy on a regular or sporadic basis. They do not all die. The deaths that we see are particularly shocking, because they are the deaths of fit, young people. Somebody's daughter or son has gone out for a night and has become a figure in the newspapers. It is shocking, but looked at in statistical terms, ecstasy is not a dangerous drug. What is frightening and dangerous about it is that people who die from it die unpredictably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that alcohol causes problems, but it is largely dose related. If you have a few drinks, you are not going to kill yourself. If you drink to excess, you might kill yourself, or you might kill someone else. It is as if taking one glass of whisky might, in one person in every few thousand, result in sudden and unexplained death.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That message about danger is particularly difficult to get across to the young people who use ecstasy because they know that they have used it safely before; they know that they have been in rave venues where all those people have used it safely; and they know that thousands— or, probably, hundreds of thousands—of people have used it safely. So that you might be the one person who dies from it is a very difficult concept to grasp.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I am trying to explain the risks and the dangers to people, I try to draw an analogy with an allergy to prescription drugs. As a doctor, if I give you penicillin for your sore throat, I do not expect to kill you; but I know that, statistically, we killed five people with penicillin in the United Kingdom the last year for which we have figures. The fact that drugs can have unpredictable and fatal side-effects is not a novelty to doctors, but is a difficult concept to get across to the public. That is a rather long answer to how dangerous it is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Watson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just a brief attempt at reiterating a couple of points: one, the fact that it is often diluted or mixed with chemical cousins; the other, the preponderance of mixing ecstasy at the event you attended with other drugs. What evidence is there of that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Leo Murray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a difficult question to answer because it cannot be answered without doing a lot of analysis on lots of drugs. I have not done that and I do not think that anyone else has done it in a systematic fashion. But you will be familiar with the fact that with recent deaths, some people have stood up and said ecstasy is very safe and that the deaths were due to what is colloquially known as bad E—contaminated, mixed or adulterated ecstasy. In the cases that have gone through a forensic toxicology laboratory to be analysed properly, my understanding is that the drug has been ecstasy. I am
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>76</span>
a propagandist as a public health doctor and an A & E doctor, and it clears the pitch and clouds the issue if people think that the problem is bad E and that if only they take good E, they will be all right. As a propagandist, I try to avoid answering that question. But for a scientific answer, the drugs would have to be analysed. To my knowledge, that detailed information is not available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that at these venues some people are using multiple drugs. It is surprising how little alcohol is consumed at large raves. Some young people, as you may know, are anti-alcohol. It is unfashionable in some groups. Some do not use alcohol, but use ecstasy. I see people who use ecstasy with alcohol and I see people who use anything they can get their hands on.. They may be taking ecstasy with alcohol, what they think is an amphetamine, or other prescription drugs—temazepam, diazepam and anti-depressants. I see the spectrum. The average raver goes along and takes his ecstasy, possibly with alcohol, but I do not think that the polypharmacy is widespread.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We heard Sheriff Neil Gow say earlier that sometimes those who have taken ecstasy come out and in order to cool down take temazepam. Have you come across much evidence of that and of a concoction of different drugs being taken in the same evening? How do you assess the danger or threat to life in those circumstances?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Leo Murray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am familiar with people taking uppers and downers, that is how it is described. In my experience, having talked to the young people I see in my department, I do not think that it is a major phenomenon. Ecstasy has a duration of action—its clinical effects or psychological effects are relatively limited over a matter of hours. People who take it one evening have difficulty getting to sleep—they are a bit jumpy and wide awake and are usually dancing at that time. By the morning, they are tired, the drug is wearing off and the effect is going away. I do not think that the use of uppers and downers by the bulk of dancing young people is a major phenomenon. I have already alluded to the fact that there are people who use concoctions of recreational drugs of all sorts at one end of the spectrum. They are more likely to be taking sedative with their ecstasy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When it comes to working out the dangers of the drug—and the danger of ecstasy is very unpredictable and not fully understood—taking it with temazepam, diazepam or another sedative would not add to the danger. But it adds to the difficulty of assessment, and not only for doctors. I heard you talking about stewarding, and asking stewards to try to identify people whom they consider to be a risk to themselves, by looking around the dance hall and trying to see which people are not happy, are not having a good time and who may be at risk and who, perhaps, should be got off the dance floor and helped. Clearly, people who are using other drugs present a problem because they will be sedated, staggering, unsteady and not happily dancing and jumping around. I do not know if that is an adequate answer to your question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given your comments about the effects of the Bill and the recognition of ecstasy, do you agree that one of the Bill's aims is to keep ecstasy out of dance

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>77</span>
halls? If that is achieved, given what you said about the duration of the effects of ecstasy, the Bill could have a beneficial effect by reducing the amount of secondary drug-taking. In addition, could you tell us whether there has been a major change in the number of youngsters passing through the A and E department at Ayr hospital since the closure of Hanger 13? Perhaps you would expect that with the large numbers of youngsters coming into town at that time. Have you had any contact with your colleagues in the A and E department at Crosshouse? The Metro continued throughout that period, so I wonder whether they have seen any significant changes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Leo Murray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Since the closure of Hanger 13, there has been a reduction in the number of patients whom I have seen intoxicated with ecstasy. Hanger 13 acted as a magnet for young people from a large area, not in quite the same way as the very large, heavily-advertised venues did, but Hanger 13 was a magnet. I saw people from far afield, and some who died, who were not living in Ayr. Since the closure of Hanger 13, I still see people who are intoxicated with ecstasy. I have not had a fatality. For most people, ecstasy wears off, there are no effects and they are well the next day. Since Hanger 13 closed, I have been following two young people who have developed abnormalities which have shown up in liver function tests and other tests, indicating that they were at the end of the spectrum and might have come to grief. I see ecstasy intoxication in my department now on a weekly basis— an individual a week—rather than in batches of 10 or 15 in the early hours of the morning. I am very grateful for that. It is sporadic use. It is used not only in rave venues but by people in other settings. So there has been a reduction since Hanger 13 closed down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Talking to colleagues in other departments, not just in Crosshouse, there is continuing sporadic use. Nobody else is seeing the waves that I have seen from the organised venues in the area. So I think that the closure of Hanger 13 has reduced the problem in Ayr but, beyond that, I cannot say very much in detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question is the motivation behind the Bill and how the Bill would work—moving away from medicine and into politics and social comment, about which, of course, I have a view as an individual. I return to what I said earlier; the Bill is a piece of legislation at what I would call the safe sex end of drugs management. We are accepting that the problem exists; that we have to do some social engineering and introduce legislation that allows licensing authorities to impose conditions targeted at the use of a drug. The legislation accepts that the problem exists. Neither society nor this legislation will police ecstasy out of clubs because it is an extremely forceful drug. People take microgramme doses—tiny tablets, which are portable, easily taken, and can be taken before going into a venue. The legislation will not stop its use. It will make venues a safer place if people come to harm.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the controls prevent people who deal in tablets going into clubs, dealing and continuing the problem of ecstasy that way? I return again to the question of time limits and the fact that people may have taken the drug before they go into a club. What do you think about the time limits?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Leo Murray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, if by stewarding or policing one could identify individuals who are manifestly selling the drug, that would clearly reduce consumption. The drug,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>78</span>
when taken by mouth, will have an effect on an empty stomach within 30 minutes or an hour and one will peak within a matter of hours. To a certain extent it depends on what one has in one's stomach, how quickly one absorbs it and what the capsule or tablet is composed of. That means that people are still in a position to consume the drug before they go to one of the venues. It is not difficult to imagine how one might set oneself up as a dealer in the locality of a venue without having to go into one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You will be aware that the Scottish Affairs Select Committee examined drug abuse in 1994 and gauged the extent of the use of ecstasy in Scotland. It came up with the figure that 21.5 per cent. of 16 to 30-year-olds used it frequently; however, that figure was based on a small sample of only 200 people in five Scottish cities. The accuracy of extrapolating from the figure should be questioned. In your view, how extensive is drug-taking among young people in Scotland? Does the figure of 21.5 per cent. strike a chord?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You mentioned earlier the unpredictability of ecstasy. I have read several articles in the 	<i>British Medical Journal</i> which state that there is cause for concern in the irreversible brain damage could be prompted by the drug; it could cause certain nerve cells in the brain to lose their projections—they are called axons. Animal studies have been carried out recently in the United States which suggest that monkey or rat cells have been damaged abnormally by the drug; when they grew again after a 12 or 18-month period of abstinence, they were abnormal. What are your views on unpredictability, and the fact that one ecstasy tablet could cause irreversible brain damage? Your view is important to the wider issue of education about drugs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Leo Murray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have mentioned that ecstasy can unpredictably do one a lot of harm; you were suggesting a more dose-dependent effect on people's brains, which is something that I am aware of. You have to be honest with young people; scare stories will not work. One has to give them an accurate assessment of what you think are the facts. My assessment of the facts is that the notion that taking ecstasy will do permanent damage to an adult brain is scaremongering without foundation. There is cause for concern if one exposes a developing brain to ecstasy. Just as I would dissuade someone from taking alcohol in pregnancy, I would dissuade someone from taking ecstasy in pregnancy. All psychoactive drugs— although they are very different—work in similar ways in human beings. Our brains, which are very complex at a biochemical or microscopic level, are all remarkably similar. One cell talks to another cell by having little appendages bumping into one another which transmit chemicals across the gap. It is as simple as that. We think that drugs such as ecstasy, other amphetamines and LSD work by altering the way in which one little cell sends its messages across the small gap to the next little cell. In response to those messages, pathways and connections are built up which may affect how the brain responds in future. If you are exposing a developing brain to that, where pathways are being built up which are going to have an effect for the rest of your life, it may well be dangerous. I would say that it is scaremongering if we are trying to scare off adults, but pregnant people should not be exposed to the drug.

When it comes to the prevalence of drug use among young people, I think you quoted 21 per cent. using regularly. It is a difficult question to answer; for one thing, what does "regular" mean? I see young people and I talk to schools. There is no doubt that the use of recreational drugs lumped together—cannabis, ecstasy, LSD,—is a normal part of the behaviour of more than 50 per cent. of contemporary adolescents. In terms of experimentation, to say that 21 per cent. of young people use ecstasy regularly is an overestimate, if by that you mean that they make a point of going out every Saturday night and using ecstasy. But I would certainly give it as my opinion that the use of recreational drugs is a normal part of adolescent behaviour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a particular viewpoint on life. I see all the casualties—that is what I am there for. I do not see the people who get away with crossing the road, driving motor cars or taking recreational drugs. I see the people who go wrong. I see the tip of the iceberg, but I see 10-year-olds, 13-year-olds, 14-year-olds, 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds and recreational drug use is part of their normal behaviour. Here in Ayr there is another case involving ecstasy use that I am aware of. The young girl, who was only 16, came to some harm. I thought she might be one of the people who was going to die, but in the event she survived. During the investigation of that, a whole high school class was interviewed. Most of them were taking ecstasy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From a drug education point of view and a social point of view, drug use is normal adolescent behaviour now. It is what you might have regarded as cigarettes behind the bicycle shed or experimenting with alcohol. It is now use of the spectrum of recreational drugs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are three people who want to ask a question. We shall have to have shorter answers, because we have to finish by just before 25 minutes to one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Roseanna Cunningham 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Perth and Kinross)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have two questions on the medical side of harm reduction. First, I should like to ask about the provision of water and the effects of dehydration. Some recent cases which have attracted publicity have suggested that over-consumption of water can cause a great deal of physical harm to people who have taken ecstasy. What advice would you give to young people and to venue organisers about that? Secondly, what aspects of first aid training would be necessary to make a difference when young people became distressed or ill at such events? Not all aspects of first aid training would be particularly relevant to the effects of ecstasy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Leo Murray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the question of water first, we do not really understand why ecstasy makes some people die, but we do know that the people who die or who go badly wrong become overheated and dehydrated. It can be understood on a common-sense basis: if you have a disease that kills some people, a feature of which is overheating and dehydration, and they are jumping around in hot environments, then common sense would suggest that the prevention of dehydration is a good thing. I do
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>80</span>
not think it is any stronger than that, but that is the rationale for making drinking water freely available at venues where people are overheating, jumping around, sweating and taking drugs that increase their metabolic rate and might make them overheat. That is a good basic message to get across. Clubs should not be limiting access to water so that they can make a mark-up on bottled water.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When you are trying to get health and safety messages across, you have to keep them simple and not confuse people. It is unfortunate that the question of drinking too much water appeared in this recent case. If you are talking about treating people who are actually ill and who are suffering from the effects of the drug—people who are no longer in clear mind or in control of themselves—help should be sought, rather than attempts made to pour umpteen litres of water down that person's throat. I would make a distinction between preventive treatment by those running a rave and treating someone who is ill. It is important that the basic message about people not overheating, and cooling down by drinking if they are feeling overheated, is a good, safe message.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question about what first aid should be taught at these venues, it should be kept general, rather than specific. Just as we teach first aid for football matches, a rave venue is one where there are lots of people in a confined space, and the same basic first aid helps in a crisis. We talk about ABC management, the management of people's airways and of their breathing. We need to teach people that airway management is important; that you clear out people's mouths when they are choking and spluttering; and that you position them on their side if they are unconscious, so that they do not vomit and choke. If people have apparently stopped breathing, you breath for them using the basic first aid techniques. I do not think that we have to teach a new lot of first aid to deal with ecstasy. People are going to have fits, collapse or fall down stairs—all these tilings will happen in dance venues as well as ecstasy use.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Devlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You said earlier that, in the Bill, we should try to make such places safer for when people come to harm, and you said that you had accompanied an ambulance to the airport to see the situation there. Were you struck by any immediate recommendations as to how we could have made that a safer place? Are there any other recommendations that you would like to make?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Leo Murray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The single most important thing that you can do to make a place safer is to recognise that people in that venue might be coming to harm. While I understand the policing concept or the "grab the dealers" concept, from the health professional's point of view the important thing is that the stewards or supervisors in that venue have their eyes open and are noticing when people are in a bad way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is easier said than done, because one of the attractions of these venues is that there are a lot of bodies close together. People are jumping around, and strobe lights and artificial smoke and carbon dioxide are being used, so it is difficult to supervise people. But the single most important thing is to be aware that people in your venue might go wrong, and to ensure that people are keeping their eyes open and are summoning help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At some recent venues—one can imagine the hysteria in the air—we have had ambulances standing by at the door. We do not need that. We have an ambulance service
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0693">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>81</span>
that is able to respond quickly in urban areas if it is called upon. We do not need people standing at the door ready for problems, but we need an awareness on the part of organisers that they should be keeping their eyes open.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the tiniest of questions.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Leo Murray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The brief answer to that is no.

	<p>	<b>Submission by the Bridge Project, Ayr</b></p>
	<p>At the request of the local MP Mr. P. Gallie, I am writing in my capacity as addiction worker with the Bridge Project (Ayr) to support the amendment to the Licensing (Scotland) Bill. I feel that the introduction of this bill is extremely important, in order to safeguard the health and safety of young people attending dance events.</p>
	<p>Until the closure of Hanger 13 last year, my colleague and I undertook detached drugs work in the venue on a regular basis.</p>
	<p>This basically consisted of being present on 'club' nights and giving out drugs information and advice to young people. The literature distributed tended to be of a 'harm reduction' nature. As well as warning about the dangers associated with drug taking, it also gave practical advice for those who had chosen to use illicit substances. For example, a leaflet on Ecstasy would include information on the best ways to avoid dehydration, i.e. wear loose clothing, drink approximately one pint of water per hour and take plenty of 'rest' breaks.</p>
	<p>This information was very well received by young people in the club and a large number took the opportunity to discuss drug related issues in some detail, with my colleague and I.</p>
	<p>As a result some young people began attending the Bridge Project for counselling and the overall level of 16–20 year olds looking for information/advice has increased significantly.</p>
	<p>As a drugs worker, I have found that working at Hanger 13 and other local pubs/clubs, has been an invaluable way of getting information across to 'recreational' drug users who do not traditionally attend drug agencies.</p>
	<p>I believe that the free availability of 'harm reduction' literature at dance events, should be given serious consideration when drawing up the specifics of the Bill.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>82</span>
The reason that I am stressing the importance of this point, is that in my experience as a drugs worker the majority of young people have already taken their drug of choice before entering the venue and thus must be equipped with accurate information should problems arise.</p>
	<p>Recently there has been a lot of emphasis and responsibility placed on the provision of adequate stewarding and searching of clientele when entering clubs. Although I acknowledge that this is an essential service, which must be included in the Bill, the Bill's limitation in stopping drugs entering the venue must be recognised.</p>
	<p>In my experience the potential for problems to develop is due predominantly to overheating and dehydration. It is therefore vital that a number of conditions are imposed in order to combat this situation.</p>
	<p>I have enclosed a copy of a recent publication by the Scottish Drugs Forum, "Guidelines for Good Practice and Dance Events". I believe that the Committee will find all the necessary conditions for 'Safer' dance events are outlined in this excellent document, they include:—
	<ol>
	<li>Prevention of overcrowding;</li>
	<li>Adequate air conditioning and ventilation;</li>
	<li>Availability of free water;</li>
	<li>Provision of chill out/rest areas;</li>
	<li>Adequate stewarding/training of staff;</li>
	<li>Security checks;</li>
	<li>Drugs information.</li></ol></p>
	<p>However, I feel that it is important to state that when considering the amendment to the Licensing (Scotland) Bill, it must be recognised that the use of drugs such as ecstasy, amphetamines and temazepam is not only confined to events known as 'raves'. In my experience of detached drug work, I have found that these drugs are used within various types of pubs/clubs which play many different types of music.</p>
	<p>I therefore believe that it is important that the conditions that have been outlined above are not applied solely to rave/techno music events, but are put into practice in all disco/nightclubs catering for young people.</p>
	<p>I hope that this submission has been of some help to the Committee, should you require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact the office.</p>
	<p>Ms Claire McCartney, Depute Project Leader and Ms Eileen McCrindle, Detached Worker, 	<i>called in and examined.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is helpful if you put your names in front of you because I cannot see them from here, with or without my glasses. I welcome you to the Committee. You have seen the format and understand what is going on. For the record, will you introduce yourselves please, so that we know who you are.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise that the E-team and the young people involved with the project did much good work at Hanger 13 on the drugs issue. Can you tell me whether the closure of Hanger 13 cut off an avenue of contact between your group and the young people who are probably still taking ecstasy, as we heard in previous evidence?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0694">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>83</span>
Secondly, what was your objective when you operated in Hanger 13? Was it to try to discourage people from taking drugs, or was it simply to make them aware of the health risks and ensure their safety while taking drugs?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Claire McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, yes, I think it has. When we worked at Hanger 13, it tended to be on a Saturday night or with under 18s on Friday night. We found that, as an agency, we received a lot more referrals of people of that age group who were having problems with ecstasy, and who traditionally would not come to a drugs agency, which they see as being for junkies. They see themselves as recreational drug users who do not need help. Through being a presence at the club, we made ourselves available to young people who realised that they could speak to us and could use the agency. As a result, we have had people calling for counselling. Also, just the level of advice and information given out to people who dropped in at the agency increased when Hanger 13 was open. A lot of young people are still coming in, but I think that is a hangover from that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On your second question, about the kind of information that we were giving out when we were working with under 18s, it was fundamentally preventive. We were telling people about the dangers and that, ultimately, there is no safe way to take a drug; there are always consequences. But when we were working in the clubs on a Saturday night, it tended to be a matter of harm reduction. Whatever we like to think, people are taking drugs. Through the E-team, we have very recently done a survey of 14 to 18 year olds. As Mr. McFall said earlier, 23 per cent. of the people in that survey had tried ecstasy. They were not using it on a regular basis but they had tried it. Those were 14 to 18-year-olds, yet Mr. McFall said that people up to 30 take ecstasy. So there are a lot of people using drugs. Just with recreational drugs, 83 per cent. of young females and 70 per cent. of young males had tried drugs of some sort. We must recognise that. You have to do preventive work, but you also have to try and reduce the harm associated with the use of drugs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You said that there was a problem with the under-18s on Friday nights. However, raves were not run on Friday nights at Hanger 13; they had dance nights of a different description. Does that suggest that dances rather than "raves" are really the problem?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Claire McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The word "rave" is used widely to describe several things. For me, a rave is an event with over 1,000 people. Many discos round Ayr and in other areas play dance music, and drug use is associated with that; drug use is also associated with any type of music. Many venues in this town are pubs, where older men and women take amphetamines so that they can drink more; so that they can spend all day drinking, and then drink all night. It is important to recognise that the problem is not just with young people or with dance events.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Claire was talking about the number of young people. What she said is consistent with what I have heard from other people. You mentioned that Hanger 13 was closing and that the number of people coming to Ayr was drying up. In your submission you state:
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>84</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"it is important to state that when considering the amendment to the Licensing (Scotland) Bill, it must be recognised that the use of drugs such as ecstasy, amphetamines and temazepam is not only confined to events known as 'raves'."</p></blockquote>
Two words are defined in the Bill: "events", which is given a wide definition—perhaps that is not ideal—and "raves", which has an even wider definition that could as much apply to the "White Heather Club" as to Hanger 13. Do you think that those words should be defined more tightly? As you rightly say, drug-taking takes place away from raves. What would you advise the Committee to do?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Claire McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important to recognise, as I said before, that the problem happens in all clubs. I would go by the guidelines of the Scottish Drugs Forum. The problem is in all clubs; it is not associated just with dance music. It would be wrong to say that it just happens at dance events. I go to dance clubs myself, and drugs are readily available. Any venue, any nightclub—not just dance clubs—could be affected. I know that it is very difficult to define something, but it would be a grave mistake to try to narrow the problem down to dance events. That would put across the wrong message.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was going to ask whether you thought a definition should cover all the relevant events in which drug-taking might take place. Does counselling of young people who have engaged in drug-taking help? Is it effective? The young people concerned could be readily weaned from drugs. You recommended the guidelines of the Scottish Drugs Forum relating to good practice at dance events. The Scottish Office will give further guidance in due course. What would be helpful to you and to others who work in the area?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Claire McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I feel that clubs should be made open to drugs workers. Often clubs do not want that connection; they think that that indicates that drugs will be used in the club. A lot of our work is preventive. Clubs must recognise that. It should not be a flaw that a drugs worker is working in a club; it should be seen as a positive thing. There should be more openness for drugs workers in clubs, not after people have died but before that. It was mentioned earlier that deaths were associated with too little water. Water does not stop the bad effects of ecstasy. It only works to stop dehydration; that is what it is for. It is not for anything else. It does not take away the damaging effects of ecstasy. People should be in clubs to explain that. Drugs workers for the local community should be there on, for example, a monthly basis to talk to people directly. We worked there. Initially the young people were a wee bit anxious about it, but after the months went by we built up a really good relationship with young people. They would actually come to you and speak with you at the event and maybe say "Okay, I'll drop in and see you. I'm having some problems with it. The come-down is getting longer and I am having trouble sleeping during the week. I'm getting a bit depressed. Can I come and see you after the event?"</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On page two do your evidence you mention stewarding. Your probably were not present earlier when Sheriff Gow gave his evidence. We discussed the difficulties of stewarding. What is your
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0695">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>85</span>
impression of your people's reactions to physical searches at various venues, not just Hanger 13? We heard from representatives of Ayr Pavilion that they intended to gather more detailed information and hold it on computer. Do you think that young people would be happy to allow that? Do you think that it is a good development? When talking to young people about drugs, have you heard any objections on civil right grounds? Did they object to being searched because it interfered with their rights?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
COSLA believes that the Bill deals with the issue in the wrong way. It has given specific recommendations to amend existing legislation and allow local authorities to attach specific conditions to each licence. Would that be more helpful than the proposals in the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Claire McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I think that young people have become used to getting searched. Initially they were quite outraged, but if it means that venues will stay open and they can go to venues, they are willing to do that. I have been involved in searches. We are running dance events with the police in Govan recently. But as I said in my submission, there is no way that that could stop drugs getting into clubs. You can do your best. I have seen stewards doing their best. It takes a long time to get people into clubs if you are doing these searches—a very long time. The majority of young people we spoke to take drugs before they go to a club. I do not think that they really mind the searching. I think that they are used to it now. Initially, aye but not now. They are used to searches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On your second point, I do not know exactly what COSLA said. I have not read the submission, but I think there is something to be said for it. There are already licensing laws in force that could be used. Last year, Eileen and myself were down at a safer dance clubs conference in Manchester. The police and local authorities work in conjunction with the local clubs and they get a safer dance certificate to show that a club has passed. Things that are brought out here will not make any different categories of safer dancing. That is done on informal basis, not through a Bill through Parliament. According to the chief of police down there who was speaking at the conference, that works really well. I do not know how it would work up here, but I know that there it works well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Watson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested by one or two of the comments in your submission and your evidence today about widening the provisions beyond rave events. I take the point that Hanger 13 and similar venues are not the only places that we should be considering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is narrowly drawn. New section 38A(5) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"dancing' includes any movement apparently to the accompaniment of music; and</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>'music' includes sounds wholly or predominantly characterised by the emission of a succession of repetitive beats".</p></blockquote>
That applies to dance or techno music rather than rock and roll or rhythm and blues. Discotheques and night clubs might feature different types of music on different nights. There are difficulties in defining closely for a particular venue. Do you have any suggestions on that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You say in your submission that in your experience the potential for problems relates largely to overheating and dehydration. You are obviously addressing your comments specifically to that sort of dancing or event.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>86</span>
What experience have you had of other sorts of event? You said that you had been in clubs where drugs were available. What is your experience of that?

My third question, which I have asked other people who have given evidence, is about cocktails of drugs. Those are a feature, particularly in Glasgow, where I am based. I am aware that that is not necessarily the case in other parts of Scotland, far less in other parts of Britain. What is your experience of the mixing of ecstasy with other drugs, or of coming into contact with people who have taken a succession of different substances?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Claire McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, the legislation should apply to all clubs, not just dance clubs. On the question of how they should be defined, I think it should be the venues. I do not think it should be stuff like Friday night is dance night, and Thursday night is rock night. I think that these things should be available across the board, in all clubs. Everybody should be entitled to free water, not just those who take dance drugs.

In relation to what you said about dehydration, obviously ecstasy will raise your body temperature, but if you are dancing a lot—which is associated with dance events—that is when the majority of problems will develop. At a lot of the clubs, dancing is not such a major feature, and the dancing is not so hard core—rave dancing is hard-going and constant. Other music may have a stronger beat and is not so repetitive, so you do not need to dance as fast, and not as many problems develop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But I have seen people experiencing problems in other clubs, maybe not to such a degree but you might still see someone sweating a lot and have to take them aside and say that they should have a wee sit down. You need to get them water and talk the problem through with them if they are struggling a bit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Watson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was making the point that Ms McCartney's definition—her point about the succession of repetitive beats—applies to a specific type of music and not across the broader musical spectrum to other types of venue where people dance. I was asking her to clarify that point. As drafted, the Bill is fairly narrow on the musical aspects of its application.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Claire McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can you repeat the last part of the question?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Watson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The drugs cocktails—mixing E with other drugs. What is your experience—not personal— of that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Claire McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: After the deaths at Hanger 13, there was a reduction in the rate of young people using ecstasy. After speaking to a lot of young people, Eileen and I came to the opinion that they had got a bit of a fright. They were using things like amphetamine— sticking to speed rather than taking ecstasy. There were still some who used ecstasy, and I know that a lot of young people have combined ecstasy and speed.

There are many different definitions of ecstasy. They use the term "gouching" which means that they are falling

asleep and that there is no fizzing effect. The drug they have taken is not ecstasy, but that is the effect they are looking for from that drug. There are people who sit in the corner at a club and who do not like to dance that much—they just like the atmosphere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Claire McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I'll spell it— GOUCHING. To have a gouching. You should know that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not the way I spell it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I heard Dr. Murray saying that he finds that many people do not take things like temazepam to come off. In my experience it is not necessarily temazepam, but many people smoke a lot of cannibis. After they have been out, they go back home and sit and smoke a lot of cannabis. A number take temazepam to come down—that is my experience. I do not know how many end up in hospital with it because we do not tend to see them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Which drugs, apart from ecstasy, do you find that young people who come to you are taking?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Eileen McCrindle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are finding that the average age of drug users entering the Bridge project is about 18. Some young people coming in have experienced problems with ecstasy. We are also getting a lot of people coming in who have experienced problems with temazepam and prescribed drugs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Adams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do you find that some clubs and pubs— the usual venues where young people gather—are reluctant to bring in people like yourselves and the police if they encounter trouble because it might be a black mark against their licence? They might be penalised for bringing in groups, recognising that drug-taking is going on and calling in the police if there are difficulties, rather than being applauded for recognising those difficulties. Have you come across that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Eileen McCrindle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Claire said earlier that a lot of places are not very keen on getting in the likes of the Bridge project. Perhaps the owners feel that there is a problem. From our point of view it would be better if we were there to give out information and advice— ask anybody actually using drugs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
