<p>—[<i>Mr. R. Gibson.</i>]</p>
<p>Brought up, and read the First time.</p>
<p>11.3 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Gibson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, "That the Clause be read a Second time."<br><br>
The purpose of the Clause is to extend the authority for proclaiming intended marriage. Hon. Members will recall that, according to the present law of Scotland, proclamation of marriage banns may be made only in the Church of Scotland. But the Morison Committee felt that that was a slur on the other churches in Scotland, because ministers of other churches in Scotland had the right, at any time and in any place, to perform the marriage ceremony. They had that right in common with ministers of the Church of Scotland. That is the one concession that is made in the Report, but the Bill does not give effect to that concession. It was the first and foremost finding of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1596</span>
Morison Committee and, accordingly, it may well be taken as the consideration, or the price for the violent changes that are sought to be imported into the marriage law of Scotland by the Bill. It may be that the price is not a very big one; that it is in fact of the dimensions of thirty pieces of silver. Yet the Government are not prepared to pay even that miserable price for the great betrayal of the principle of the Scottish law of marriage which is contained in the Bill. That is a shocking state of affairs. I do not wish to recapitulate anything that I said at the last meeting, because what I said then is being pondered over in Scotland—and with very grave misgivings. The Tory Press, after our last meeting, was whimpering very loudly because the Government are again being found out in a betrayal of principle.<br><br>
In effect, this question of banns is a very small matter, and I cannot understand the Government not honouring this unanimous and foremost finding of the Morison Committee. If there is any virtue at all in banns, surely proclamation in the church where the parties are known is much more efficacious than proclamation in a church where neither of the parties is known. That is particularly the case in the large centres of population. Unfortunately, we have reached a stage when church-going is not so common as it used to be. Even at best, the proclamation of banns is not an effective method of bringing to the notice of the population of Scotland the fact that two residents in Scotland intend to contract marriage. But if there is virtue in banns, they ought to be proclaimed in the church where the parties are known. That conclusion is borne out by the facts with regard to bigamous marriages contracted in 1937. In that year 54 bigamous marriages were brought within the notice of the Courts, resulting in 58 persons being charged with bigamy. Of these 54 marriages, 25 were regular marriages performed by ministers of religion. Of these 25 marriages, 12 were preceded by proclamation of banns. Accordingly, the purpose of the proclamation of banns failed, in that it did not produce an objection to these persons being married on the ground that one or other was already married to somebody else, and so was not in a position to contract marriage according to the law of Scot-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0792">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1597</span>
land or any other Christian country, where monogamy is the rule.<br><br>
That being the position, the effectiveness of the banns would, in my submission, very clearly be increased if they were made applicable in the church to which one or other of the parties belonged, or with which they were connected. The proclamation would then be made in the presence of the people who knew the parties with some degree of intimacy. If the Government are not prepared to honour this foremost condition in the Morison report, they are striking a very serious blow at the whole principle of banns, and a very serious position will arise on the Report stage, because it may be necessary then to move to exclude banns altogether, as a pre-requisite of marriage in Scotland. Accordingly I move this Motion with very deep confidence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barr</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to take the liberty of explaining the position of the churches in regard to this subject. My hon. and learned Friend speaks of a betrayal, and of not getting even the full surrender value of 30 pieces of silver; but you never do get that, even if you have had a betrayal. If you count the pieces of silver in the representation on the walls of the Crypt you will find that there are only 20. I recognise that my hon. and learned Friend has made some points, in this new Clause, particularly in the proposal that churches should be authorised to make proclamations
<br><blockquote><p>"to members or adherents of their respective churches."</p></blockquote>
There is another point as my hon. and learned Friend has pointed out, in the fact that in the Church of Scotland the names are read out, of those who are, not only not members or adherents, but who, as he has implied, are not even known to anyone in the church. I would not go so far as he does in the interest of consistency, and urge the abolition of banns altogether; but I admit that if this Clause were carried you should bring the Church of Scotland into line, and say that proclamations by them should be confined to members and adherents of their own congregation. I will give the reason later why I do not propose to take that drastic action which my hon. and learned Friend has proposed. In one respect my hon. and learned Friend himself does not abide by the recommendations of the Depart-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1598</span>
mental Committee, but he makes a very real improvement on them. In page 16 the regulations which are to be framed by these churches are dealt with; and, for these churches, they are to be in accordance with the form laid down in the Act of Assembly of the Church of Scotland, 1932, and to have the like effect. It is evident that if you brought in these churches they would never be agreeable to their regulations being drawn up by the Church of Scotland. The proposal in the Clause is a real improvement.<br><br>
My next point is that to leave out any churches is to put them beyond the pale and there are more churches left out of this Clause than are put into it. First there is the Salvation Army, with 500 officers—I would call them ministers of religion. It is a large church—I call it a church—with a large number of members or adherents. Then there are the large numbers of the Brethren. If one looks at the "Glasgow Citizen" on a Saturday night, or at the "Glasgow Herald," one will see advertisements of various shades of Brethren. Then there are the churches of Christian Science, Spiritualism, the New Jerusalem, the Second Advent and the Four-Square Gospel. [An HON. MEMBER: "And the Jehovah Witness."] A very important omission is that of the Society of Friends. There is a whole Clause in the Bill dealing with the Society of Friends, and in the Second Reading Debate, I made some comments with regard to that; but my words were not directed to the question of their inclusion or exclusion in the matter of banns. My remarks were to the effect that in England, in 1872, the Society of Friends were given the right to celebrate the marriage of anyone who wished to demand it, even though neither of the parties was a Quaker, but that the Act of 1878 did not go so far for Scotland and the parties still had to be of the Quaker persuasion. The point is that in this matter they are excluded altogether. Speaking on the matter in another place, Lord Thankerton said that he could right there give the names of five important churches that were equally entitled with those mentioned, but were not included.<br><br>
I know that it has long been counted as a slur on other churches that this is confined to the Church of Scotland alone, but the most important question, I think, is whether the churches named here really want this privilege. It may be that some
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0793">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1599</span>
of them do, but some of them regard this old custom as a kind of disturbance of the spirit and atmosphere of worship. They have been accustomed to point to the Church of Scotland as having a State privilege in this matter, and they would be very slow to accept it for themselves, after the position they had taken up. I should like to refer to the report adopted by my own church with regard to the recommendations of the Departmental Committee. As my hon. and learned Friend said, the Departmental Committee put in the very forefront of their recommendations the recommendation that this privilege should be so extended. It is stated in the report that was unanimously adopted by the United Free Church Assembly:
<br><blockquote><p> "This is a move in the direction of religious equality, but is not Church proclamation as a means of publicity quite obsolete? Marriage, so far as the law is concerned, is a purely civil contract, and publication at the offices of the Registrar should suffice for all purposes. If greater publicity is desired, why not adopt the modern procedure of intimation in some public newspaper circulating in the district? If any person desires an intimation in Church, or any religious ceremony in connection with the marriage, that should be a matter for the Church and the parties to arrange, and a Minister should not act as a civil official in connection with the contract of marriage."</p></blockquote>
I am sure that view is not confined to that particular church, but extends to other churches as well. My hon. and learned Friend rather hinted this question: If that is our view, why not go further and withdraw banns altogether as published by the churches, or why not bring the Church of Scotland into line with the others? I referred to this in the Second Reading Debate, but I will refer again to my own attitude on that matter. While I do not approve of the Church of Scotland having State privileges, I do not follow the line of attacking it by pinpricks on matters such as this. If anyone were to ask me why I did not withdraw the right from the Church of Scotland, or at least establish complete religious equality, my main consideration would be that it would raise large sectarian issues and that the result would probably be that this Bill would be lost altogether. I have here a statement that, "Officialdom and ecclesiasticism are to have their grip strengthened" by this Measure. I do not look at the matter in that way, but that is a statement that was issued by the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1600</span>
London .Scottish Self-Government Committee. My devotion to and support of self-government grow in proportion as I see how it can survive the statements ' issued in its name.<br><br>
With regard to ecclesiasticism, I should, in dealing with the churches, say one thing. My hon. and learned Friend, in a previous discussion, warned us to beware of ministers, as they had a certain interest in the matter. I want to say in self-defence that, as far as marriages are concerned, I have never in my life taken a fee for a marriage. I believe it is common on this side of the Border, but it is altogether unknown on the other side of the Border. I do not think that ecclesiasticism figures greatly in Scotland. In the list in the new Clause, my hon. and learned Friend has put the Reformed Presbyterian Church of Scotland. It is characteristic of our Scottish position that, after the Resolution, for 18 years that church was without any minister, and it was 22 years without any sacrament, until the sacraments were dispensed, and the Covenant was taken at Auchen-sauch Hill. I think my hon. Friend the Member for Bothwell (Mr. Welsh) will agree with me in that matter. I want to say that, far from yielding to ecclesiasticism, this Bill, in the form in which it is at present, is a real advance. There has been ecclesiasticism in the past, and the civil powers have been guilty of it also by classing as irregular marriages, marriages that were perfectly lawful. It was a form of words that was very unfortunate. That is now to be removed by this Bill, and such marriages are to be valid and regular in all respects. Moreover, the Bill opens up civil marriages in all parts of Scotland with reasonable facilities, and that is in the directly opposite direction to ecclesiasticism.<br><br>
Therefore, while on grounds of certain religious equality I might get a list of names such as this and say that they are as entitled to it as the Church of Scotland, at the same time I do not think that is the way to get it; and if there were time, I should not be averse from discussing the whole question whether the privileges of the Church of Scotland should be conserved in this way; but I would rather not deal with that last question now, as I hope to see the Bill being passed in the form at which it is at present.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0794">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1601</span>
<p><span class='member'>Captain Ramsay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to draw attention to one feature in the list which we are asked to consider. Without going into the details of the case, I wish to make two comments. First, if this is to be a catholic list in the true sense of the word, that is to say, to include all religious denominations, I would like to know why the Mohammedan, Buddhist, Brahman, and Confucian Churches are left out, when the Jewish Church is included. My second comment is that it was laid down by Thomas Carlyle, who certainly was not prejudiced in favour of the Right, that any attempt to place Judas Iscariot and Jesus Christ on the same platform, would be bound to lead to confusion. I should like to recall that to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Lord Advocate (Mr. T. M. Cooper)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish that the hon. and learned Member for Greenock (Mr. Gibson) could have devised one Amendment to this Bill which I could have accepted in order that I might try out with him a policy of appeasement. I am sorry that on this occasion, as on previous occasions, I am obliged to resist his proposal, and I am not conscious, in doing so, of being guilty of any betrayal of principle. This is a practical proposal, and I shall endeavour to state briefly the reasons why I think it is a bad proposal which the Committee ought not to accept. A new Clause in identical terms was moved in another place, and after being resisted by several noble Lords, was withdrawn. When the Bill was receiving its Second Reading in the House, the question was raised again, and I dealt with it at length. I do not think the Committee would wish me to cover the ground again in detail.<br><br>
The angle of approach of the hon. and learned Member has been twofold. In the first place, he has reiterated the old arguments, and secondly, he has introduced one new argument. Dealing first with the old arguments, my submission is —and I think the speech of the hon. Member for Coatbridge (Mr. Barr) bears me out—that there is no question, as far as the existing law as regards banns or the proposed new Clause is concerned, of any slur upon any religious denomination. There is no question of giving any denominational privilege or ecclesiastical preference to the Church of Scotland. The system of proclamation of banns as a means of publicity is nothing else than one of several relics of an old historic
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1602</span>
method of giving publicity to public facts which is still maintained in relation to other things besides proposed marriages, such as diseases of animals, diseases of potatoes, and Schedule A Income Tax notices.<br><br>
I should be very sorry indeed to appear to give an opening to any controversy between various churches and denominations in Scotland, but I am bound to say I have a good deal of sympathy with the view that, as a method of publication, the publication of banns is a little bit obsolete, and for that reason, if for no other, I am a little surprised at anxiety being expressed from any quarter that this method should be more used than it is. After all, it belongs to the same theory of publication as that of which we have relics in Scots law, whereby requirements are made in old Statutes that certain facts are to be published from the Market Cross in Edinburgh, and from the pier and shore at Leith, and things of that kind. The publication of banns does nobody any harm. It is a thing to which obviously many people attach great sentimental value because I notice from the figures that the hon. and learned Gentleman got in answer to his question, that in 1937, out of a total of about 33,000 marriages, no less than 25,000 were preceded by proclamation of banns as against 7,600 by publication of notice. We have to accept the position that the people of Scotland obviously attach value to this method, obsolete and historical as it may be. The parish church is selected as the place of publication not because it is the institution of religion for the Church of Scotland but because it is the recognised historic, local, centre of each parish, and because it is, as far as I am aware, the only church in Scotland organised on a territorial basis. So much for the old arguments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Johnston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What about the English Church?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Lord Advocate</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not on the same completely territorial basis as the Church of Scotland. According to the theory of the Church of Scotland there is a parish church of one kind or another in every parish and in every registration district in Scotland and at least one church is designated in each parish for the purposes of the proclamation of banns. I think I am right in saying that in large cities there are some parish churches
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0795">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1603</span>
where banns are not proclaimed but in each registration district there is a recognised church for the proclamation of banns. May I now refer to the new point the hon. and learned Gentleman raised on his figures about bigamy?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barr</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I may confirm the Lord Advocate, there was a case at the last Assembly of a complaint by one church that they were not getting this recognition. Another complaint was that in one place the churches wished to take turn and turn about, and that was held to be illegal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Lord Advocate</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the hon. Gentleman. With regard to bigamy, I am not clear what conclusion the hon. and learned Member drew from the figures he gave. He said that in 1937 the total number of bigamous marriages was 54. We know that the total number of marriages contracted in 1937 was about 35,000, and that in that year the total number of married couples in Scotland by the census must have been about 880,000. If there were about 880,000 marriages where no bigamy had taken place, and only 54 where bigamy was detected, I should have thought the conclusion would have been that the system of publication was as nearly perfect as it was possible for any human institution to be. The hon. and learned Member did seem, by a method of reasoning that I have not followed, to deduce from that the argument that the system ought to be improved by the particular method he has selected in this New Clause.<br><br>
May I look at that method now from the severely practical point of view? The proposal in this Clause is to extend the practice of the publication of banns to 11 arbitrarily selected denominations. I em-phasise the words "arbitrarily selected," because, as I told the House on Second Reading, without going into the somewhat philosophic and the theological difficulties suggested by the hon. and gallant Member for South Midlothian (Captain Ramsay) as regards Eastern religions, there are at present in Scotland, so the Registrar-General informs me, no less than 80 recognised churches or denominations engaged, subject to suitable regulation, in the celebration of regular marriages. They include all those types of denominations, some of which were mentioned and which are probably only names to some of us, but which
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1604</span>
nevertheless satisfy the requirements of the law as having ministers and congregations in whose presence or by whom, a marriage may be celebrated. If this extension of proclamation by banns were justified as a proper thing to do, I could see no logical stopping-place short of expanding the Clause to include the whole 80, and the moment you do that, you introduce a state of complexity and confusion into the law which would go very far to undo the good work we are trying to do by simplifying and modernising the law of Scotland.<br><br>
The matter does not end there. The hon. and learned Gentleman proposes that the regulations to be observed, either by his ii Churches or by the 80, must be submitted to and approved by the Registrar-General. I do feel that it would be quite wrong for Parliament to impose on any official the extraordinarily difficult and delicate duty of attempting to prescribe ecclesiastical regulations for, let me say, the Roman Catholic Church. How is it to be done? I only single out the Roman Catholic Church as an instance. That is no task fairly to be imposed upon any member of the Civil Service and to attempt to do that would, I am confident, open the door to the most deplorable sectarian and religious controversy of all kinds. The Committee made another suggestion, equally bad, that the formula of the regulations should be approved by the Church of Scotland. Once again I have great difficulty in conceiving how the Church of Scotland, whether in General Assembly or elsewhere, could possibly propose to prescribe regulations to be observed by all these other denominations and religions. I am pointing to that merely as one of the difficulties of carrying this out. The last practical difficulty to which I think it necessary to refer is that we know, as regards a large number of these 80 denominations and I think I ftiay say also as regards some of the ii, that they have not places of worship in all parts of Scotland. Some of them have only one or two places of worship altogether. I came across one which had only regular place of worship in Edinburgh and one, I think, in Glasgow. What is the type of regulation that is contemplated? How is an adherent of one of these bodies to be defined? What is to happen when one of the two contracting parties to the marriage is a member of one denomination and the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0796">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1605</span>
other is a member of another denomination, or of none? It seems to me you would set a task, which the Registrar-General would find impossible, in trying to frame regulations, and I feel the proposal is impracticable. I am not going to pursue the matter.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Stirling and Falkirk (Mr. Westwood) has suggested the addition of the Salvation Army. That suggestion was made in another place, and then it was made plain, more or less on the lines adopted by the hon. Member for Coatbridge (Mr. Barr), that the Salvation Army only desired to be included if the others were being included Their attitude in this respect is, I believe, the attitude of a great many of the other denominations. My information so far as it goes is that there is no strong desire on the part of any of the denominations to get the so-called privilege, because they now recognise that this is not a matter of privilege at all but a matter of history and practical experience. Viewing the matter in that light, I hope the hon. and learned Member for Greenock (Mr. Gibson) on this occasion will see his way to break with his previous practice, and will not press this Motion to a Division.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. T. Johnston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am in the fortunate position for once of being able on balance to support a new Clause proposed by my hon. and learned Friend. The Lord Advocate put a perfectly clear and explicit case against the Clause, but I rather think he overplayed his hand, possibly because he thought he required to use very strong arguments to meet my hon. and learned Friend. He said that when a similar Clause was moved in another place, it was withdrawn because of explanations given by the Government. I do not think that is the whole truth. The proposal in that case was made by Lord Alness who knows something about the law of Scotland, and he withdrew it under protest. His last sentence—I have it here—was that he withdrew it under protest because of the Government's attitude. He felt perfectly certain that the proposition was a valid one. One of the reasons I am supporting this, is because of the general argument that whatever is good for the Church of Scotland, and whatever privileges it may have, should equally apply to other large-scale religious denominations in Scotland. I do not think it is a valid argument to adduce the question of the "two-and-seventy
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1606</span>
jarring sects." If you are to give this privilege to the Church of Scotland, I sec no reason why it may not be given to the other large-scale denominations mentioned in the Clause if they want it.<br><br>
I think we should pay same attention to the unanimous recommendations of the Morison Committee. I do not agree with them all myself, but, for domestic reasons, I should like to support this one. The Morison Committee said in their report that they were satified there was a substantial demand for an alteration of the law on this subject. The Lord Advocate says this is an old and disappearing historical custom, mixed up with questions of giving public notice of important matters to local citizens, in regard to rats and mice, sheep-scab, etc.—all matters that are dealt with in notices on the church door. That is true. It is a relic of the days when almost everybody in a parish went to some church and therefore when an announcement was made from the pulpit, or was posted on the church door, the theory was that everybody in the parish would know about it. There are now probably far more people outside the Church of Scotland than in it. Many of them have no church at all. Many are also in these various dissident organisations, and it is obviously wrong that a relic of this kind should be maintained, for the benefit of the Church of Scotland and to some extent for the Quakers, and that these two organisations should be given powers which are denied to other large-scale organisations in the country. There might be a case for withdrawing altogether a mode or practice which no longer serves its purpose as far as the Church of Scotland is concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Lord Advocate</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is nothing in the Bill which enables the Quakers to proclaim banns.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Johnston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is true. The Quakers conduct their marriages according to a mode and practice" of their own, and they would not in any circumstances recognise the proclamation of banns in the Church of Scotland. But in Clause 3 they are permitted to contract marriages in their own manner without going through the forms of the Church of Scotland. These two organisations are put in a privileged position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mathers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that has anything to do with it. This is a question
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0797">Image</span>

of the proclamation of the banns, not of the carrying through of the marriage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Johnston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am saying that these two religious denominations in Scotland are in a privileged position in relation to the subject of marriage, which is denied to other religious organisations. I am arguing that a privilege, which may at one time have had an historical significance and which may have served a useful purpose in the parish no longer serves any useful purpose but that, if it is to be continued, it should be continued for all other organisations. As to the list in the Clause it was supplied by the Registrar-General for Scotland. It may be true that he has missed out a number of organisations which ought to be in it, and in that connection I am prepared to support the Amendment to the proposed new Clause in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling and Falkirk (Mr. Westwood) to include the Salvation Army.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That Amendment would not cover all the others up to the number of 80.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Johnston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, but I am prepared to support the Amendment as far as it goes and to widen the new Clause as far as possible. The question has been raised as to what would happen if a member of the Church of Scotland and a member of the Free Presbyterian Church wanted to get married. Would you have the proclamation made in the Church of Scotland? Why not make it in both? Personally I prefer the notice board, but I do not think there is any insuperable argument against the course which I suggest. I do not think that the new Clause matters very much, but, if fair play is to be given to other religious organisations in Scotland, I am prepared to support it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Westwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The new Clause has been moved on the ground that the Church of Scotland has a privilege compared with other churches in Scotland. I do not consider it a privilege but a handicap. The publications of banns is a point of "churchiality" and has nothing to do with Christianity as it is preached and practised. Consequently, I cannot see my way to support the new Clause. The same Clause was moved in another place, but even before that, some
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1608</span>
hon. Members were taking a keen interest in this particular problem. After the Morison Committee had reported the hon. Member for Dumbarton Burghs (Mr. Kirkwood) on 28th January, 1937, put a question on the Order Paper asking whether the Secretary of State was in a position to say what action he proposed to take on the report. On 2nd March, 1937, I myself put the following question to the Secretary of State:
<br><blockquote><p>whether he has now had time to consider the report of the Morison Committee on the Marriage Laws of Scotland and if he proposes to bring in any measure to give effect to the recommendations this Session; and, if so, will he before such proposed legislation is framed receive representations from, and have consultations with, the representatives of the Salvation Army with a view to their religious organisations being added to the list referred to on page 15 of the report who are recommended to receive power to proclaim a marriage and to issue banns of marriage."— [OFFICIAL REPORT, 2nd March, 1937, Col. 150, Vol. 321.]</p></blockquote>
If the new Clause should unfortunately get through—and personally I cannot see my way on conscientious grounds to vote for it—it would be grossly unfair to add to the list these other churches mentioned and leave out such a great organisation as the Salvation Army. The Salvation Army was not included in the list recommended by the Morison Committee, yet in Scotland they have more than 500 officers—I prefer to call them ministers— who are solemnly set apart for the preaching of the Gospel. They have over 200 churches, or corps as they call them. If the Committee should see its way to pass the new Clause there are no valid grounds whatever for the omission of such a large body as the Salvation Army. I understand that it is now accepted that if the new Clause does go through, there will be absolutely no difficulty in accepting my Amendment to include the Salvation Army. But I cannot vote for the new Clause. I do not think that all these other churches are out of step; it is the Church of Scotland which is out of step. It is like the old woman who said with enthusiasm as she saw the regiment marching past, "They are all out of step except my son Jock." It seems to me that the one body which is out of step is actually the Church of Scotland itself, and I say, without hesitation, that if the hon. and learned Member had moved an Amendment to take away this power from the Church of Scotland I should have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0798">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1609</span>
supported it. [AN HON. MEMBER: "As an Englishman! "] I am as Scottish and as patriotic as anyone in this room, and even more Scottish than many who were born in Scotland—under a misunderstanding and by mistake. I say without hesitation that I should have supported a proposal to take away this power from the Church of Scotland because I think the proclamation of banns has nothing whatever to do with religious service and the preaching of Christianity. The Salvation Army has given me my religious instruction and has provided it for my family and household and I am prepared to move my Amendment to bring them into line with other religious organisations. But I hope that the new Clause will not get a Second Reading.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mathers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would not like to give a silent vote on this matter, and I should not like it to be thought that as a member of the Church of Scotland I was seeking selfishly to retain what is looked upon by some as a privilege of that Church. The logic of the position is to extend the proclamation of banns so as to include every denomination that can be found, but in doing that, I think we should make confusion worse confounded. There is this outstanding fact, that some of the churches, even those named in the new Clause, do not wish to have this privilege, this duty, this responsibility placed upon them. It would mean that whatever list we make by law confering the opportunity on these bodies to proclaim banns of marriage, we would have some contracting out of the obligation, and not wishing to accept it. I think in that way we should be making for confusion, and it would be unwise to do so. I am not prepared to support the new Clause because it would not further the objects for which the Bill has been introduced.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. R. Gibson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had a very interesting discussion this morning on the proposed new Clause, and that, in itself, is a sufficient answer to any whimpering in the Press objecting to further discussion on this Bill. The discussion which has taken place has indicated the necessity for yet further discussion on the subject which has engaged the attention of the Committee this morning. Opposition to this Clause, in the main, is on two diverse lines. The first is that the Clause, as framed, is not broad enough. My hon. Friend the Member for Coat-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1610</span>
bridge (Mr. Barr) has indicated the large number of advertisements of religious bodies that we are accustomed to see in Press—and, in all Christian amity, are delighted to see—on a Saturday in Scotland. We wish all strength to those bodies each carrying its light in its own particular corner. But that is not a valid objection to the principle contained in the Clause. I respectfully agree with my right hon, Friend the Member for West Stirling (Mr. Johnston) who has supported the principle of the new Clause. My hon. Friend the Member for Stirling and Falkirk (Mr. Westwood), by his Amendment on the Paper ex hypotkesi shows that he is pleased with the principle contained in the Clause. The other line of opposition has been indicated quite clearly by my hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge and by the Lord Advocate. The former said quite clearly that banns were obsolete. The Lord Advocate would not go quite so far as that, but, showing a professional discrimination, he said that they were becoming obsolete.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Lord Advocate</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As a method of publication.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gibson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: And, of course, that is the only purpose that banns have.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Lord Advocate</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to suggest that banns are not widely used and widely appreciated. I merely mean that, as an efficient instrument of publication, they are becoming obsolete.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gibson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On that point we are at one. There is, on that <i>consensus in idem</i> between us. If this, as a method of publication, is obsolete, or practically so, the proper course is to abolish banns altogether. Accordingly my hon. Friend and the right hon. and learned Gentleman are just laying up trouble for the Report Stage. These being the two broad lines of opposition, I submit that the proper course is to support the principle and vote for the Second Reading of the Clause.<br><br>
There are one or two smaller matters with which I might deal. My hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge, by inference, made reference to Clause 1 as, in effect, limiting Clause 5. But these marriages in Scotland were always good marriages, and the use of the word "irregular" was wrong. The unfortunate thing is that the very vital word "invalid" is used in this Bill, and accordingly Clause 1 is a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0799">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1611</span>
restriction, and not an extension, of the right of people in Scotland. With regard to some of the main arguments adduced by the right hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for West Edinburgh (Mr. T. M. Cooper) he made some mention of appeasement. Why should he try to appease me? What is wrong with the 80 per cent, of the solicitors in Scotland? Why should he not seek to appease them, when he is the titular head of the legal profession of Scotland, whereas I am just an individual member of the Scottish Bar. He is forgetting, surely, that the principle of appeasement is one which has failed miserably in major politics; and why should he seek to pursue it in the narrow ambit of the Scottish law of marriage. He gave figures showing the number of marriages in Scotland in a particular year as being 33,000, and then he said, with a great fanfare of trumpets, and with all the panoply of the court of the Lyon King-at-Arms, that 25,000 of these were preceded by proclamation of banns. What about it? Those people who got themselves proclaimed did not do so because they ardently desired proclamation of banns. What is the usual procedure? Is it not that the banns are proclaimed three times?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barr</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If you want it done once only, you pay double.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gibson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is now getting into the little matter of monetary considerations. How many of the 25,000 paid the extra half-crown, or whatever the sum may be, in order to cut short, as far as they could, the publicity which banns themselves are intended to achieve? It is only a minority, of publicity hunters, who want the thing set out at large in the Press. Ordinary law-abiding people who want to go about their business in a quiet, douce, Scottish fashion get a few of their intimate friends together, and get married without bothering the community generally.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Johnston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How does my hon. and learned Friend's argument square with his previous proposal to endow the solicitors profession with a 10s. fee?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gibson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend had the misfortune not to be present at the last meeting. That ios. was not to go into the pocket of the lawyer, but to be handed over to the State.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1612</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We really cannot discuss that question again. The hon. and learned Member for Greenock (Mr. Gibson) was saying that we wanted to get on with the banns as quickly as possible; cannot we get on with the Clause as quickly as possible?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gibson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know, Sir Robert, whether you want to offer me half-a-crown to be short.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I do not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gibson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not hear anything about the 5s. which the Lord Advocate was to put into the pocket of the registrar, running into the coffers of the State. But that point will come up at another time. There was another argument on which the Lord Advocate seemed to lay some stress; and he actually seemed to convince my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Mathers) to a certain extent. That was, that if the Registrar-General was to have the duty of adjudicating on proposed rules and regulations for banns in a number of different church organisations, he would have a task imposed upon him that Atlas himself could not support. There is no ground for such an argument. My hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow is a member of a trade union. In Scotland we have a Registrar of Friendly Societies; and his duty is to approve rules and regulations of friendly societies, including trade unions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mathers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They are obligatory upon trade unions. I have pointed out that certain of these churches do not want to have this duty imposed on them, and do not want to have these regulations made on their behalf; and I do not consider that we should seem to compel those churches to conform in respect of matters which they do not want to take upon themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Colville)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. and learned Member a mandate from the churches mentioned in the Clause for the proposal he is making?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gibson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have the Report of the Morison Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Colville</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was not my point. Following the point made by the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Mathers), my question was, has the hon. and learned Member the support of the churches
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0800">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1613</span>
mentioned, when he asks that they should be called upon to undertake this duty?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gibson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has the right hon. Gentleman any mandate from any of these bodies to oppose the Clause? If the Secretary of State will take advice from his colleague, the right hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for West Edinburgh, he will discover that a mandate persists until it is withdrawn.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Westwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can assure the Secretary of State that I have a mandate for the Amendment that stands in my name.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gibson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very much obliged. Here is a new mandate that apparently was not in existence at the time when the Morison Committee was having these all-too-inadequate deliberations before their Report was framed. There is the position of the Registrar of Friendly Societies in Scotland, carrying on his work in a very quiet way, yet achieving agreement between trade unions that are violently opposed to one another.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Lord Advocate</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gibson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had occasion, as the right hon. Member for West Edinburgh knows, to write the article on trade unions for Lord Wark's Encyclopedia of the Law of Scotland, and I had to go into this matter very carefully. The amount of work that the Registrar of Friendly Societies does in achieving harmony between bodies that may very well have conflicting interests, is very much greater and more difficult than the work that would be carried out by the Registrar-General when approving regulations for the comparatively simple matter of the proclamation of banns. I think that meets the difficulty of the Lord Advocate, and meets it on lines that perhaps he did not expect.<br><br>
I do not want it to be said that . I have unduly taken up the time of the Committee, because I could easily have taken double the time I have, to the great delight and edification of the Members of the Committee. I will take away</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1614</span>
<p>any such objection to my speech, and leave the matter there. The principle of the new Clause is a sound one, and those who are supporting the Bill are under a certain obligation towards the Morison Committee's report. In fairness, they ought to carry out that obligation by giving effect to the report, and in order to do that, hon. Members ought to support the Second Reading of the new Clause.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of some of the arguments that have been advanced against my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Greenock (Mr. Gibson), who is earnestly doing his duty towards those whom he represents by carrying out the work he is doing and by paralysing, wherever possible, the activities of this very undesirable Government, I would like to ask whether, if the new Clause is carried, it will compel any or all of these churches to carry through this ceremony.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. T. Johnston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It only authorises them to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take it they would have power to do so if they desired, and the new Clause would not impose on anybody something which he did not want to have imposed on him. Therefore, the arguments which have been used against my hon. and learned Friend do not apply. It is obvious that any or all of these bodies should have the power to carry through this ceremony if they so desire. I cannot see why the Government should be so reluctant to accept the new Clause. If my hon. and learned Friend has had to take up a considerable amount of time, it is not his fault, but the fault of the Government and their supporters. Let them adopt an intelligent attitude towards this question and they will cause less trouble to my hon. and learned Friend. I hope hon. Members opposite will see the necessity of giving these churches the opportunity of carrying through this important ceremony if they desire to do so.</span></p>
