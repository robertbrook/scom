	<p>Motion made, and Question proposed [	<i>3rd July</i>]:
	<br><blockquote><p>"That the Chairman do now report to the House that Class V, Vote 15—Housing, Scotland, Class V, Vote 13—Department of Health for Scotland and Class I, Vote 27—Scottish Home Department have been considered by the Committee."—[	<i>Mr. McNeil.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>Question again proposed.</p>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel Elliot</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is quite clear that we shall not be able to report that we have been able adequately to examine these Estimates if we have only today's Sitting in which further to consider them. Therefore, I would propose on behalf of the Opposition that we ask the Committee to consider this matter at another Sitting, thus giving a third day for housing, which should be one of our sitting days next week. I trust that that will be for the convenience of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate (Mr. John Wheatley)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The choice of days and subjects is entirely a matter within the competence of the Opposition. I am sure it will meet the convenience of hon. Members on this side of the Committee if we have another day's (debate on housing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Committee adjourned on Tuesday, the hon. Member for Leith (Mr. Hoy) had the Floor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hoy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Committee adjourned last Tuesday I was saying that I was surprised by some of the figures and comparisons of the hon. and gallant Member for Pollok (Commander Galbraith). I used the figures he had given about the production of houses in the three years up to and including 1950. I said that the average production was then better than anything hitherto attained. I do not want anybody to think that I believe we have reached the
	<span class='label label-info column'>2330</span>
absolute limit, because if we had it would be extremely disappointing to the people of Scotland. But when he compared that with the inter-war years I would remind him that if we had built then at the same rate of production as we have done in recent years, Scotland would today be richer by 160,000 houses. That would have been a remarkable contribution to the housing problem, and would have saved us from many of the difficulties which face us today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and gallant Member then spoke of the difference between England and Scotland, and he made this remarkable statement which I want to quote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"That question leads me to ask, why is it that the position in England is so much better than in Scotland? That has been the case over many years; and, that being so, how was it that England got so far ahead of us in the inter-war years? In that period we built only one house for every 15 of our population, whereas in England they built one house for every 10 of the population."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, Scottish Standing Committee, 3rd July, 1951; c. 10.]</p></blockquote>
That may be perfectly true, but why does the hon. and gallant Gentleman pose that question to this Government? Why did he not pose it to the Government responsible for that state of affairs? Indeed, it is a remarkable condemnation of the rule of his own party when he makes these comparisons. It is true that this condemnation is borne out by the fact that in a previous debate on housing in this Committee the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Sir W. Darling) interrupted my right hon. and learned Friend the Lord Advocate and spoke of the lag in Scottish housing for 25 years. So those two hon. Members opposite are undoubtedly agreed that the Scottish housing record of their own party is something to be deplored.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further, as my hon. Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy Burghs (Mr. Hubbard) said in the course of his contribution, in Scotland there was for some years a considerable number of unemployed key workers. In the 1948 debate on this question that was thrashed out between the right hon. and gallant Gentleman the Member for Kelvingrove (Lieut.-Colonel Elliot) and the Lord Advocate. It is true that for a number of years in Scotland, especially between the years 1931 and 1935, we had hundreds of building workers—not labourers but plasterers and bricklayers, who are key building trade
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1950-1951V000P0I1208">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2331</span>
workers—signing on at the employment exchanges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we look at the figures which the right hon. and gallant Gentleman the Member for Kelvingrove has examined we will find that between 1931 and 1935 the lowest figure reached for unemployed bricklayers was 118, but in one year, following the cuts of 1931, 901 bricklayers were unemployed. In that year, too, there were 674 plasterers in the same position. In those days there was a tremendous wastage of building trade labour, and in addition it must be remembered that materials were then in plentiful supply. Combined, these two factors could have made a tremendous contribution to Scotland's housing needs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel Elliot</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member will not deny that much of that labour was completely absorbed in the years immediately before the war.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hoy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say other than that. I was speaking about the years 1931 to 1935. In the years 1936, 1937 and 1938 unemployment was at its lowest. I have not sought to deny it, but there was an average unemployment over those three years of 80 bricklayers on the books of the Scottish employment exchanges. In those key years there was that chronic unemployment—it could only be regarded as chronic—among key workers in the building industry, and all I am saying is that that was one of the factors which resulted in a poor output of housing in Scotland compared with what was taking place in England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that the position is very different today. Now we have a policy of full employment, and our people are fully employed. With that full employment, there is also a scarcity of materials, and that brings us up against another problem. The natural consequence of that, whether we like it or not, or whether we be in Opposition or on the Government side of the Committee, is that there must be a policy of planning and allocating the available resources of raw materials. That is always extremely difficult because of the conflicting claims seeking to make a demand on such resources as there are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is no use giving housing all the building materials and labour in an effort to satisfy this problem, when there are also
	<span class='label label-info column'>2332</span>
the claims of education, including the building of schools, which we all agree is very desirable, the claims of hospitals, accommodation for old people and industry, because it is not very much use having houses for the people if there is no work for them to do. If people are to be employed we have to have modernised industry, and in Scotland we have to devote a great part of our resources to the creation of new industries to give us that diversified employment which has been so long lacking within our Scottish economy. There is also a substantial claim by the churches of our country, who rightly claim that in the new areas which are being built provision should be made for them in order that they can cater for religious requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the face of all these conflicting demands, the Government of the day has to make an allocation for each of these sources. At this point I should like to enter a slight disagreement with my hon. Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy Burghs on the subject of prefabricated houses. He had some hard things to say about their defects, but I do not believe we can solve this problem, or even go any way towards solving it, without combining the resources of the builders of not only the orthodox building but of the prefabricated type of building. We have to enlist all available building resources to solve the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only alternative method of construction to the orthodox one that I can see is this type of prefabrication, and we can then add to our resources for houses and factories this scheme of prefabricated erections. Not only have we to consider the prefabricated type of building, but we have also to consider the type of materials that have to be used. If prefabrication is to be successful then there has to be the necessary flow of materials which are required. Perhaps we have not done sufficient experimenting, but we have an instrument for that readily available in the Scottish Special Housing Association.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That Association has a function to perform, but it is not its function merely to compete with the available labour resources for the erection of orthodox houses, except when these houses are going to be built in rural areas where, in many cases, the private builder will not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1950-1951V000P0I1209">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2333</span>
build because of the inaccessibility and the very great difficulties of securing labour. The Scottish Special Housing Association can play a very successful part in the erection of the slag foam house, and I should be grateful if my right hon. and learned Friend, when he replies, would say something about the future of the Scottish Special Housing Association.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must have regard, too, to the price of certain prefabricated commodities. My hon. Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Robertson) raised the question of the production of gypsum and the gypsum interior. I want to know if gypsum is being produced in adequate amounts. My information is that the firm responsible for its production cannot even produce sufficient for its own requirements. I should also like to know what the cost of it is, because whether we like it or not that cost will be reflected in the rent that the occupants ultimately will have to pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian that we must not get to the stage where production costs so much that the rent is too high for certain classes of our people. I hope that that argument will be given a little consideration on the other side of the Committee. I remember that not so long ago, when we were dealing with a Bill concerning improvements to houses and grants for landlords, we considered a provision for paying the owner an increase on the rent of 6 per cent. of the amount of his expenditure, or up to £18 on a £300 investment. We had violently to resist a proposal from the other side of the Committee that the landlord should get £24 more instead of £18 as we proposed. It does not alter the argument that if we are going to do that, we have at least to see that the rent is as economical as possible for the people requiring these houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One other step might bring results—and I was glad that my right hon. Friend referred to it: the introduction of incentives. Five years ago, when Mr. Buchanan was Under-Secretary of State, suggested in the House, that an incentive scheme might be introduced between building trade employers and their employees. We
	<span class='label label-info column'>2334</span>
can take some encouragement here because, if we accept only the estimate given by the Ministry of Works, that by these schemes we might expect a 10 per cent. increase in the number of houses, then that would be a contribution which ought not to be despised. If those results had been achieved in the last three years we should have had 7,500 more houses in Scotland. I should like some further information from my right hon. Friend about this. Has a scheme been agreed? Has it been brought into operation? If so, can he give us any results to prove that it is working effectively?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may turn for a moment to the question of sites. We have had complaints for so long from local authorities about the lack of sites, suggesting that that is one of the factors holding up housing progress in our country. We have to face this fact: in Scotland, and even in Britain as a whole, we cannot go on for ever eating into our agricultural land. That would be quite impossible. Thus, we have to consider alternative sites, and I suggest that in many cities in Scotland there must be old slum property and old slum sites which could readily be used for the erection of new blocks of flats. In my constituency houses have been standing idle for many years—since long before the war. Not only are they an eyesore but they are a blot on the community and a great waste of valuable space. My hon. Friends remind me that not only are they a blot, but in many cases they are a danger to human life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to know what plans are being prepared for the removal of these old buildings and the erection of modern, up-to-date flats, which I am sure could be built much more quickly than the present type of building. Such a plan would also provide living accommodation for certain classes of workers who, by reason of their occupations, have to live in fairly close proximity to their work. Certainly in my constituency, where a great number of people are employed in the docks, it is essential that housing accommodation should be provided fairly near to the place of employment. When we talk of flats we do not mean the dirty, vile and filthy tenements which have been associated with Scotland for so long, but modern, up-to-date flats with all the modern amenities we can provide. I suggest that the Secretary of State might do something in this regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1950-1951V000P0I1210">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2335</span>
My final point deals with co-operation or liaison between local authorities and the central Department. One has only to look at the figures of house building in Scotland last year to see the amazing difference between one town and another. I regret to state that the city of Edinburgh compares most unfavourably with any other city in Scotland in this respect. Last year it built what was nearly a record low number. I understand that this is giving grave concern to the people in the city, and certainly it is giving grave concern to the homeless in the city.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot for the life of me understand why house production in the city of Edinburgh should be at such a low level. There was a further comment on the subject in the Edinburgh Press last night. Apparently we are building at a lower rate even than the low level of last year. The housing convenor, who apparently is doing everything he can to rectify the position, made this statement in the "Edinburgh Evening News" last night:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We have the labour. We have the contractors. We have the sites. In fact, we seem to have everything but the results I, personally, feel we ought to have."</p></blockquote>
This approach is somewhat different from that of his predecessor, because in the past there were always some excuses for not doing things. Here we have the housing convenor saying that he has all these things, but that he is not getting the results he desires. I want to know, and I think the Scottish Office should know, whether the housing convenor thinks it is time that some inquiry was made to see what is holding up production. Can it be that there are certain people not really interested in producing houses—or, certainly, houses to rent? When we get a statement of the kind made by the housing convenor, I think it calls for investigation by the Scottish Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The few suggestions I have made may not be a complete solution to the problem, but contained within them there may be justification for an investigation which may help to alleviate the difficulties. In view of the appalling demand for housing in Scotland all our resources should be concentrated on solving this problem, and if we are to solve it for the vast majority of our people we have to build these houses at rents they can afford to pay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>2336</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. J. N. Browne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In listening to this debate I have been struck, more than in any other debate to which I have listened, by the differing angles of approach to this very serious problem. Whichever way one looks at it, the problem seems to be equally bad. I have been very anxious not to generalise—not to be led away by the cases of which we all know which sometimes make us ashamed to have a home of our own. I have tried to base my conclusions on a cross-section of those problems which face unfortunate people and to arrive at a balance between one type of evil and another, because my experience is that by breaking down a problem, sometimes one can find at least a partial solution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With this in mind I asked my secretary to take out at random forty of the housing cases which have come to my notice since I have been in the House. I realise only too well that these housing cases are not a Parliamentary responsibility, and that anything we get in that respect is as nothing compared with the cases dealt with by the local authority representatives. I have visited all these cases personally, except two. Two of them belong to the constituency of the hon. Member for Tradeston (Mr. Rankin) who, I am sure, dealt with them just as carefully and assiduously as I do myself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of the thirty-eight cases which were left, there was one case of de-requisitioning of a house at Greenock, and I am glad to say it was afterwards de-requisitioned. There was one hard luck story which, on investigation, was found to be unjustified, and I would not take the matter any further. There were nine mother-in-law cases, technical cases; the sort of case we shall get to the end of time. That left me with 27 cases, and I put those 27 cases under six broad headings. I should like to break those headings down. To some extent they show the appalling troubles which face our people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was one case-4 per cent. of the cases—of people married and separated, living with their own parents. That is something which is more frustrating than nearly anything else facing us to-day, and we all know how urgently we have to deal with that sort of case, which is 4 per cent. of those I considered. Next, there were two cases-7 per cent.—where people suffered from the frustration of living in lodgings. I remettiber that there was a man and his wife, with a boy of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1950-1951V000P0I1211">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2337</span>
nine, who had lived in one furnished sitting room all their married life. It is a pity that the medical officer cannot take some account of the mental condition into which these people get through living in furnished rooms in other people's homes. It is only by realising what these people have to endure that we appreciate the extent of their problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then there were three cases, or 11 per cent., of tuberculosis, or suspected tuberculosis. One was certified and, quite rightly, was dealt with immediately. Two were borderline cases, and because I think this is symptomatic of many of the cases which occur I should like to read to the Committee a letter addressed to me by the divisional medical officer of health. I will not give the names. He writes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I informed him"—</p></blockquote>
that is, the City Factor—
	<br><blockquote><p>"that Mr. and Mrs. — together with their three children occupy a small room and kitchen. …I informed him that they had a son, John, 10½ years, who had been under observation at Govan Town Hall since 1946. Although not a notified case of pulmonary tuberculosis, he had been a delicate child who had been in convalescent homes and required a good deal of careful attention. Incidentally, I added that the house was damp and hardly congenial for a delicate child. I asked him to give the family favourable consideration at an early date."</p></blockquote>
I think we have to consider very carefully whether near tuberculosis cases are being given the right priority, in the interests of the people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Next, and 15 per cent., were four cases of damp property.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was rather interested in what the hon. Gentleman said about not giving the correct priority to tuberculosis cases. We must remember always that local people know the local circumstances and have a proper allocation system. Is he suggesting changing the system to make certain that these people get a proper allocation? I do not think we should say anything which might be construed as suggesting that this power of direction and allocation should be given to a central source instead of being left to the local people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Browne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I go all the way with the hon. 'Member. I was merely pointing out what we get when we break down these figures. There were four cases of
	<span class='label label-info column'>2338</span>
damp property, one in Penilee. I have the Adjournment debate on the subject on Thursday week, so I will not draw attention to it now, except to say that it makes me nervous of non-traditional houses. My experience there leads me to support the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy Burghs (Mr. Hubbard) and not to support the hon. and gallant Member for Angus, South (Captain Duncan) when he suggests that non-traditional houses are a good investment. I cannot believe that they are. My experience is to the contrary. In the other three cases of damp I went to the factors and in every case they corrected it. I have no complaint on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Next, I come to eight cases of overcrowding—which is 30 per cent. of these cases. That is to say, almost one-third were cases of overcrowding. I will give three examples. The first was of four in one room—a man, his wife, and two children, in a room 13 ft. x 6 ft. There was another child on the way. The next case was of eight in two rooms—a man and his wife, and six children. In respect of this case, I wrote to the City Factor and asked, in no spirit of levity, how many more children the family would have to have before technical overcrowding took place and gave them priority, and the answer was that there was no technical overcrowding—it just helped on points. Next, was a case of ten in four rooms—eight adults and two children. There was a man and his wife, two sons, aged 21 and 26, four daughters, aged 19, 21, 25 and 30, and two grandchildren.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think this state of affairs is a disgrace to civilisation, and every bit as bad as the evils of unemployment and poverty. It has been kept out of the public eye, but after six years of rule, and after so many broken promises, I think the Socialist Party stand for all time condemned by the unwholesome facts that face us today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to the last heading, in conclusion. There were nine cases—that is, 33 per cent.—of applications for exchange of house. I tried to find out the reason for these exchanges. There is more than one case in Govan where old people are condemned to die in the top flat. An old lady has to wait for her son to come home to carry her downstairs. In another case, a wife has to wait for her husband
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1950-1951V000P0I1212">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2339</span>
to come home to carry her downstairs. There is another case of an old lady in a four-roomed house, with a kitchen, all by herself, probably condemned to die in the house because she cannot get an exchange of property.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Jean Mann</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member's party is in power in Glasgow, why does he not do something about these exchanges?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Browne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My job is to state the facts as I find them, and I will state them in just the way I feel about them. There was another case of a change of jobs, which is very necessary to industry today. Every exchange that adds accommodation should be encouraged. Every exchange based on medical grounds should be encouraged. Every exchange which helps workers and every exchange which helps old people should be encouraged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that one cannot use compulsion, but my experience is that people can find exchanges for themselves. My experience is not a happy one. The Corporation refused one case, granted one, and were helpful in two. They were sticky, but they were not obstructive. Of the remaining five cases, the private factor granted one and refused four.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think the Committee must face the fact that there are houses for sale and not for letting. Some tenement properties offered for sale are being run at a loss. In many cases they are owned by the children of the original purchasers who are not wealthy people, and in many cases also the owner is forced to offer the house for sale because that is his only alternative to giving it to the Corporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have some sympathy with these cases. The Government cannot leave the position as it is, but there are other cases where the necessity for sale is not so great. In some cases, if exchanges could be allowed, it would materially help to solve the problem, and I would appeal to owners of such property to give priority to public over individual consideration on the question of exchanges, which represent 33 per cent. of the genuine housing problems in my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are we going to do about tenement buildings? I went over 12 houses.
	<span class='label label-info column'>2340</span>
I found three with rat holes in them—25 per cent.; four with damaged plaster —30 per cent.; five damp—41 per cent.; seven with damaged sinks—60 per cent.; seven with broken floors—60 per cent.; eight with very bad windows—67 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are we going to do with these properties? I know it is throwing good money after bad to repair them, and they should be pulled down. But they cannot be pulled down and therefore some short-term policy is essential. People should not be asked to live in such houses. I have some suggestions to make, but whether they are satisfactory ones I do not know. Would it be worth trying to organise some form of self help? For instance, could plaster be given to fill up the holes and to cure the draughts? In many houses, one can put one's hand right through the walls, but it only needs a bit of plaster to put that right. Could wood and nails be given so that the floors and sink surrounds could be repaired? And if the tenant makes a good job of these repairs, could not some paint be given?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the windows, the corporation or somebody must deal with that problem. The tenants cannot be asked to repair windows. At the moment, the people cannot even keep out the draughts. As to sinks, if the landlord cannot buy them I think someone else should take a hand in that matter. Much of the woodwork has dry rot and all that can be done is to patch it. I can see no solution to that problem; it will have to be dealt with separately. Lastly, there is the question of lavatories. I do not know what we can do to put this problem right. I know that the tenants repair them as far as they can, but something ought to be done about the lavatory position in these houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another point about these properties—the back courts. I am told that the back courts are the responsibility of the landlord. The sanitary authorities only take a hand when, as often happens, the sewage seeps up into the court. In many cases, the courts are nothing but quagmires and in the winter the tenants have either to put on rubber boots or to lay down bricks in order to walk across. I suggest that the corporation might try to brighten the

	<span class='label label-info column'>2341</span>
lives of the people concerned by taking over the maintenance of back courts. We really must do something to try and brighten the lives of these people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now want to turn to a broader aspect. The Glasgow Corporation have the best housing record of any town in the country. Therefore, when we are talking about Glasgow housing, we are talking about the very best effort in housing in the country. In 1950, as my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Pollok (Commander Galbraith) said, they built 4,167 houses. But there were 100,000 people on the waiting list. He said that it would take 25 years to put this matter right. I suggest he was very moderate; he did not show the situation to be as bad as it is because there are 16,000 condemned houses in Glasgow alone and 525 dangerous houses. With 4,000 houses being built it looks to me that it will be nearer 50 years than 25 years before the housing needs are met; or it might even be that in Glasgow we are just marking time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Are the Government doing everything they can? The Secretary of State for Scotland mentioned bricks. He said we have 263,000,000 bricks—that is not enough. He mentioned plasterboard, but I suggest that it is open to question whether the Government, who are now putting a discriminatory price control on one firm, are helping very much to get us all the plasterboard we need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the question of old people's homes. This comes under Part IV of the National Assistance Act. It is a very attractive idea. There are many big houses in Glasgow where the old people could live. It would overcome their loneliness, and they could look after themselves to a great extent. I think voluntary associations might help and, of course, nothing would relieve the housing pressure more than the putting of these old people into homes. I realise only too well that it is a very expensive business, but I think it is worthy of examination. I am not sure that the present standards for old people's homes are really essential in view of the housing problem. I believe that by lowering such standards —not too much—we could do a great deal towards increasing the number of such homes in the towns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think the Socialist Party are beginning to realise that private ownership has
	<span class='label label-info column'>2342</span>
some benefits and I should like to suggest that owners of corporation property should be given the right to purchase new houses built by private builders who get block licences on condition that they can build with their existing labour force. That would get out of corporation property people who want to own houses and would leave the property they vacate available for other people needing accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Glasgow Corporation are working along the right lines. I understand the 500 houses are now being built by block licence and will be sold privately. The Corporation are considering the sale of Corporation houses. That will be a great advantage. It will relieve the taxpayer and the ratepayer of all subsidy and maintenance costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lastly, what priority are we going to give to dealing with these tragic housing conditions and the depth of human misery and discomfort which they reveal? When I see workers coming through the trim, freshly painted gates of a factory on their way home to the rat holes, the damaged sink and the draughts, I ask myself a question. I know that the machine is essential and that it must be housed, but surely, the spirit of the worker operating the machine is equally important. Surely, Britain depends just as much for her survival on the spirit of the worker as on the machine. Are the conditions of the worker really less important than the conditions of the machine?

I wish to draw the attention of the Committee to a report in the "New York Herald-Tribune" economic review of 8th April. It is headed, "E.C.E. Report Warns Against Cuts in Housing." The article states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A special Report by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe has warned that housing needs should not be sacrificed because of the current international situation."</p></blockquote>
It then goes on to state
	<br><blockquote><p>"Representatives of 12 Governments and 11 specialised international organisations called on European Governments to maintain and, whenever possible, to expand their present housing programmes, both for social reasons and for reasons of general productivity.'</p></blockquote>
The article ended by saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Executive Secretary of the E.C.E. said, ' It would be a great error if housing became one of the first casualties of strained international relations.' "</p></blockquote>
My firm belief is that housing conditions such as those to which I and my hon. and

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Jean Mann</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with very great interest to the hon. Member for Govan (Mr. Browne), but as far as I could see, he made no suggestions which might help the people of Govan to increase the output of houses or to find better houses. Housing lists are getting bigger every day. That is a result of the Labour Party's policy of full employment. It is the result of the higher standard of living demanded by the people. I am old enough to remember that in the old days there were thousands of Glasgow people who refused to put down their names for a new house. Nowadays it would be difficult to find someone who had not put down his name for a new house. The Tory Party could reduce the waiting list immediately if they got into power by unemployment and high rents.

The young man about to be married today says, "I can take a chance; I have got a job." But in the days of depression, the young man said, "It is no use my getting married; I have got neither a job nor a house." If those days ever return, the people living in their sub-standard houses will look at the growing unemployment list and will say, "We will take our names off the waiting list for houses because we could never afford a new house."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now come to the statement made by the hon. and gallant Member for Pollok (Commander Galbraith) revealing what the Tory Party would do. In it, he went back again to private enterprise, so let us examine the record of private enterprise. How many houses did private enterprise build in Scotland between 1918 and 1939 for letting? Please note the operative words are "for letting." How many were
	<span class='label label-info column'>2344</span>
built by local authorities? Private enterprise in the 21 years built 8,000 and the local authorities built 227,000; and the Tories want us to go back to the 21 years when for letting private enterprise built 8,000. They profess in this Committee to be worried at the length of time it will take to overtake the waiting list.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How long would it take to overtake it if we went back to private enterprise? "Planning Our New Homes" lays down that we require 500,000 new houses. If we figure this out, we find that by the Tory method of private enterprise it would take 2,000 years to overtake the waiting list.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Mann</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder if the Tories ever learn anything. Progress in these 21 years in the production of new Housing Acts was immense. There has been nothing like it in history. One Housing Act followed another in the annals of the House of Commons and the classic example was the withdrawal of the most successful Act of all, the Wheatley Act. The Tories profess to be astonished that young couples cannot find houses, that they are in lodgings and that they are living with their in-laws. Why is Scotland not told that young couples were taken completely out of the housing list when the Tory Party introduced the Housing (Financial Provisions) Act, 1933?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have looked it up in HANSARD. It was introduced first for England and it was camouflaged by a great drive on slum clearance. That was how it was first intimated that there would be no houses for young couples. Sir Hilton Young, introducing it, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"…subsidies actually raise costs, and that if you remove subsidies you lower costs."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 15th December, 1932; Vol. 273, c. 544.]</p></blockquote>
and so they took away all the subsidies that stood on the Statute Book.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note they took away all but those on slum dwellings. A great inroad was
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1950-1951V000P0I1215">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2345</span>
to be made on slum clearance. It was announced that at a rate of 12,000 houses per annum there would be a great inroad into slum clearance and our friend James Maxton made these remarks:
	<br><blockquote><p>"…one hon. Member said there were 1,000,000 houses just now that can be classified as slum houses. My arithmetic while on my feet is always a little dubious, and I use the figure with all hesitation, but that seems to me to put the achievement of the clearance of slums at …83½ years…the majority of them will be slums before the 83½ years that it will take to wipe out the present 1,000,000 have expired."—[OFFICIAL. REPORT, 15th December, 1932; Vol. 273, c. 614.]</p></blockquote>
And hon. Members wonder why there is such a big housing problem. I think the Tories pay us a big compliment indeed when they challenge us on the grounds that we have not solved this terrific mess in a period of six years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Their solution to all this is to be found in the Sorn Report. I hope the next party political broadcast from the B.B.C. by the Tory Party will really tell the public just exactly what the Sorn Report recommends. I take it that it is now Tory Party policy, because the hon. and gallant Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Commander Galbraith) said that the Report has now been in the hands of the Secretary of State since 1945—that is for six years—and that nothing has been done about it. Am I right in assuming that the party opposite will put these recommendations into practice if they come into power? Let hon. Members opposite tell me and I will sit down and give way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Colonel J. R. H. Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Watch your blood pressure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Mann</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I sat down and waited for a reply, but hon. Members opposite are running away from my challenge and no wonder. The Sorn Report deals with the rating of new houses and recommends, on page 23, a limitation of owners' rating by a reduction of 75 per cent. on the consolidated rate; in other words, de-rating to all property owners and particularly to the owner-occupier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here we see the Tory policy unfolding, bringing in private enterprise to build houses for the owner-occupier. Did not hon. Members hear the hon. Member for Govan (Mr. Browne) suggesting that corporation tenants should no longer be tenants but owner-occupiers? And the Sorn Report will give them 75 per cent.
	<span class='label label-info column'>2346</span>
de-rating of all their rates. The Report said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"…the relief should operate for the first twenty-five years of the life of each house…We desire to emphasise that the relief is wholly required to remove the rating disability from private enterprise."</p></blockquote>
That is not all. The Report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Our information is…that the Scotsman of the wage-earning class has always been disinclined to allocate as great a proportion of his earnings for rent as the English tenant of the same class."</p></blockquote>
So it is up with the rents for the people of Scotland, in spite of the fact that unemployment has always been greater there than in England—and nothing has been said about that in the Sorn Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That Report adds:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Here, then, is another factor restricting the operations of private house builders, who must see the possibility of charging rents ensuring an economic return before they will provide houses for letting."</p></blockquote>
Will we hear that in party political broadcasts and on the platforms of the hon. Member for Govan and the hon. and gallant Member for Pollok? We will hear it, of course, from the hon. and gallant Member for Renfrew, East (Major Lloyd) who represents an area almost completely owner-occupied. How delighted his constituents will be to know the Sorn Report will be put into operation and they will be relieved of 75 per cent. of their rates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Commander Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Lady tell us who were the members of the Sorn Committee? It might be interesting to know. Were there no representatives of the Labour Party on it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Mann</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There were two, one of whom agreed. The other presented a minority report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Sorn Report also said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"So far as the future is concerned we are of opinion that it is essential to remove this difficulty in order to restore confidence in Scottish House property as an investment."</p></blockquote>
Please note, "as an investment" and not as a social service. The report added:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This could be done in one of two ways; either by permitting owners of rent-controlled property to recover increases in rates by raising their rents; or by limiting the owners' rates so that they do not exceed the present figures—…"</p></blockquote>
That is the policy—either limit the owners' rates and give them a heavy subsidy, towards which everybody else is to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1950-1951V000P0I1216">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2347</span>
make a contribution, or else raise the rents. I am quite sure that policy will not be announced from the platform of the Tory Party. If any of them feel they would like to announce their real policy I am sure we shall all be very glad to have the reactions of the audiences to such an announcement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to depart now from that subject and discuss the great increase in the cost of house building. This increase will be a stumbling block if the rents are raised and local authorities are saddled with a very great debit on their housing accounts. I notice from the debate that took place when the subsidy was withdrawn and the Wheatley Act was cast into the wastepaper basket that the estimate at that period for a three-apartment house was £231 and for a four-apartment house £258 exclusive of land. But we were told by Mr. Skelton that, including the land, the all-in cost was £300. At Kinghorn a three-apartment flat cost £249, at Kirriemuir it was £251, at Bathgate it was £264, at Buckhaven it was £250 and at Markench it was £264. The figure for a three-apartment tenement in Glasgow was £231; and the Secretary of State has announced that the price today is to be £1,475.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To what is this increase to be attributed? Is it nationalisation? We have heard so much about the great increases in the prices of coal, electricity, railway fares since the Government nationalised those industries, but here is an increase that is the daddy of them all. It transcends all that the nationalised boards could ever think of, and I am convinced that the Government and the local authorities are being exploited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember when I was Convenor of Housing going to the architect and announcing that our programme was to be 20,000 houses in the next five years. He said, "Keep it quiet." I said, "Why keep it quiet?" He replied, "Whenever you announce in the Press a great speedup of building, the prices will rise." Surely there was also something in the statement made by Sir Hilton Young when introducing the Housing (Financial Provisions) Act that the withdrawing of subsidies would probably lower costs. There was exploitation of the subsidy and the fact that the Government were in the hands of the builders. According to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>2348</span>
housing lists we are in their hands for all time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can remember trying to break the rings; the light castings ring, the sanitary ware ring and the asbestos ring. I remember gathering all the local authorities of Scotland at one big conference to see if we could break up these rings. What the Government ought to do, instead of cutting standards, is to get going an inquiry into the operation of the housing ring, the sanitary ware ring the asbestos ring and the light castings ring. Let us have some report on the operations of these rings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tell the Government Front Bench straightly that if there is to be a lowering of the standard of these houses I for one shall be in revolt. I will not tolerate houses going up in Scotland where the furniture has to be pushed through the windows, and where the doors will lead from apartment to apartment. I was astonished by a Labour Member who said the other day—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Browne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I live in a house where all my furniture has to come through the window and I live there very happily.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Mann</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I dare say. That must be due to the affection of the hon. Member for private enterprise which would allow him to be happy with anything, so long as it had been erected by private enterprise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, the windows are much bigger.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Mann</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear from the Secretary of State that we are to cut out the passages. What he said, in the technical jargon, was "circulation space," that is halls, passages and stairways. I have never lived in a corporation house, but I have been in many of them, and I have yet to see one that I consider has an adequate space either in the hall or on the stairway. If we cut out the passages what does it mean? It means direct entrance to the front room. We have seen it in England where one opens a door and one is right into the parlour of the house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I noticed that one of our best architects in Scotland was writing in the "Sunday Mail." As I consider him the best architect in Britain, I read his article twice
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1950-1951V000P0I1217">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2349</span>
to find out where he would get this reduction of superficial square feet area. I have not found out yet. He told us that the rooms will be of the same size, exactly the same size. I can only assume that there is to be an entrance without a passage-way. When a mother is bathing her baby at the living room fire, the rag man can come to the door, or the minister, or the wee man from the society. Anybody will be able to walk into the privacy of our Scottish people. I hope that will be resented from one end of Scotland to the other. If the passageways are to be eliminated by means of inter-communicating doors we shall have the ring-a-ring-o'-roses house, where the family, by joining hands, can stretch through the rooms from the back of the house to the front.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that the Secretary of State is not here today, because I prefer to attack a man when he is present rather than to attack him behind his back. I hope that every Scottish Member in the House will see the plans and that every Scottish Member will make it a duty to look at them. I for one will resist fiercely any plan that contains any such provision. The solution is to get a little more vigour into our programme; to bring down the prices by attacking the rings and combines and to institute an immediate inquiry into why these prices should sky-rocket as they are doing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord John Hope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Coatbridge and Airdrie (Mrs. Mann) has told us, with characteristic courage, how in the past she has attacked the various rings and how she intends to do so in the future. I am sure we can look forward, judging from the latter part of her speech, to her making a fierce assault on yet another ring, which I think she called the ring-a-ring-o'-roses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady has done a certain amount of good by attacking the Tory Party on its past housing history, because she has emphasised a perfectly healthy truth, not understood by everyone outside this House, which is that we cannot take housing out of politics. It is unrealistic to try to do so. I would, however, suggest to her that the people of Scotland are more likely to be interested in the failures of the present Government, who are responsible at the moment, rather than in whatever failures may be attributed to
	<span class='label label-info column'>2350</span>
past Governments. As I say, it is unrealistic to talk about taking housing out of politics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not a non-party matter, and what people mean when they talk about putting housing outside politics is that housing is a bi-partisan matter, if ever there was one; by which I mean that obviously both parties want to see this worst of all problems solved. I do not suppose that anyone will disagree when I say that no political experiment, whether Socialist or Conservative, can go on its way towards fulfilment against a background of chronic hopelessness. I do not suppose that anyone would disagree that the only people who stand to gain in a state of chronic hopelessness are the Communists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The speech of the Secretary of State for Scotland on Tuesday was remarkable first of all for its frankness. The right hon. Gentleman catalogued the main faults which lie behind the failure of the Government and no Government is really weakened by admitting its faults frankly, especially over a vital matter which concerns the people. The Secretary of State spoke of a lack of balance. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Committee will remember that in Scotland things have got badly out of balance. We had 60,000 houses in various stages of construction, very low stages. We had to take steps to make sure of an orderly process, affording us a reasonable and increasing number of completions…"</p></blockquote>
That is the first fault. The second he referred to was in the distribution of materials. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"…we ran into a patchy distribution of bricks and cement."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 3rd July, 1951; c. 21–2.]</p></blockquote>
That is entirely the fault of the Government. To run into a patchy distribution of cement is a failure of Government planning; and I would remind the Committee that that occurred when the production of cement was rising all the time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Joint Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Thomas Fraser)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Neither was allocated by the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord John Hope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh, yes. It is no use the Under-Secretary trying to tell me that the failure of the distribution in building materials is not the result of bad Government planning, because quite obviously it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third fault admitted by the Secretary of State was the lack of incentive
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1950-1951V000P0I1218">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2351</span>
when he referred to an agreement negotiated recently with building operatives and the management side of the industry, by which a system of incentives should be applied. Why, after the Government have been in power all these years, should they suddenly start thinking about a system of incentives?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not suddenly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord John Hope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is clear that the psychological dislike of the Labour Party in earlier days for a system of incentives is the reason why the programme is so slow in getting under way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Member aware that when I brought the building trade operatives in Scotland together they reproached the employers for not putting into effect a system of incentives which had been put into operation in England a long period before; and that the building trade employers of Scotland refused to put these incentives into operation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord John Hope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may or may not be so, but the fact remains that my argument is still sound, so far as it applies to the fundamental dislike of incentives of the party opposite. That cannot be denied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But it is denied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord John Hope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know it is a new idea—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not at all; it is a very old one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord John Hope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not in the party opposite. As I see it those were the mistakes as outlined by the Secretary of State, and I think it is to his credit that they were so frankly admitted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the credit side I consider the right hon. Gentleman was right to tell the Committee of his decision to inquire into conditions in Holland. I think the further afield the Government can go for hints, the better it will be. I hope that Holland is not the only country in which they will institute inquiries as to how this grave problem may be solved. I wish to ask whether that inquiry in Holland will include an inquiry into the lay-out of the estates there, which I understand would be well worth looking into.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another matter which must be faced by anyone who offers any kind of solution
	<span class='label label-info column'>2352</span>
to this problem is the question of priorities. It is not reasonable to say about anything that it must have the same priority as something else. If one is talking about priority one must say what should come first.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Emrys Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Lord John Hope) is contradicting him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord John Hope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I disagree with a certain emphasis in the speech of the hon. Member that does not lessen the value of his speech, nor my view of it. I can speak only for myself, but I would put only the defence of this country above housing at the moment. That has to be done. I would give housing priority over the Health Service and over education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wanted to be quite sure that the hon. Member was completely supporting the Government's policy. That is all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If there were a pocket of unemployment in a rural area, where unsanitary slums are often found, and with no houses built since house building by municipal authorities was undertaken in Scotland, would the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord John Hope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the example conflicts with my system of priority, and it is only a question of deciding the issue on the merits. I do not think there is anything between us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to end where I began, namely, on a bi-partisan basis. Unless this problem is solved—it cannot be solved in a short time by a Government of any complexion but it must be obvious that we are on the way to a solution fairly soon—it is possible that hon. Members on each side of the Committee will live to see the end of our free society.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McInnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Member for Pent-lands (Lord John Hope) must forgive me if I say that I felt he had got into difficulties in trying to determine the order of his priority. I see the motive underlying his suggestion about priority, but I think he would agree with me that there should be a complete ban on all forms of building except housing and the essential social services. I have expressed that view many times.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also agree with hon. Members who indicated that in their view housing was the most serious and outstanding social problem that this country has to face. That being so, I naturally assumed that any criticism of the existing policy that was to be made would be criticism of a
	<span class='label label-info column'>2354</span>
positive and constructive character. In order to get that positive criticism I carefully analysed the speech of the hon. and gallant Member for Pollok (Commander Galbraith). He began his speech, which he delivered very effectively indeed, by making a comparison as between the rate of building in the three years preceding the war and the three years 1948, 1949 and 1950. I could not appreciate the significance of that comparison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would have been better if he had given a comparison for the whole of the inter-war period, when in over 20 years something like 337,000 houses were built, an annual average not of 24,000 houses, as was indicated by the hon. and gallant Member for the three years immediately preceding the war, but of 16,850 houses. If a rate of 24,000 houses a year had been the average for each year in the inter-war period, in Scotland today there would have been 153,000 more houses, which would probably have broken the back of the housing problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one wants to make a proper comparison of the immediate post-war periods following the First World War and the Second World War, it will be seen that for the first ten years the average of the Tory Government was only in the region of 12,000 houses, despite the fact that there was no restriction on materials or labour. Incidentally, the interjection of the right hon. and gallant Member for Kelvingrove (Lieut.-Colonel Elliot) at our last meeting was completely destroyed by the excellent speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Leith (Mr. Hoy).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel Elliot</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But the hon. Member will agree that the hon. Member for Leith (Mr. Hoy) agreed with my figures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McInnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. and gallant Member made an interjection to observe that the 1935 position had been remedied in later years. I should like to remind him that even in 1938 trainees in the building and plastering industries were being transferred to Croydon, of all places, for work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel Elliot</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And the hon. Member knows well that that was because the building unions would not allow them to work in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>2355</span>
ployment of the kind for which they were trained. They had to write to their Glasgow Members and indicate to them that all they were being offered in Croydon was work as ice-cream vendors. That was the position existing in 1938.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel Elliot</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member will agree that if they had been allowed to stay in Scotland they would have got work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McInnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The fact is, they could not get work in Scotland and had to go to Croydon. The hon. and gallant Member for Pollock made what I consider a most astonishing statement. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The trouble is that I cannot find that we have made much improvement; certainly not in recent years. There was a considerable improvement until 1935,…."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 3rd July, 1951; c. 9.]</p></blockquote>
Surely, the hon. and gallant Member knows—and if he does not all he has to do is to accept the figures given by the hon. Member for Woodside (Mr. Bennett) in our last housing debate—that there were ample houses in Glasgow in 1919.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the survey made in 1935, contained in the Report entitled, " Planning Our Homes," it states that in Glasgow in 1935, after sixteen years of Tory rule, there was a problem of 84,000 houses required, whereas 16 years before, there was no housing problem at all. By 1942 that problem had extended to 100,000 houses required. No Member of the Opposition can attach any blame to the present Government for that situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

as a minimum. What is going to be the Scottish proportion of that 300,000? It may be, of course, that that was just a pious resolution passed by a Conference that persisted in overriding the caution of the leaders. I think it was the hon. and gallant Member for Pollok who said, "Let us have a figure that the electors can grasp."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Commander Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was no snap decision at all. It was something which was well worked out and was possible in our opinion. What I said was that the industry must have a figure to work to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McInnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It must have been so well worked out, if I accept the Press reports, that there was great enthusiasm when Lord Woolton stepped forward to the microphone and said, "This is magnificent.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Emrys Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can help my hon. Friend. He talks about the caution of the Leader.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McInnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In all seriousness, I want to know what is going to be Scotland's share of the 300,000 houses? And how are we to reach any figure that may be suggested as our proportion? Perhaps I could help the Conservative Front Bench if I were to quote from the Paper "Conservative Approach," which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We shall attain this target if we can obtain a further 145,000 standards of timber; if we can produce a further 2,000 million more bricks; if by economies we can find more cement; if we can get more men into the industry; and if we could raise the efficiency of the industry."</p></blockquote>
"If ifs and ands were pots and pans "—everyone knows the rest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a fantastic statement, almost as fantastic as the statement of the right hon. and gallant Gentleman the Member for Kelvingrove in April, when he said that the Socialists in the Glasgow Corporation did not leave a single prepared site for the Progressives when they came into power. May I give him some figures that will enlighten him? When the Socialists lost power in Glasgow in 1949 there were 5,963 houses under construction and there were sites serviced for 2,379 houses, the houses not having been commenced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1950-1951V000P0I1221">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2357</span>
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might interest the right hon. Gentleman to know that when the hon. Lady the Member for Coatbridge and Airdrie (Mrs. Mann) took the convenorship of the Glasgow Corporation Housing Department in 1933, after the Progressives had lost power, she was faced with the problem of having only 1,201 houses in preparation and sufficient land for only 3,900 houses. Let hon. Members compare those figures with the figures when the Socialists lost power, when there were 9,823 houses in preparation and sufficient land for 18,087 houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having dealt with the party opposite, I want to ask my right hon. Friend one or two questions. In my submission the building industry is the most backward of all industries in this country. As has been pointed out, there are 60,000 firms who employ not a single person and over 40,000 who employ only from one to five operatives. These are the national figures; I have no sources available to give me the Scottish percentage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to know what has been the increase in the number of firms who employ from one to 500 operatives. I understand that in 1930 there were only 52,000 such firms in the whole country. In 1949 that number had increased to 72,500. It seems to me that these small firms are one of the reasons why we use labour and material resources which could be better concentrated on housing. I should like my right hon. Friend to indicate the position with regard to the number of firms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further, I want to know what is the position of the industry in Scotland with regard to the intake of labour in order to meet the annual deterioration and depreciation which naturally occurs. Is there any scheme of training or apprenticeship in preparation in Scotland which will act as a feeder to the building industry? What is the system of recruitment? As I understand it, the building council's apprenticeship training scheme does not apply to Scotland, and I think we are entitled to be assured that there is a sufficient and effective method to act as a feeder.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to know, too, what is being done about research. Is use being made of the building research station at East Kilbride? If so, what suggestions have they to offer
	<span class='label label-info column'>2358</span>
by way of prefabrication of lay-out, size and all the rest of it? I think the Committee are entitled to ask whether the full services of this station are being used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Coat-bridge and Airdrie referred to housing costs. I served on the Housing Costs Commission. Perhaps I may quote from a statement by the Chairman of Mowlem's, perhaps the biggest building undertaking in the country. He says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I do not know of a material used in housing in which the selling price or manufacture is not controlled by a combine, by a ring, or by other selling arrangements and, generally speaking, its distribution as well."</p></blockquote>
What action have the Scottish Office taken about these price rings? It is true that today building materials cost three times as much as they did in 1939, possibly even more. What action have the Department taken on this question? The Department are, of course, aware that the Palmer Commission and the Simon Commission both dealt with the building material industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, since many hon. Members have referred to a scheme of incentive payments I want to say, quite categorically, that the stumbling block to the development of such a scheme in Scotland has been the Master Builders' Federation. I understand that some form of agreement has been reached. I ask the Department, how many schemes of incentive payments are in operation in Scotland? This is what the building industry working party had to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In 1949 we made a survey of 163 contracts and the results are of considerable interest. The conclusions drawn concerning the effects of incentive payments on productivity and costs were a saving in many ways which more than off-set the additional labour costs resulting from the payment of bonuses. We have received evidence from various sources indicating that incentive schemes have been a means of increasing productivity and lowering costs."</p></blockquote>
If that is the evidence collated by a Commission who sat for two and a half years and interviewed every element within the industry, then I suggest that one of the first jobs we have to tackle is that of incentive payments schemes. There is evidence here that 163 contracts were analysed and, in them, building costs have been reduced. I hope that when the Joint Under-Secretary of State replies he will deal with the points I have made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Committee proceeds I think it is my duty to intimate that when we next meet as a Committee we shall do so in Committee Room 14 upstairs. This room is shortly to be used for an exhibition in connection with the Festival of Britain. I make that announcement now in order that it may be well known and so that Members do not come here on Tuesday morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. W. G. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have listened with very great interest to the Member for Coatbridge and Airdrie (Mrs. Mann), having a wonderful time, as usual, in the skittle alley. She has put up the dollies and she has knocked them down. She has great experience in that line. But we are here today to face the question of housing—what we are to do as a Committee and how we expect to deal with the difficulties of the next ten years. It is no good at all going back and making an apologia for what has happened between 1920 and 1949. What the people in Scotland want to know is what we Members, who are sent here to represent them, intend to do about the problem which will face us in the years ahead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I submit that not only will the next ten years be difficult, but that we must also deal with the priorities here and now. Under the old formula we are getting only eleven-eightieths for Scotland, representing Scotland's share—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think we must demand at least four times that figure as our share of the available material. If we can use it we should demand the right to have it. The further South one gets the less is the necessity for a substantial house, because there is a great difference between conditions in Scotland and conditions in England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been told today, and we were told on Tuesday, that the time to build is the time of unemployment. It was said that in a time of full employment we require all the labour we have for rearmament and other things. I submit to the Committee that we cannot build houses in times of unemployment. We were told only yesterday by the Chancellor of the Exchequer that it will be very difficult for us under full employment to find the necessary foreign exchange for the essentials which we require. If
	<span class='label label-info column'>2360</span>
it is difficult in times of full employment to buy what we require, how can we find the foreign exchange in times of unemployment and fewer exports? The conclusion is obvious: this is the best chance, when we have maximum exports, to demand that the essentials which we require—timber from Scandinavia and other supplies—should become number one priority for Scotland. We can do without lots of things, but we require houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hear on all hands that the welfare services cannot be touched. We must remember that housing is a number one welfare service. The first requisite of every family is food and the second requisite is a house. All other things come after that. We should have no problems to speak of in the way of providing increased sanatoria accommodation, or in the way of the demand for old folks' homes, if we had more houses. In fact, a dozen of the claimants for building resources today would practically disappear if we could solve the housing problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today we find that a son-in-law or daughter cannot take an aged parent in with them because they have no room. If they had a room in the house, then in most cases the aged parent would live with them in either the son's house or the daughter's house. If we solved that part of the problem there would be no necessity to put up so many houses for aged people. They have about thirty in Glasgow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been told that over 60,000 people are classified as small builders. That was stated by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Central (Mr. McInnes). But these 60,000 are not builders at all, they are really maintenance men. Glasgow Corporation employ over 1,000 maintenance employees to look after 73,000 houses. In other words, one man goes out every day looking after 73 houses. In that case, we shall find that the figure of 60,000 small builders all over the country does not amount to so very much —and they are absolutely necessary for the maintenance of the property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It does no good to think back to 1919 when Glasgow had over 1,000 empty houses—first-class houses. To-day we require 100,000. The hon. Member for Leith (Mr. Hoy) suggested that we might
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1950-1951V000P0I1223">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2361</span>
build on sites where there is either derelict property or property which should be condemned or shortly would be condemned. That is what they are proposing to do in Glasgow. If we do that, however, the Government must realise that such work needs steel or heavy baulk timber. We cannot build substantial tenements with the same light material as that which we use for semidetached or light, terraced houses. That is why local authorities at the moment are almost entirely confined to the light class of property. We have to press on with the demand for the materials which will allow the local authorities to build the houses they need, and which are such a pressing necessity in every burgh in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We heard that Edinburgh had been a bit delinquent in the building of houses —that she might have built more. But what has been Edinburgh's loss has been Glasgow's gain. Hon. Members will be glad to know that at the moment Glasgow has more houses under construction than at any period in her history. At the present time, she has 7,500 houses under construction, and, therefore, it does not do for the Socialists, the Progessives or the Conservatives to pat themselves on the back.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the moment we have a Labour Government at Westminster and, if we like to call it such, a Tory Government at George Square. The Tory Government are breaking all records in house building in Glasgow. If the Labour Government at Westminster want to take the credit, I am the first one to give it to them. They have been most helpful and have given credit where credit was due to the local convenor and his Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To sum up, now is the time to go ahead with our programme and to insist on being given the materials we require. Now is the time to make our demand on the national Exchequer, for what we know Scotland needs. I am quite certain that most of the local authorities, if they—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has been making a good speech and has tried to make a very realistic approach to the problem, but one thing which I find disturbing, and which might cause con-
	<span class='label label-info column'>2362</span>
fusion among those in Scotland who have an interest in our debate is his use of figures. He said that in Scotland we were building 11/ 80ths of the number of houses being built in Great Britain. That is untrue. He also said that Scotland wants four times that amount—in other words, 44 /80ths. His party have said that they will build 300,000 houses a year in Great Britain. Is the hon. Gentleman expressing a point of view acceptable to his hon. Friends, and is he now telling the people of Scotland that the Tories would build 165,000 houses in Scotland? I wonder where on earth the labour and material would come from to build those houses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am saying that 25,000 is, roughly, the number of houses allotted to Scotland this year. I say that we ought to demand four times that number. The requirement is there. Of course, it might be said that we cannot do it, but it is rather surprising that the Glasgow Corporation, with all their difficulties, are well ahead with their programme. They were allowed to build 4,000 houses this year—the allowance was granted on 1st March—and out of that number they have at present 2,800 under construction. They were well ahead before they had this fresh start.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The bulk of the houses in Glasgow are being built by direct labour, but there is no doubt at all that if free enterprise were asked to build houses in Glasgow it could considerably step up the 500 which it has been allowed to build. What we have to do is to see that the material is there and to give direct labour, the local authorities and the free enterprise builders a chance, and we shall be astonished what Scotland can do in the way of housebuilding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Member for Woodside (Mr. Bennett) will forgive me if I do not follow too closely the arguments he has been putting forward, and which were rather more domestic to Glasgow. I want to try in the time at my disposal to take rather a wider view, and not to deal too much in figures, because, in my opinion, this housing problem has been thrashed out unceasingly from all points of view. We all know the figures, and we all know what houses have been built in the various periods. Therefore, I do not see that there is any use in repeating them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1950-1951V000P0I1224">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2363</span>
I regard housing as our greatest human problem, and I regard the shocking housing conditions which exist in all parts of Scotland as something completely beyond the pale in a decent society. I am including rural Scotland in this category because I know of instances in some of the most lovely parts of rural Scotland where families are being brought up in intolerable and insanitary conditions, not conducive to the bringing up of children without running the grave risk of losing them from disease.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This problem is with us in different ways throughout the whole of Scotland. I am convinced that as a people and as a nation we can never attain the heights we ought to attain until our people are housed in decent homes. I say advisedly decent homes, because I do not think that the mere provision of a house meets' the point at all. I have been in public life for the past 20-odd years. When I first entered local authority work there was not the realisation among local authority bodies or among the people of the necessity of being in a good house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In taking propaganda up and down Ayrshire, I used to try to convince our own working-class people that they ought to be in decent homes. Very often they would say that they could never afford to pay the rent of a three-apartment house. I think that those of us who have been interested in housing and in a fuller life for the people have at last awakened that spirit, because everyone in Scotland today wants to go into a municipal home, even though many of them are in decent circumstances in a privately-owned tenement. But they still want to get out of them and into a municipal house. Therefore, I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge and Airdrie (Mrs. Mann) that the clamant demand is on a much broader basis than it was at the beginning of that 20-year period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot agree with the party opposite in their plea for more private enterprise in house building. Have they really thought out this problem? For the life of me, I cannot understand how they can claim that they would get a better provision of houses and better built houses if free enterprise were given its head and were told to build. I know that the local authorities with which I have been connected have had to depend on private
	<span class='label label-info column'>2364</span>
enterprise firms taking their schedules, making offers, and the local authorities accepting what they considered were the best tenders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The number of local authority agencies throughout the country who are employing the direct labour principle at all is very small. Therefore, it means that what the Opposition are really saying is—if local authorities are asking private contractors to quote for building their houses—that when the local authorities allocate the contracts, these people are not pulling their weight; that, in some way or other, if we were to allow the private contractor to build of his own volition he would be able to produce more houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, we could argue along those lines, but we must come back to what has been said in all quarters of the Committee that, after all, the housing need is the more clamant factor. Surely, if we are to rehouse the people who need it most, those in sub-tenancies and in overcrowded conditions or insanitary buildings, it must be done by the selection of the tenants with the greatest need and not merely on the basis that some people want a better house and are prepared to buy it. I think we would be completely unChristian if we put forward that point of view in the present housing crisis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a little diminution in adherence to that principle by the Government during the past year. We did augment by a trickle the number of houses that could be built for sale, but I do not think we should go any further on that road. It aroused a very proper resentment among people living in overcrowded and insanitary conditions in rented houses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. G. D. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But would not the hon. Gentleman agree that it would be better to allow houses to be built for sale if by that means the total number built could be increased? That is our contention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Immediately the hon. Member can prove to me that our labour and material resources in Scotland are such that we can allocate the materials and somewhere find the labour that is at present unemployed to build the additional houses I will agree with him. Failing that, I do not agree because I do not know of any labour that is unemployed.

This problem has been with me all my adult life, and I do not agree that the mere profit motive in house building is the right motive for solving this problem. We must recognise the problem as a social evil and recognise that to provide houses is a social service. No one on the other side of the Committee would argue that we ought privately to provide pavements and roads or that a profit should be made out of the water we drink from taps in our houses. They would not dream of that, but it has not always been so with them and I hope that ultimately we shall have a united front when the social consciousness will be strong enough to look at the housing problem in the same way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The party opposite, while saying that we should have more private enterprise building and more houses for sale, were throughout the last election campaign arguing for reduced Government expenditure, which obviously could have come only from some cut in the social services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. and gallant Gentleman is prepared to devote some of his surplus wealth to help the Government well and good. I am sorry, Mr. Mathers, that I was led astray as usual by the hon. and gallant Member.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to deal with old property, a subject with which the hon. and gallant Member for Pollok (Commander Galbraith) also dealt in opening the debate. This is an intriguing problem. First, we have to recognise that the local authorities and the central agency of Government will need to be very careful in what they recognise as property suitable for reconstruction or renovation. Not only in our large cities but in many of our small burghs and in areas where villages are of any extent at all, there is old property which has been built completely without regard to planning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Very often houses were built where they ought not to have been built. They were far too congested. There were not enough green drying places and no back doors. In some areas that I know the people upstairs can only dry clothes on the wash-house roofs. It would be a crime to give Government grants for the renovation of property of that type. We must recognise that all this property has been built without planning because the
	<span class='label label-info column'>2366</span>
profit motive was the only motive that caused houses to be erected. The streets were too narrow and far too congested. We cannot agree to give Government subsidies 	<i>ad lib.,</i> as the hon. and gallant Member for Pollok suggested, or modify the Rent Restriction Acts to allow higher rents to be charged for these places.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am becoming increasingly disturbed about what is happening in my own constituency, and generally throughout Ayrshire. I am assured that things are just the same in Glasgow and in other areas of Scotland where tenement houses become unoccupied and the landlords leave them unoccupied to attract sale because of the helplessness of many of our people in that they cannot qualify for municipal houses. It is only because people cannot get municipal houses that they contract debts and hang millstones round their necks to buy these old properties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. G. D. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the hon. Member explain why it is that it is only now the owners want to sell these houses? Why not before?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because they are now in a position in which these houses are a very good selling article. This is a most favourable period because of the scarcity, and because we are not doing what the owners were always frightened that we would do, namely, take such controls as are necessary to prevent the exploitation of these poor people. Unfortunately, we as a Government are not facing this problem and it is becoming increasingly evident that unless we face it there will be such repercussions in the localities that we will be compelled to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must tackle this selling of houses. In the main, all the houses that become vacant today only become vacant because of the initiative of the local authority and the spending of Government money, in the way of grants and subsidies, to provide new houses. Some insanitary houses which ought not to be sold are being sold, but in the area I know best the houses, though generally they have been overcrowded, are of a fairly good standard as tenement houses go. Through the initiative of local authorities and the expenditure of public money tenants of these places move into new houses, and the local factors, acting
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1950-1951V000P0I1226">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2367</span>
for private landlords, advertise in the local Press, " These properties for sale." They would never have been empty if it had not been for the expenditure of public money and for the initiative of local authorities in housing these people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Prices charged for accommodation are intolerable and unbelievable. In Ayrshire even friends of hon. Members opposite, with their local council controlled by Tories, are saying that they are prepared to support me in any action I take in this connection. Hon. Members opposite should think twice about supporting 	<i>ad lib.</i> the private owners who are grasping this opportunity to try to recoup losses. Those losses would not have occurred had they been businesslike, since they first started to realise profits, in putting aside an adequate sum for repairs just as the local authorities have to do. They have not done that. Instead they have often taken 100 per cent. of the income from these properties as profits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will not classify all the owners as bad. There is the good owner who tries to keep his property in good repair, but I find it difficult to obtain any evidence of what the hon. and gallant Member for Pollok said about the expenditure of money on repairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People tell me that repairs are not done at all, and that if they want a pane of glass or a washer on a tap or window cords they have to spend their own money. They even have to do plaster work. The hon. Member for Govan (Mr. Browne) spoke of providing tenants with plaster, paint, nails and so on, to patch up some of this property, but I do not know what the old lady in the top flat whom he mentioned would do about filling a hole in the ceiling. Money claimed to be spent on repairs by the owners is not always so spent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Commander Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member argues too much one way. I deplore the terrific price it is necessary to pay to obtain any accommodation whatever at the present time, and he will know that this hits people on this side of the Committee just as much as it hits those on his side. The hon. Member must realise the colossal cost of repairs today. I will give him a simple instance.
	<span class='label label-info column'>2368</span>
Where a new range has to be installed it costs £65, and for many of these houses the rental is only £10 a year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those ranges are not being put into those houses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Commander Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can give the hon. Member cases where they are. I guarantee that if the hon. Member had been losing money on house property year after year and he had the opportunity to get rid of his liability he would take that opportunity. It is not true that we are all robbers. We are all Scots. and we are trying to do the best we can.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and gallant Member for Pollok has made a quite extended interruption. I hope it will not tempt the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel), who has the Floor, to extend his speech unduly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask whether my speech is to be limited in any way by some direction from the Chair in contrast to the speeches of other hon. Members?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There has been no limitation of anyone. My criticism was of the length of the interruption by the hon. and gallant Member for Pollok, and I hoped the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire would not take undue advantage of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. and gallant Member for Pollok (Commander Galbraith) would not mind listening instead of trying to convert my hon. Friend the Joint Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. T. Fraser) I should like to reply to his interruption. I indicated that there were some good landlords, and that they would try to carry out some repairs to the extent that that was possible. But do not let us forget that we find it difficult to secure any evidence of repairs being carried out. As to stoves and ranges and things of that kind being installed, I am afraid I cannot find in my constituency any proof of that at all. It is all very well for the hon. and gallant Member for Pollok to try to dismiss the subject by saying that if I were in the position of having to pay large sums for repairs I would realise the property in the present conditions, which are favourable because of fall employment.

I do not think we ought to start the story there. I think we should go back to when the house was built, and consider the rent it has gathered in the course of its 60 or 100 years of existence; and not look at it from the point of view that somebody has been so unbusinesslike as to buy a house in the last ten years. They should have a vote of no confidence passed, against them, because they should have known what they were doing. I do not think that the public purse ought to rescue them because they have made a mistake. I hope we shall have some real contribution from the Secretary of State as to how best this issue can be met, because there is a body of opinion building up in Scotland which will not tolerate this much longer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As one who has examined the problem over a long time, I disagree profoundly with the contention of my hon. Friend the Member for Leith (Mr. Hoy) regarding the building of houses adjacent to where people are working. He mentioned the docks. I agree with him that in many of the built-up areas in our cities we should exploit to the full opportunities to build fiats which are excellent for city dwellers. But we should not be prepared to perpetuate the, terrific wrong done to our people by forcing them to bring up their people on the dock-side. I do not consider that is right. There they are breathing the iron-ore dust and the houses are too filthy for any housewife to keep clean. When I was a councillor in Ardrossan I had complaints from people living several streets removed from the harbour area that they could never keep their houses clean because of the iron-ore dust and the cement dust and things of that kind which percolated through the windows and doors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We never find the managerial class who own the docks, or manage them, or who occupy the higher executive posts ever living in these dock areas. They live in the more salubrious areas, and I am claiming the same right for our people to bring up their families in just as healthy surroundings as these other families. I think my hon. Friend was a little off the track when he said that we should perpetuate the old method of building near the docks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hoy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not suggesting that, and I thought I made it perfectly clear,
	<span class='label label-info column'>2370</span>
that I did not want the old type of building right on the docks. But there are areas adjacent to the docks, and by that I do not mean right on top of them, where houses might be built. I do not want to see us reverting to the foul old slum type of tenement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad my hon. Friend has made that clear. I think we should rid ourselves of our fear of the word "prefabrication." I do not know of a house which is not prefabricated, because the brick is itself a prefabricated unit. I am convinced that there are some types of prefabrication which are excellent and which we should utilise to the full, but many housing components are far too costly. The Government should pay some attention to whether or not they should control these components at the source of supply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would appear that immediately we get some type of prefabrication and adopt it, supplies run out, or there is a hold-up, and it is months before we can get on with the job. We have taken over a big legacy from the past, on which I do not like to dwell too much. We have taken over a great deal of jerrybuilding. While we can claim that we have built many more houses than the Tories did, I do not think that is a proper claim to make. Everyone expected us to do better than the Tories and that is why they returned us. I do not consider that is anything to boast about, because the Tories never had any standard so far as the provision of houses is concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask my right hon. Friend to do everything possible to get better housing production in Scotland, but at the same time do not let us depart one iota from the standards which we have built up over the past 20 years, because if we do there will be a complete revolt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have listened to what might be described as an amiable discourse by the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel), which has extended over a substantial number of minutes. At intervals there seems to be some real material appearing into which one could get one's teeth, if not one's trowel on to, but every time there seemed to be something substantial emerging it slipped away.

I agree with the hon. Member about the serious nature of the problem of individual rooms and little flats and tenement buildings, and I hoped that he would produce a solution. My hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Pollok (Commander Galbraith) put the problem into its proper perspective. There are very few landlords left who can afford to keep up their houses properly, and it is no use saying one should look back for 50 or 100 years and say there ought to have been a proper fund built up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Properties have changed hands. There are such things as Death Duties and taxation. There are daughters, and granddaughters and great-granddaughters to be provided for. I have investigated some of these cases where I felt the landlord was failing miserably to do his job and I have found from the factor that the landlord was holding the property on trust for a granddaughter or that there was no income and no money—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Member suggest that when he sells one of his ships which has become an old crock it should fetch four times what it originally cost to build?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must confess that one of the secrets of survival in the shipping industry is that one watches the trade cycle and tries to do just that, but it does not always work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One point the hon. Member made was that private enterprise builders are building houses, and if we are not getting the results does not that mean they are not pulling their weight? That links up with a remark made by the Secretary of State on Tuesday, which struck me. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The truth, I repeat, is—and it is the essence of our difficulty—that every reputable contractor, every man who can deliver a job,
	<span class='label label-info column'>2372</span>
conform to a standard and approximate to a time-table, is fully committed."—[OFFICIAL, REPORT, 	<i>Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 3rd July, 1951; c. 20.]</p></blockquote>
He was using that argument, as was the hon. Member, to show that private enterprise cannot do any more. That argument may be all very well if the Secretary of State or any hon. Member of this Committee can cross his heart and say he is convinced that the available resources and man-power are being used to the best advantage. At this moment, when we are talking about priorities, and when there may have to be allocations because of the re-armament programme and various shortages, can we be satisfied that all the available resources are being used to the best advantage?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Leith (Mr. Hoy) told us about the convenor of the Housing Committee in Edinburgh who said that though they had the material and labour and plans yet results were not forthcoming. Does not it occur to hon. Members opposite that the whole theory on which they have approached this matter since 1945 has been utterly and completely wrong? I know the difficulty of planning and pushing materials to the right place, and at this moment it is very difficult to change that system just for a temporary period. But the real weight of my criticism of the Labour Party is that during the critical years 1947, 1948 and 1949, instead of allowing free flexibility to the Scottish building industry they kept a tightly restrictive control of allocation and planning, and imposed all sorts of other difficulties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
