	<p>10.31 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Henderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The subject to which we particularly wish to draw attention this morning is the problem of rates. This debate takes place in what is in one sense a happy time for Scotland but in another sense, in terms of what is happening with Scottish rates, it is a bleak and unpleasant one for some people. We are faced with a cascade of unprecedented rate rises in Scotland at the present time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In recent weeks my hon. Friends and I have been worrying the Secretary of State for Scotland and asking Questions to try to get some preliminary information about what would happen at this time of the year. We sought to make the right hon. Gentleman think about these problems before they actually arose. It seems to me that in the replies that we have had we have met with a great deal of insensitivity and, some of us suspect, almost indifference. Our impression has been that it was felt we were moaning about something that was not very important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that there will be no impression of moaning from this side of the Committee this morning. I hope that our message will be much louder than that, and much more positive. The anxieties which we have been trying to express over recent weeks are being replaced by howls of anguish from the ratepayers as the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>110</span>
facts are now emerging in the various burghs and counties throughout Scotland. The Government took office with a pledge to extract howls of anguish from the rich, but the howls of anguish are coming from a far wider section of the community than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I can illustrate some of the problems that immediately confront us by referring to the problems in my own constituency, I am sure that other hon. Members will be able to bring similar facts before the Committee this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Dunbartonshire, the increase in rates is about one-third. For every pound that was paid in rates last year, another 30p will be paid this year. This is a staggering rise. As it happens, about 17p of the 29p increase in the rate poundage is on the housing deficit. Bearsden has announced a domestic rate increase of 10p in the pound. That, by any traditional standard, is a staggering increase. In old terms, it is 2s. in the pound, yet there was a time when rates were not so very much more than that in total—[	<i>Interruption</i>].
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not as young as some hon. Gentlemen think I am!
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think hon. Members will agree that a 10p increase in the rate poundage a few years ago would have been held to be quite remarkable, yet by the standards of today, in the west of Scotland, this is a very modest increase indeed, which reflects considerable credit on that town council. But the fact that the increase of 10p in the pound in Bearsden is modest by other standards in the west of Scotland is little comfort for the large number of newly married couples and retired people who live there and who will have to face these substantial increases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Cumbernauld Town Council met to decide its rates, it was so horrified with the facts that it could not bring itself to announce what the rates should be this year. Instead, it has sought a meeting with the Secretary of State for Scotland. In that context, I hope that the Minister will encourage his right hon. Friend to meet Cumbernauld Town Council. I hope that there will be some thoroughgoing straight talking over the issues which confront the town.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever the reasons for the particular problem in Cumbernauld which made the town council decide that it needed to increase the rates—some people feel that the council spends too much time discussing matters which are not of immediate
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0282">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>111</span>
concern to its ratepayers—the ratepayers there will clearly be hit very hard. I hope that the Secretary of State will not be carried away by any political bias when he meets the town council, and that he will seek to help it in any way that he can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For many years I have advocated—so far without success—that special assistance should be given to local authorities which have new towns in their areas. There is a substantial increase in infrastructure—of schools in particular, but also other services—which the local authorities have to provide as the town expands and develops. This places a heavy burden on existing ratepayers before the new ratepayers come along to play their part in carrying these burdens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think had that principle been established for the substantial new development that is taking place as a result of the actions of central Government, it would have helped the situation considerably. I understand this is happening in the northeast of Scotland, where actions outwith the control of Government but in which central Government play a considerable role, have created a situation that local authorities, in order to develop the necessary services, are having to carry a heavy burden on the rates, just as has been the case with local authorities in which new towns have been established.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Kirkintilloch normally announces its rates in August. I am afraid, therefore, that I do not have the figures for that burgh but the county requisition for the burgh has been increased by 20 per cent. this year. When one remembers that the county requisition is the largest part of that burgh's expenditure, one realises that this will have a major impact on the rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other staggering figure is the 71 per cent. increase—nearly three-quarters—in the requisition from the Greater Glasgow Passenger Transport Authority. With increases such as these and with what is happening elsewhere, it is small wonder that the Kirkintilloch ratepayers are awaiting their fate with some trepidation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to say a word about this Greater Glasgow Passenger Transport Authority. It is causing much unrest among my own constituents and probably among those of other hon. Members. I understand that the Glasgow PTA was set up following legislation by the previous
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>112</span>
Labour Government. There is great anger and resentment among my constituents that they are paying through the nose for a service from which they receive no benefit. Secondly, they are angered by the fact that, having seen no benefit, they now face staggering rises over which they have no control whatsoever. I hope that the Minister will address his mind to the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past I have not been in this House and therefore I am in no position to criticise or defend the records of previous Governments to any extent. But having looked at these matters from outside as a ratepayer—one has to declare an interest—one has felt that previous Conservative Governments have expressed in action a genuine concern for the ratepayers. Perhaps the most important measure to help the ratepayer was the rate rebate scheme which will come into effect this year. It will help about 300,000 people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rates programme has been consistently increased by Conservative Governments despite the fact that it stagnated in the latter years of the previous Labour Government. We particularly gave help to the domestic ratepayer. In 1973–74, we saw from a Conservative Government the greatest increase in the percentage of grant to reckonable expenditure since rate support grant began.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We start from the point, if we are speaking of party records, that Conservative Governments have shown themselves to be particularly sensitive over the years—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Lawson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman is making this point, and making it so strongly, may I remind him that one of the first Bills brought in by the Conservative Government regarding rates in Scotland was a Bill to relieve the farming industry of the payment of any rates whatsoever on its industrial buildings?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Quite right, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 1 t is also a fact that industry is derated by 50 per cent. in Scotland because of the heavy level of the rates in order to ensure that it is not placed at a disadvantage with its competitors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0283">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>113</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is more to come. I should like to point out one or two things which reflect on the policies of this Government and of the Labour Party and which have had an effect on the ratepaying situation. We had a Budget this year—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We had four last year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—and I am told that we are to have more because of some of the classic blunders in the first one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are told by the Treasurer of Glasgow Corporation—who I do not think is known to be a Tory—that the rate poundage in Glasgow will have lip added to it as a direct result of the Budget because of increases in National Insurance, postal and telephone charges. That does not include higher electricity charges, heavier taxes of one kind and another which are increasing wage pressures, or the increased costs in the building industry which Glasgow ratepayers will also suffer. It would not be pushing it too far to say that the real effect of the Budget on Glasgow's rates is much more likely to be about 5p in the pound.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should have taken steps some time ago to ensure that the ratepayers would be shielded against the rate of inflation which is now escalating faster than ever before. It is not helpful to the ratepayer to introduce a rent freeze by Government action if the Government do not pay for it. The result is that one robs Peter to pay Paul, and everyone pays more on the rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other matter, which is the fault not of Ministers but of some of their friends in the country, is that a large number of Labour councils will not accept any reasonable basis of self- discipline at a time of national inflation for which, when Labour Members were in opposition, they were blaming, in a most irresponsible way, the Conservative Government. They were doing nothing themselves to try to shield the people for whom they had direct responsibility from the effects of that inflation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Henderson) started by saying that Dunbartonshire's rates had gone up by 30 per cent. Would he like to state the political complexion of Dunbartonshire County Council. The Labour Party is in the minority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>114</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say 30 per cent.; I said that they had gone up by about a third. Can the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, West (Mr. Campbell) tell me what is the political complexion of Dunbartonshire County Council? I should be very glad to know, as it is a very confusing matter indeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The people who are suffering most from this are those in the county, not the burgh, areas. If one thinks of the political complexion in those areas where the rate burden was the highest—in the Vale of Leven, in Croy, in Twechar in my constituency—one realises that the general representation is certainly not Tory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to speak for too long on the situation confronting us. It is well known to hon. Members, and I am sure that other hon. Members will have more information to give to the committee. The situation which faces us now is this staggering rate rise which is causing great hardship to ordinary people, and it would have been far worse were it not for the rate rebate scheme which was planned by the previous Government. Rate rises are hitting living standards very directly, and they have no relevance whatsoever to the ability of people to pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a second way in which people are being hit more subtly and less obviously and that is by the very heavy level of rates on non-domestic subjects. People will have to pay more for the goods in the shops to help pay for the rates which the shops must pay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lawson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Except farmers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know much about agriculture, but no doubt my hon. Friends who do will deal with that. Hardship and injustice are staring many people in the face, and we want to know now what this Government will do about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a fact that the Government, regrettably, are in the seat of power. The Opposition do have not the power to change the current situation. The Government can do something, or they can do nothing about the situation. Whichever they do, they will have to face the fact that there is a grievance. We are drawing it to their attention, and we want to know what they intend to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the short term, the Government can provide cash, and they can look again at
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0284">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>115</span>
the rate support grant formula, which a number of local authorities believe is not equitable. They can look at the question of the old debts and deficits which will have to be considered with the reorganisation of local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the long term, the Government should be showing some signs of action. In the short term the main thing is to find out what is the problem, where the remaining burdens are falling in local government, and what central Government can do to help. In the longer term, we must look at the relationship between central and local government more carefully. It is not clear to me whether the Secretary of State for Scotland has been consulting the Secretary of State for the Environment about future investigations of rates. I hope that that will be clarified and that Scottish interests on any Committee of inquiry will be carefully looked after.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any long-term change in the rating system, we must recognise that central Government have an overall responsibility for the management of the national economy and that the total expenditure of local government is of crucial importance to that economy. Central Government therefore, must have some control over the total level of local government spending. But we have a long way to go in freeing local government from day-to day waddling up to St. Andrew's House over the most trivial matters. Even if it is only a matter of obtaining borrowing consent for a greenhouse, local government must go to St. Andrew's House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever system is introduced, it must be one in which, when local government knows what money is available, it can get on with spending it in the way that is most beneficial to the ratepayers. In the long term we may, because of the reform of local government, have a clearer opportunity for a radical reappraisal of local government finance. I am for a radical solution, but I recognise that it will be some time before we shall see the total change that I wish to see.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the reasons why rates are a particularly obnoxious form of raising money is that they are non-buoyant, and there is no expenditure in this country as buoyant as that of local government. Local government provides the services. They are personal services, many of which central Government have insisted that local government should provide.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>116</span>
Because they are services, they require people; they are personal and people services. Therefore, because of the rapidly increasing cost of employing a person, local government service costs have risen and will continue to rise more rapidly than those for any other services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local government expenditure has increased much more rapidly than has the wealth of the nation. The financing of that expenditure has been based on a principle which does not allow for greater wealth to be provided naturally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In order to receive more money from the rates, one must increase the rate poundage, whereas in many other taxes the same tax level, because of buoyancy, will produce a greater income as the wealth of the nation rises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to see really substantial sums of money drawn from a tax of this kind, it becomes increasingly clear that the present system cannot be right and fair in the more complicated society of today. In the medium term, the right thing to do to rectify the situation is to share the cost between the Exchequer and local ratepayers. I ask the Minister to consider seriously the possibility of ensuring that after the reorganisation comes into effect rates are used to finance the personal, local services that one sees in this district of politics, and to recognise that most of the regional authority services which are provided by statute or by central Government decree are more properly a charge upon the national Exchequer. It can be done without any loss of local control over the way in which the money is spent. The idea that local initiative can be exercised only if the money is raised locally is not a sound argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today is 4th July, 1974, and it is a significant date. It is my wife's birthday. It is also Independence Day in the United States. It could be made an even more significant date as a result of the debate this morning. Let it be the date on which a Labour Government at last responded to parliamentary pressure and gave substantial help to Scottish ratepayers at a time when they were suffering severely. Let it also be the date on which the Government signalled the beginning of the end of a system which no one likes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.58 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Mr. Bruce Millan)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I first congratulate the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0285">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>117</span>
East (Mr. Henderson) on his introduction to the Front Bench and say quite sincerely that we look forward to hearing him making many more speeches on behalf of the Opposition. The hon. Gentleman made an agreeable speech, if not a wholly accurate one. At least he got the date right, for which his wife appears to have been extremely grateful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want now to take up one or two of the points made by the hon. Gentleman and I shall deal with some of them later. The statutory rents rebate scheme was introduced by the previous Labour Government. The scheme has been modified since then, but it was a Labour Government innovation. The same is true of the reduction in the domestic element of rates. That, too, was an innovation of the previous Labour Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without going into the merits of the hon. Gentleman's criticisms of the Glasgow PTA I must say that there is a shared responsibility in a way. The PTA arose from the 1968 Act, but it was the previous Conservative Government who established it. If there is something wrong with the financial arrangements, it must be said that they were, I recollect, laid down in a statutory instrument produced by the Conservative Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far as financial discipline on local authorities is concerned, I think all of us would accept that we do not want to see local authorities spending money unnecessarily. Having been more than four years in the Scottish Office, I do not recollect receiving even one letter from any Member of Parliament, on either side of the Committee, asking me to cut back on his own local authority's expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But I do remember receiving a constant stream of letters, from among others, the Whip, the hon. Member for Ross and Cromarty (Mr. Gray), who writes to me practically every day asking me to spend more money in Ross and Cromarty. Hundreds of letters come in every year from the Opposition asking the Government to encourage and allow local authorities to spend more money in their constituencies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. J. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope the Minister will look up the OFFICIAL REPORT of the first occasion on which the present Secretary of State answered Parliamentary Questions at the beginning of the present Parliament. I asked him specifically to ensure that we would not
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>118</span>
have the sort of escalation of expenditure by local authorities in Scotland which accompanied the changeover in local government in England. The hon. Gentleman can check and find that that is so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is rather interesting and if the hon. Gentleman will write to me with a list of the projects in South Angus that he wants the Government to cut back on, I will be happy to consider his request. But I must say that such a letter has so far never actually come my way, though I live in hope.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I turn to the general subject of the debate. I realise that rates are an extremely unpopular tax. They are not liked by anyone, and one of the reasons for this as the hon. Gentleman said, is their lack of buoyancy. Increasing demands for local government expenditure for essential services, which we all want to see improved, meanin the absence of an equally buoyant source of revenue, increases in rate poundage. There is general dissatisfaction for that reason, and also because there is considerable feeling--which I think most of us share—that the way in which the rate burden is distributed is not the fairest way in which a taxation burden on the community should fall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present difficulty is caused by inflation. I shall come to that in a moment but I think I should say that some of the large increases that have been announced for England and Wales are unlikely, taking the situation as a whole, to be repeated in Scotland. However, the Scottish position is quite a serious one, as I shall illustrate in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But we must look at the long term and at what the present Government have done by way of initiative, and contrast this with what was done by the previous Government. The previous Government published their Green Paper in 1971, and I think it would be fair to describe it as a useful survey of possible alternatives to local authority finance, accompanied by what seemed to that Government to be compelling reasons why none of those alternatives would do any good. That, I think, is a brief but accurate summary of the 1971 Green Paper. All that the previous Government did about the longer term was to say that, following local government reorganisation, they would look at the problem again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0286">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>119</span>
We recognise that this is a matter which, from the long term point of view, requires to be looked at in a searching way. That is why my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment announced in the House last Thursday the establishment of an independent committee of inquiry with a remit that will enable it to look at all the problems associated with local government finance. The committee will take in Scotland and Wales, as well as England, there will be appropriate Scottish representation of a high quality in the committee, and we hope to get the report from it as soon as possible, but, in the nature of things, and taking into account the difficult problems to be considered, it would be unrealistic to expect a report within a few months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the time is overdue for an independent look at the whole of the rating and local government financial system, and I certainly hope that we shall receive from that committee recommendations which will be generally acceptable, radical, and provide suitable alternatives, not for the complete replacement of the present rating system—it is probably unrealistic to expect that—but for a considerable modification of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the meantime, we are faced with the immediate situation. As regards the rate increases which have been announced in Scotland so far, we are nothing like as far forward in making an overall assessment of the position as compared with England and Wales, for reasons which lie in the statutory timetables in the respective countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the last two or three years, there have been very considerable increases in rates, including the domestic rates, in Scotland. The hon. Gentleman rather gave the impression that domestic ratepayers in Scotland has somehow, under the previous administration, had it rather easy. That is not so. The figures were given in answer to a Question by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor) the other day. They show that in 1969–70 and in 1973–74 there was an increase in the average domestic rates per household of about 50 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are, therefore, facing a continuing problem, despite the fact that over the last two or three years, as with the previous Labour Government, there were increases
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>120</span>
in the percentage of reckonable expenditure provided for by means of rate support grant. Thus, the relative burden falling on the central taxpayer compared with the local taxpayer over those years, as over the years of the Labour Government, continued to increase. Despite that, the domestic ratepayers were paying considerably more rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far as the rates that have been fixed for the current year are concerned, the hon. Gentleman has drawn attention to Dunbartonshire. Among the larger authorities that area shows the highest rate increase up to now. It is impossible at present to say that the overall increase will be a particular figure. As soon as we have these figures, I shall happily make them available to the House. I agree that the increase in rate burden for the domestic ratepayers this year is likely to be higher than we have had in normal circumstances over many years in the past, and I should now like to explain the reasons for this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Teddy Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman be so kind as to admit at least that the Written Answer to which he referred, which I received from the Secretary of State on 25th June, showed that in the four years from 1970 to 1974 the percentage increase in rates in Scotland was about 30 per cent., which is far less than Dunbarton county ratepayers will be paying this year?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Dunbarton county ratepayers are not typical so far as the current year is concerned. The point that I was making was simply that there had been a considerable increase in the rate burden on domestic ratepayers over the period of the previous Government. The rate burden in current inflationary terms will increase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I deal with that point and say what the situation is likely to be over the current year, may I remind the Committee that the rate support grant Order which we introduced was inherited from the previous Government. I say that with no particular pleasure, because I do not consider it a particularly strong argument for a Labour Minister to say that he has done something which the previous Government intended to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make the point to show that it is not really for the Opposition to criticise the present rate support grant Order in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0287">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>121</span>
Scotland because, with certain adjustments which we made which were favourable to local authorities, it is the order which we inherited from the previous Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Henderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The case may be as the Minister describes, but is it not a fact that the situation has changed significantly since that rate support order was drafted? When the Government have the power to change things, if the situation changes they should consider making changes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All I can say is that the inflationary tendencies from which we now suffer were well before the previous Government, just as they are before us. They did not miraculously start at the beginning of March this year, and no hon. Gentleman can seriously sustain that argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Rates go up partly because, even at constant prices, local authorities want to improve their services. We said, as the previous Government did—and again it gives me no particular pleasure to say this—in telling local authorities o; the rate support grant settlement, that we hoped they would use every endeavour to keep real increases in costs down in the current year. In the present economic situation we cannot, unfortunately, afford to have substantial real increases in the services provided by local authorities. I wish that we had not had to say that to the local authorities, but we felt compelled to do so in the present situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I should like to mention one aspect of services which puts a burden on the rates and which was mentioned by the hon. Gentleman; namely, services such as housing. I am quite unrepentant about what the Government did about the rent freeze. I believe that this was overwhelmingly the right thing to do, and it has been recognised as such by local authority council tenants and by private tenants, because it should be remembered that this was done not just for the local authorities but also for the private tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A rent freeze for local authority tenants means that there is an additional burden on the rates, but we have already committed ourselves to providing 80 per cent. of that by Government grant, and in fact we are likely to provide appreciably more than 80 per cent. by way of reimbursement from the Government. So the burden on
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>122</span>
the ratepayer is not likely to be above £1 million—it might be less—and that must be set in perspective against a total rates bill of about £250 million, and total Government grants of about £400 million. To suggest that this action of the Government has any substantial effect on the rates is to get the matter completely out of proportion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important item so far as the current year is concerned is the effect of inflation. I think that the previous Government's calculation was that with the adjustments of rate support grant, and so on, the increase in rates burden in the present year might be about 15 per cent. We inherited this situation. The hon. Member for Cathcart looks surprised, but the fact is that his Government were responsible for the rate support grant Order which we introduced. Of course inflation is an extremely serious problem for the ratepayer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that when the rate support grant Order was introduced a certain element was taken into account for expected increases in cost. It is also true, however, that there are normally rate support grant increase orders later on in the year. It is a convention which, as far as I am aware, is much cherished by the Treasury that Ministers never mention the prospect of a rate support grant increase Order in any year, because this offends the canons of good public finance. I shall forbear from saying that there will definitely be a rate support grant Order in the current year, but I, for one, shall be extremely surprised if there is not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That by itself will not necessarily lessen the burden on the local ratepayer, but it will lessen it in the sense that if it does not come forward the local ratepayer will have to pay even more. Unless one increased the actual percentage of reckonable expenditure for which the Government felt themselves responsible, the ratepayers' share of inflation would have to be borne by the ratepayers. I an being frank with the Committee, because that is the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to say—which Minister would not?—that when we reconsider
these matters later in the year we will reconsider the percentage as well, but 1 see little prospect of that in view of the general economic and financial situation. However, these matters can always be reconsidered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I deal with other matters, and I come first to the effect of local government
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0288">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>123</span>
reorganisation. This has apparently imposed additional burdens on local authorities in England and Wales—for reasons which I do not pretend fully to comprehend—because of the way in which the reorganisation has been carried out—the Act was much attacked by our Labour colleagues south of the border—but we do not see why reorganisation in Scotland should by itself impose considerably increased local authority expenditure.—[	<i>Interruption</i>].
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether that is being disputed, but again it was a Conservative measure, not ours. If there is a dispute about that and a feeling that it will impose many additional burdens, we should like to know about it. I do not remember Mr. Gordon Campbell and his friends telling us this when the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 was going through the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will, of course, be additional expenditure this year for the reorganisation of the new authorities themselves, and there is an obligation on the existing authorities to rate a penny in the pound to provide for reorganisation, and that expenditure of £4 million has already been taken fully into account for rate support grant purposes. But there will be difficulties in the first year of reorganisation, because the rate support grant formula will not produce for each new authority a fair result—or at least it will not produce the same kind of result as the rate support grant formula produces for the existing authorities. A second difficulty is that the new authorities, which will be made up from areas now under the control of other authorities, may impose an overall rateable burden in their areas which, in terms of increase, will fall more harshly on one part of the area than on others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For both those reasons, there will have to be transitional ararngements. The statutory provision has already been made, and all that I can say at this stage is that these matters are due to be discussed between the Government and the local authority 'associations through their various working parties on finance. I hope that we shall be able to produce acceptable changes that will take care of the inevitable transitional difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Looking to the future, we have set up this longer-term inquiry, and the Government hope that there will be radical proposals from it for changes in local government finance. But, in the current
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>124</span>
year, we have done what we can through the rate support grant Order to take care of the present situation. Clearly we are looking seriously at the continuing situation and, as far as transitional arrangements for next year are concerned, I hope that we shall be able to produce solutions to any problems that may arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact remains that rates are an unpopular form of taxation. They will be particularly unpopular in the current year because of the inflation which is not the responsibility of this Government but which we are determined to bring under control as rapidly as possible. It is in the interests of the community as a whole and of ratepayers that we should succeed in our anti-inflationary policy because, unless we do, then they as ratepayers, and all of us as citizens, are likely to suffer badly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that we shall be able to bring inflation under control and I hope that, in the longer-term. we shall be able to produce more radical proposals which will once-and-for-all get rid of so many of the inherent unfairnesses and injustices which we admit are in the rating system.

Several hon. Members 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. In view of the large number of hon. Members who are anxious to take part in the debate. I invite hon. Members who catch my eye to keep their eyes on the clock rather than on the Chairman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.20 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir John Gilmour</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I begin by joining the Minister of State in congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Henderson) on the way in which he opened this debate, and then by taking up straight away one or two of the things that the Minister of State said about local government reorganisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would it, for instance, be possible to take out the once-and-for-all expenditure caused by local government reorganisation and treat it separately, so that it is not fudging the books for the next year?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My county of Fife is the only one, thanks to the good sense of the Scottish Standing Committee, that is maintained within its own boundaries and which has had the number of authorities reduced and become a regional authority with three districts. I suggest that that is a good yardstick to see whether extra expenditure
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0289">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>125</span>
has taken place as a result of reorganisation. In every other case, one comes to the situation that the boundaries are altered and one is therefore not comparing like with like.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of us who took part in the debates on the reorganisation of local government were very unhappy that we were unable to have a change in the rating system at the same time. Opinions were expressed on both sides of the Committee during those debates to that effect. Since then we have had a vote in the House of Commons which says that something drastic and immediate ought to be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that the Government have set up a committee of inquiry, but this will take time. Is there not something that we can do straight away? For some years I have advocated that certain items of expenditure which at the moment are being paid partly through rates and partly through Exchequer grants should go to the Exchequer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first item is school teachers' salaries. These are negotiated on a national basis, and the local authorities have no say as to the level of those salaries. It would be very much better if the whole of these salaries were paid by the Exchequer. It might also be possible at the same time to have a slightly higher proportion of other educational expenditure paid for by the ratepayers, as they then would be controlling it themselves and would therefore have a greater liability to foot the bill for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An exception that ought to be made was mentioned by my hon. Friend; namely, expenditure on education in new towns. I know, for instance, that when the expansion of the new town of Glenrothes was taking place it was often necessary in the interests of economy to build a whole school because if it was built in pieces it would make it more expensive. It was, however, impossible to have that building fully utilised for the first two or three years after it was built. This made it more difficult for school extensions to be made in other parts of the education authority's area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the question of the whole of the fire service and police being paid for by the national Exchequer. I noticed the other day that fire tenders had to come from all over Scotland to Grangemouth, and when there was trouble at the Longannet power station during the coal miners'
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>126</span>
strike two or three years ago, police from all over Scotland were drafted in to control affairs there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One finds that, with the pattern of reorganisation of local government that has been brought in, one regional authority covers half the population of Scotland and that half these services are being paid for in the main in Scotland by one particular authority. Therefore, it does not seem to be a very drastic step to take these expenditures and put them wholly on to the Exchequer, and, as a result, relieve the ratepayers and also ensure that they have a better means of control over the expenditure which they really can influence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another alternative which is worth considering. We should amend the present rating law so that where there is more than one wage earner living in a dwelling the amount of rates that are paid are adjusted to take that into account. Some of my hon. Friends have introduced a Private Member's Bill relating to England and Wales to this effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The idea is worth considering, because people are always worried by the fact there can be two identical houses—for example, semi-detached houses—one with a widow living in it, the other with a man, wife and son living in it. The rates they pay are exactly the same, yet the incomes coming into the houses are entirely different. Those are things that can be done now, while the inquiry is going on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also suggest that the inquiry should look at the question of industrial derating in Scotland. I have the impression, from information given me by friends who have factories in places such as Dundee, that over the years, because there has been 50 per cent. industrial derating, the assessors have upped the assessments of factories in order to obtain the same amount of money on 50 per cent. derating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is something the inquiry could look at, because it should be possible to assess, for instance, the valuations on, say, the motor car factories at Linwood and Bathgate compared with similar factories in the South, or on a carpet factory in Glasgow with one in the Midlands, and see whether the assessments that have been placed on the factories have been increased so as to overcome 50 per cent. industrial derating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, as we hope, we have extra prosperity in Scotland from North Sea oil, I can see that there will be pressure to abolish
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0290">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>127</span>
50 per cent. industrial derating. We want to make certain that if that happens it is done on a fair and equitable basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.27 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall accept your strictures, Sir Myer, and be as brief as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Henderson) and his maiden speech from the Opposition Front Bench. I do not agree with much of what he said, but I welcome him in his new role and, like my hon. Friend the Minister of State, I hope that we shall see the hon. Gentleman often on the Opposition Front Bench.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had the impression that the hon. Gentleman was having the greatest difficulty convincing himself, let alone the Committee. The problem of rates in Scotland, as elsewhere, is difficult and complex. It is not easily resolved, and it certainly will not be resolved within the context of party politics. That is absolutely certain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been occasions in history when one Government has been more sympathetic towards the ratepayers than another, but even in 1974, despite our having come through that experience, ratepayers in Scotland, as elsewhere, are certainly no nearer the solution to the problem of how to raise local government finance. To suggest, as the hon. Gentleman did, that most, if not all, of the problem can be attributed to the housing element in the rates is to conceal the depth of the problem. The fact is that housing in Scotland is not the overwhelmingly important element that hon. Gentleman opposite always think it is when we are discussing this thorny question of rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one examines the difference between the gross annual value and the rateable value of a house in Scotland, one sees right away that the difference is very small indeed, but if one looks eslewhere in the country and examines the difference between the gross annual value and the rateable value of a house one sees that the difference is very substancial. Therefore, it is a deception to suggest that housing in Scotland plays the important part in rates that hon. Gentleman opposite say it does.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Henderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was by no means making any special point about that. Clearly, there are other very expensive
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>128</span>
local government services. All that I did was to state the facts in a particular situation: it is an item which the country itself brought out as a factorworthy of note.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Housing has always been a factor worthy of note, but it is distorting the argument to suggest that it is the only element and that if we deal with it the problem of rating in Scotland will be solved. I assure the Committee that it will not do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My view is that the difficulty which we are in today has arisen because of the time-honoured formula by which allocations have been made. We have worked on the time-honoured quotient formula—the principle that finance is allocated per head of the population, rather than on the basis of need. This has had an effect on Scotland which, though not disastrous, we could well have done without. My view is that until we get down to a system of allocating finance on a basis of need, as distinct from allocating it per head of `population, we shall be in our present situation for a very long time to come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to deal briefly with the rate support grant, which is a good example of the sort of thing about which I am speaking. The rate support grant is supposed to take account of shifts in population, of industrial trends, and all these other patterns. If that is so—and it is—then the Borders—I am sorry the hon. Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles (Mr. Steel) is not here to hear me say this—and probably to a greater extent the Highlands and the North-East, are being subsidised by the central belt of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not saying that in a derogatory fashion. It is a fact of life that, because of the formula that we use in allocating the rate support grant, the major portion of the money goes to the more remote areas at the expense of the highly industrialised central belt of Scotland. This is a fact of life, and it should be placed on record when we are discussing solutions to the existing problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would refer briefly to the question of new methods of raising finance. I would argue strongly that the committee of inquiry while studying this problem will be faced with a direct choice between the abolition of the rating system as we know it and the retention of the present system after tinkering with it. I would argue strongly that there is a case for abolishing
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0291">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>129</span>
the rating system completely and financing all expenditure, both central and local, from direct taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members who talk in terms of local taxation should understand the dangers and difficulties involved in propounding this theory. I was interested in the proposal of the hon. Member for Fife, East (Sir J. Gilmour), that where there is a household with more than one wage earner the rate assessment for that house should be much higher than would otherwise be the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that that idea fails to recognise that single men and women, because of our taxation system, are paying more in direct taxation. If we talk of local taxes to supplement rate revenue, we are saying that we shall further penalise people who are already facing heavy burdens of direct taxation. I am not merely talking about single men and women. I am talking in many cases about widowers and widows who have the full responsibility of the domestic economy. It is unrealistic to place on them additional burdens which they could not possibly bear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to deal with the north-east of Scotland, because there are hon. Members here who no doubt will deal with that. What level of local taxation would be required in the constituency of the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mrs. Ewing) or Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. Henderson) or Banff (Mr. Watt), to finance the industrial development and build the infrastructure that is required there? Those areas would be placed at a distinct disadvantage if we were to talk in terms of local taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is making the problem far too simple to think that we can solve it merely by suggesting that if only we raise local taxation we shall have no more problems about rates and all the complaints that are natural when local authorities increase their rates from time to time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Member for Fife, East that there is a requirement to place on central Government the responsibility for such services as education and the total cost of police and firemen. Perhaps I should say that the police themselves—that is the members of the Chief Constables Committee—are opposed to having their revenue provided from the central Exchequer. They argue in my view with some justification, that this would bring them under the control of the Government of the day and would limit
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>130</span>
their freedom one way or another. This may just be an imagination on their part which is not justified, and I should not like to go into that, but when we talk about placing services on the central Exchequer we should understand also that some of the services involved—particularly the police force—themselves have objections.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir John Gilmour</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that their salaries are adjusted on a national level, and that they have to deal with the State in fixing their salaries?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree absolutely. I am agreeing with the hon. Gentleman that the revenue for those services should be the responsibility of the central Exchequer. All I am saying is that we have to recognise that some of those services have objections to what people such as the hon. Member for Fife, East and myself are saying. There is, in my view, a responsibility to look closely at whether we ought to transfer all the educational, police and fire service financial burdens on to the central Exchequer. I am sure that if we do we shall go a very long way towards solving our problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was rather distressed when I heard my hon. Friend the Minister of State say that he did not expect the reorganisation of local government to increase the rate burden. Even the early evidence is that the rate burden throughout Scotland will be substantially increased, not temporarily, but permanently as a result of the reorganisation of local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Strathclyde Region, in the fire service, for instance, it has already become clear that there will be many promotions. This will be due not to an increase in the number of personnel engaged in the fire service, but because of the wider areas covered, and this must be financed by extra revenue. This is the picture throughout the whole of Scotland, including the county of Fife. There will, therefore, be a permanent increase in rates as a result of the reorganisation of local government, and it is as well to face that fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Facing these facts, I look forward with interest to the findings of the committee of inquiry, which I am delighted that my Government have decided to set up to study this problem. It is not an easy problem, and we ought not to look for easy solutions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.40 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will pick up one or two points from the relevant and pertinent speech made by the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing). I want to start with the speech made from the Opposition Front Bench, and in so doing congratulate the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Henderson) on his maiden over, so to speak. I thought that he was a little unfair to the Government benches in his speech, which seemed to claim that somehow or other the Conservative Government were always far more sensitive to the problem of the ratepayer than the Labour Government. This is not the truth of the matter, despite the nodding of the head of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor). The truth of the matter is that both Governments in their day have sustained the rating system, advised and guided by the civil servants, and that both in their day have sought, in a variety of ways to ameliorate it, to lessen the injustices and make what everyone concedes is a bad system more bearable. I do not think that one can made party points on this issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The independent inquiry to which the Minister referred is to be welcomed, although one must put on record that a mistake was certainly made in not establishing a committee of this sort in 1966 and 1967, when we established a Royal Commission on local government in Scotland. That mistake was made even worse by the subsequent establishment of the inter-Departmental committee, which appears to have produced nothing at all, or at least nothing that will be sufficiently lasting or that prevents the Government from going ahead and setting up yet another committee to look at something which has been looked at many times before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was disappointed, however, to hear the Minister say that he felt that rates in some form or other would still continue after this inquiry has reported. In my view rates are a bad form of taxation, which produce all sorts of injustices and contradictions and they continue only because the administrators find it an easy tax to operate. We shall not get rid of rates until the politicians take the responsibility upon themselves and do not let their advisers tell them what to do all the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>132</span>
There should, in my view, be two objectives in reforming local taxation. The first should be to give local authorities greater independence. Why did we go through this whole exercise of local government reform unless it was to achieve that? The second objective is to give the authorities greater fund-raising opportunities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was astonished to hear the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Henderson) argue that the level of rate support grant did not affect the independence of the local authority from central Government. Indeed he boasted that a Conservative Government had increased the level of rate support grant and that this was an excellent thing. I have no doubt that it was excellent in terms of the provision of service, but in terms of the theory of the independence of local government, the more money central Government pays, the greater will be the degree of supervision they will demand for the way it is spent. That is the old story of the piper calling the tune. It is human nature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fully agree with remarks made both by the hon. Member for Fife, East (Sir J. Gilmour) and the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) that if we are to make local government meaningful we need a shift of taxation away from central to local taxation of whatever form. That means, logically, that less money should be paid in central taxation and more money paid in local taxation. The total amount paid in the end will probably not be all that different but it would create a different attitude in local government and it would he fairer than the present system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be repetitive of me to go over the various alternatives which exist to the rating system. Liberals have argued for donkeys ages, for site value rating, for example. I certainly think that in any reform there should be a land tax element of some kind, because many people slip through the net in that area. The range of local services is now so large, and is increasing, that, even if one did adopt this system, it would have to be supplemented by other means such as local taxation. There is no point in listing what all hon. Members know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, however, we shall not get rid of rates until the politicians are prepared to assert themselves. The Civil Service regards the system as easy and convenient

to operate. Administrative convenience should not be the criterion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to comment briefly on what the hon. Member for Fife, East (Sir J. Gilmour) said in his short and constructive speech. It is true, as the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) said, that the removal of teachers' salaries would immediately take a large burden from local government. That would be a step in the right direction, because it is part of the same process of central Government taking responsibility for the things over which they have control. It would not be a good thing to put the responsibility for paying the police in the hands of central Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the point already made by the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth who said that this may be more a theoretical matter than a practical one. But there is no doubt that, in this country, it is desirable for the police to be controlled by the local authority and not by the central Government. I do not think that any step which gave that impression—even if it were only an impression—would be necessarily a good one. I hope that the message that will go out of the Committee will be that, as soon as possible, across party lines, we want to see the end of the rating system and its substitution by a more effective, fairer, fund-raising method of local government taxation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Small</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is my morning for some thought on Greek mythology. I have listened to the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Johnston) on political will and the need for alert politicians to assert their rights over civil servants. As a political coalitionist, he intends to bury himself in some other establishment. It is this kind of Oedipus complex—hon. Members may remember the King of Thebes—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]—Hon. Gentlemen are familiar with him. He got into a physical struggle, as the Liberal Party is in a mental struggle, with his father and strangled him. At the end of the day, he had to marry his father's widow. The widow was Jocastra. That is known historically as incest. It is the political incest of the coalition between the Liberal Party and the Tory Party—
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>134</span>
the economic man and the abolition of rates—that confuses me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Bruce-Gardyne) on his wife's birthday. As far as I can see, most of the members of the Tory Party treat rates as if they were dealing with their mothers-in-law. They never have a good word to say about them. So I hope that his mother-in-law also congratulates him this morning, as I do now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is that there will be a continuing 4 per cent. built-in inflation rate as long as we modernise the style of life. The raising of the school-leaving age to 15 and then to 16, the cost of books, printing and other matters will see to that. The built-in percentage inflation rate will continue. We have to make up our minds on how local is local and how much is central. In the interim period the Association of County Councils and the convention of Royal Burghs, as advisers, continue on making up a financial allocation on a regional basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot see an easement for at least three or four years. The rate burden has to be borne. I say to those people who treat the case as being simple, that there will not be any radical change. There is no opportunity and no alternative scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn for a few minutes to the thought processes that are continuing throughout Scotland. If I read 	<i>The Scotsman</i> and Mr. William Wolfe correctly in terms of the new Assembly I cannot see the relationship between local government and central Government being assisted by an Assembly, with, as I understand it, 200 Members, according to the SNP philosophy of devolution, with its own Prime Minister and Cabinet. I doubt whether it would be of any assistance in helping the citizen in terms of local government. Such an Assembly cannot be run on nothing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is only one point I want to make on individual rating. As a sub-tenant with a family of two for 8½ years in the past I equally enjoyed the services and sent my children to a State school. Just ask the sub-tenant what he is paying for rent. He is generally paying much more than his share in the rate complex. He is paying his contribution indirectly. At that point I will retire from the current debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.54 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. J. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sir Myer, you have asked us to be brief and I shall endeavour to observe your instructions. I must tell the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Small) that I occasionally have a good word to say for my mother-in-law and I shall even have at least one good word to say about rates this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It often seems to me that hon. Members who argue about the inequities of the rating system indulge in the phantasy that if we abolished the rates the expenditure would disappear. There is a tendency to think that there are rates paid by individuals and there is expenditure borne by Government, as if Government had a purse of its own which was not supplied by the taxpayer. We should not imagine that we shall resolve the expenditures by switching the basis by which they are funded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my view—this is the one good word I have for the rating system—its one great attraction is that the rate demand comes in through the local office and is something of which the ratepayer is very conscious, a great deal more conscious than the PAYE recipient is of the burden of taxation. Hence I believe that the restraints of exaggerated rate-borne expenditure tend to be more effective than restraints on exaggerated expenditure financed through taxation. It is a substantial bonus on the side of the rating system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, I want to concentrate on one problem. It is related to the question of the impact of the reorganisation of local government. The Minister of State, in his opening remarks, complained that he and his hon. Friends
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>136</span>
had not been told by Gordon Campbell and my hon. Friends, when the reform of local government was coming in, that it would lead to an essential increase in the financial burdens on the ratepayers. Indeed they were not, as there is no ineluctable reason why there should be additional burdens arising from the reorganisation of local government. But I do think that there is every real prospect that those additional burdens will materialise, and this I find extremely worrying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have noticed what has been happening in my own area. One finds that where the new authorities inherit a given level of staffing for a particular service, that level is regarded as being the absolute minimum tolerable for the new system of local government. I believe it is essential that the new district and regional authorities throughout Scotland should be reminded most insistently the that purpose of local government reform is not to provide for the enlargement and aggrandisement of the members of the National Association of Local Government Officers. Its purpose is to improve the system for the benefit of the citizens, not for the benefit of the officials.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must have some control over what is happening by way of recruitment of staff under the system of local government, certainly if my own area is anything to go by. It is not acceptable that we should see the new local authorities at regional and district levels having either the same staffs as the authorities they inherited or, in many cases, substantially larger staffs. I have been somewhat alarmed by reports that I have read in the Press about the approach which the steering committees in my own area have adopted to this situation and, I regret to say, by the decisions to which they appear to be moved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have an obligation to remind these new local authorities that they are taking over at a time of unprecedented inflation, when there is an absolutely overriding obligation not to indulge in bureaucratic empire building and to ensure that the burdens imposed on the ratepayers are kept at the minimum levels consistent with the maintenance of essential services. I think that we must take good note of what has happened in England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State assured us this morning that he did not foresee, as a result of the reorganisation of local

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>137</span>
government in Scotland, anything like the same increases in the rating burden which occurred in England. I hope and pray that he is right. I wish that I could be more convinced than I am at this moment. I am sure of one thing: if the new local authorities are not deterred from engaging in bureaucratic empire building at this stage, we shall next year face the same problems as have been faced in England this year, and I believe our electors will feel that we did not do our duty and ensure that was avoided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.59 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Doig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Since our last debate on this rating system a number of people, I am glad to see, have come part of the way towards agreeing with what I advocated at that time, namely, that the rating system is bad. It is bad because it is unfair, and it is unfair because it penalises improvements in property. It also penalises large families and exempts single persons of working age and earning money from paying their fair share if they live with their parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also a wasteful system, because under it an assessor comes along, estimates an amenity value for an area, sends his officials to measure up the actual square footage of the house, and then proceeds to put a gross annual valuation on the property. This is a costly process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are alternatives to the present rating system, and these have been mentioned times without number. The most frequently mooted idea is a local income tax. Another is a sales tax such as operates in other parts of the world. To me, the only reasonable alternative is the complete abolition of the rating system but, unlike the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Johnston), I do not suggest that we should go over to a system of local taxation. If we did that we should merely set up a second means of raising revenue that would cost money. If there is one method of raising revenue, why go to the expense of having two different ways of raising the same revenue?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been said from time to time that we cannot abolish rates and raise all the money through central Government taxation because of the colossal sum of money involved. This large sum of money—it amounts to £2,800 million a year for the whole of Britain—does not have to be raised in addition to what is being raised
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>138</span>
now. It is being raised now, but by a less fair system. As the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Henderson) said, it produces howls of anguish from other than the rich, and it does so because it is an unfair system. It takes money from people in an unfair way. It takes large sums from people who cannot afford to pay, whilst allowing others to escape who can afford to pay. To that extent, I can understand that it raises howls of anguish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can overcome the problem by saying to the Government, "from now on we shall abolish the rating system". The Government will then raise this revenue, but it will not be an additional sum payable by the public. It will be the same amount of money, but it will be paid in a fairer way. I have never met anybody who argues that the present rating method is better than the present taxation method. If the taxation method is the fairer of the two, then the money ought to be raised by taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No doubt it will be said by many people, and it has been said before, that this will destroy the independence of the local authority system, and I want you to consider whether there is any validity in this argument. Let us consider the main items of expenditure by local authorities. The first of these is education. The largest item of expenditure under education is teachers' salaries. But they are not fixed by local authorities, so no freedom is lost there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a local authority wants to build a new school, it has to go to the Secretary of State for Scotland to get his permission. That applies not only when the money is being borrowed to do it, but when the local authority has the money itself. Again nothing is lost, because already Government permission is required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can go right down the list. The same comment applies to housing. If a local authority wants to undertake a large housing scheme, it has to get permission from the Government. It certainly has to get permission to borrow money to do it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now come to a contentious point—the control of police forces. My hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) and the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Johnston) seem to be very worried about control over the police passing into the hands of the Government. Who exercises this
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0296">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>139</span>
control at present? In the local authority on which I served 10 years, we frequently had complaints about the way chief constables used their power. It is astonishing to find that a local authority has no power whatever to tell a chief constable how to utilise his police force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities have the power to say, "We will not give you money to buy a motor car" or "We will not give you the money to buy various other items of equipment". But when it comes to the important point about how they deploy their force or which things to give priority to, the local authorities have no power whatever. So there is no real power to lose, other than the power to deny the police the modern equipment they need. That is all the power they have. Surely that should be taken away from the local authorities and vested in the central Government. At the moment the bulk of this power is vested in chief constables. Central Government have no power to control them, only a power to dismiss them. That is all the power they have. This is different from any other local authority official. A town clerk can be told what to do by his council, a Chamberlain can be told what to do by his council. So can a housing manager and every other official. But not the chief constable. He cannot be told what to do by his council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members may be happy that chief constables should have this autocratic power and be answerable to no one. I am not happy about it. I think that we ought to have control.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With all due respect, Sir Myer we are discussing the reform of the rating system. I am arguing for a method of reform. I am demonstrating the fallacies in the objections to the method of reform I am advocating. I cannot for the life of me see how that could be unimportant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we adopt this system substantial net savings can be made. First, we could abolish all city assessors and their departments. We could abolish all valuation appeal courts. That would produce a considerable saving. We could abolish the cost of administering the rate rebate
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>140</span>
system. That may be a small saving, but it would be a saving. We can go down this list and make a whole number of savings on things that would become totally unnecessary. These people could then be put to much better use, performing useful jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe for one minute that local authorities would lose any of their power if the Government paid the whole cost instead of what they pay at the moment—which is between 55 per cent. and 60 per cent. of the whole cost. They are already paying the major share. It is merely a question of allowing them to pay the extra. There are so many indirect savings to be made if this method is followed that it ought to be considered seriously by the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Winifred Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I first of all join with other hon. Members in congratulating the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Henderson). on his first speech from the Opposition Front Bench. The first time of doing anything is always difficult and he did it very well. I enjoyed the speech of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Small) very much. I cannot quite come up to his Greek mythology lecture this morning—perhaps another time. He made the point that when we discuss alternatives, as the hon. Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Doig) has done most thoughtfully, we must realise that we would have to discuss them for a long time, because it is a sweeping reform. All these other reforms are ahead of us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of us might have a lot of sympathy with some of the points made by the hon. Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Doig). My group would join me in saying that we should face the reorganisation ahead of us and keep these alternatives in mind. I agree with the proposition that people seem to accept tax with a better grace than they accept the thumping rate demand which comes through our letter-boxes. There might be something to be said for the thumping demand because it reminds us of our involvement with our local authority and our right, as members of the electorate, to have some control over it.

To take a simple example, the hon. Member for Dundee, West said that there would be a saving if the valuation appeal structure were swept away. This is a voluntary structure of citizens. The only salary paid is that of the secretary. I know that the secretaries are very often lawyers to whom the salary is a little "perk". The salaries are negotiated and they are not very generous. I just mention the point because there is one structure that involves participation and we want more participation, not less.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Lady not aware that paid officials are involved in the first instance?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These are judges whose salaries we are paying in any case. I would suggest that they are rather under-worked in some instances and that this extra duty would not do them any harm whatsoever. If the Government, or any other Government, were to set up a serious full-scale inquiry I hope we will play our part in trying to contribute to any debate. But I fall into the camp of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden who feels that for various reasons the time is not right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to cross swords with the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing), although I agreed with much of what he said. He said that we were all subsidised by the Central Belt of Scotland. I am afraid that I cannot agree with that, so far as Moray and Nairn is concerned. It may be true to say Moray and Nairn is subsidised by the distilleries—one could put it that way. Perhaps we are fortunate in that we live near the golden triangle of the River Spey. Actually the net rate in Moray is one of the lowest in Scotland, 53.34p. In Nairn, the other part of my constituency, it is 66.40p.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If anyone suggests that this is because in Moray and Nairn we have a poorer provision of services or more favourable grants, this is not borne out by the facts which I have here. We have most favourable services. We have a higher percentage of old people being cared for. I believe we have almost the highest expenditure in Scotland—I am informed of this by the County Clerk of Moray and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>142</span>
Nairn—on youth, the community and further education. We are very fortunate in our swimming pool and sports facilities. Many hon. Members may have visited the area and have come to the conclusion that we are rather fortunate in our services. Libraries are also of a very high standard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to whether we are favoured by grants to achieve this small rate, there are only five counties with a smaller rate support grant. I do not know all the financial reasons. I have not represented the constituency long enough to delve into the complicated details. But we are, perhaps, favoured by the distillery revenue and the revenue from two bases, although of course that creates other problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to say a little about transitional rating. The Minister will know that I am in correspondence with his Department on this matter and I have had quite an encouraging letter. This is a matter which is not peculiar to Moray and Nairn. It would affect any authority which, because of reorganisation, could face a 50 per cent. rate increase overnight. Whatever the background it is a bad situation that anyone should face such an increase immediately reorganisation comes into force. It is a bad thing, not only because of the hardship it will cause, but because of the resentment it will cause. Many of us were against the Wheatley Report but its recommendations are coming into force now. Everyone would like reorganisation to take place as smoothly as possible. It will certainly not be very smooth in Moray and Nairn if everyone has a 50 per cent. rate increase. Moray and Nairn will not be unique. There will be places in the industrial belt and all over Scotland where, for different reasons, people will be faced with large increases. The reorganisation may work out very well in the long term but in the short term many people will be faced with considerable injustices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This appeal is not coming from me as a Member of Parliament. It is coming from the united officials of my constituency who have done their homework and from the elected representatives of my constituency. I have been asked to make the point not just for my constituency but for every part of Scotland that may be in this situation. I am making a plea for transitional rating over five years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a letter, in reply to the letter I wrote on this subject, from Lord Hughes,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0298">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>143</span>
who states that he may consider a three-year period. That is something to be going on with, and encouraging indeed to my officials. But it is still not quite enough. If there are any parts of Scotland of which it could be said that they have not been providing enough services and would benefit as a result of the new region because they might get more they will not have them all within a year. They will not come up to standard—if they are below standard—within three years. I would therefore suggest five years, which is the figure I am asked to put by my representatives. I know that there is a difficulty about the date of the valuation, but I am sure that that difficulty could be ironed out if there is a will to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is my first plea. I have had a letter which says that Lord Hughes will meet local authorities. On being pressed he said he would do it by the autumn all over Scotland. He says he will
	<br><q><p>"consider with the local authorities".</p></q>
I would like an assurance that this phrase "consider with" means actually meeting local authorities if they so desire—obviously at the convenience of Lord Hughes. I would not like to think that "consider with" has any meaning other than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth said that some parts of Scotland suffered in education and housing more than others. I was once a Member of Parliament in an industrial belt seat and I can agree with him. My party's policy has always been in line with what he said today—if that is of interest to the Committee. We have always taken the view that education and housing should come out of the national exchequer. Our reasoning behind this is the very point that the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth made, that there is so much injustice. We cannot see rating ever getting down to dealing with the injustices. It may be that if we solved them, and had wonderful schools and houses suitable for the needs of everybody, then we could go back to considering some local arrangement. However, until what I regard as an emergency situation in many parts of Scotland is solved it is desirable that national policies settle education and housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>144</span>
The question of police is more tricky, because of the views expressed by many of the members of the constabulary, with whom I am not unacquainted as a result of the kind of work I have been doing for most of my life. I would be quite happy to go along with the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth who, if I quote him correctly, suggested that police too, should go on to the national Exchequer. I would like to think, however, that the management would remain at a fairly local level, because it seems to work in most parts of Scotland. Perhaps they could liaise to a greater extent. But they are all very jealous and do such a good job with such inadequate remuneration that I would not like to upset them very much at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden referred to the Wheatley Report. It was not our wish to create mammoth regions. We foresaw that if we were ever to be successful in pressing our point of an elected Scottish Parliament, which we have not succeeded in doing yet, there could have been complicated tiers. As we cannot be blamed for this—the tiers have been passed by the House and will come into effect—we cannot be expected to give up our desire to seek an elected Scottish Parliament. It is that which has brought us to the House. After all, it is not just a question of rates, it is to us a question of far more serious considerations, such as the dignity of making decisions on a wide variety of subjects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The subject of finance seems to be a source of hilarity. But it does not cause hilarity in the rest of the world. If even a share of the oil revenues is available there cannot be any serious difficulty in financing a Scottish Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Office—about which too many people make snide remarks—works efficiently with what I understand to be a much smaller percentage of civil servants than one finds in certain Departments in London. That is the opposite of Parkinson's Law. If one considers the excellent way in which it has carried out all the functions of semi-autonomy with a fairly small staff, one is encouraged to think that the expenditure of a Scottish Government with the Scottish Office as the embryo Civil Service would probably work in a rather stringent and economical way. At least, I like to think so.

	<p>12.22 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Lawson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we discuss the scandal of the rating system, we are talking of a manner of paying for services. If we look more carefully into the services we get for the rates that we pay, we may conclude that we pay much less for those services than we should if we had to pay for them separately. Let us imagine what it would cost if we entered into a separate contract, for example, to have our buckets emptied—we talk of buckets in the East, and dustbins in the West. My summary of the Socialist approach is that we seek to extend the area of collective responsibility, and we have to pay for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one aspect of the rating system which is seldom, if ever, mentioned. My hon. Friend the Member for Sterling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) may have spoken about it—I nipped out for a moment while he was speaking. If he did. I apologise to him. If we consider, for example, industrial rating in relation to the authorities in Scotland, we find that Glasgow is far ahead, as one would expect, in terms of the value placed on industrial property for which rates have to be paid, but one would also expect the cities to come afterwards—Edinburgh, Dundee, Aberdeen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is only recently that, in terms of industrial rating, Edinburgh went ahead of Motherwell, while Grangemouth is ahead of Motherwell. The rough order is that Glasgow is much the most heavily rated city in terms of industrial rating, Grangemouth comes next and Edinburgh has just crept up. I may be wrong, but I think that there is little difference between Edinburgh—a prosperous city with more than 500,000 people and plenty of industry —and Motherwell. They are more or less on a par in terms of the valuation placed on industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are several important issues here. First, there is the way in which industrial property is rated. In Motherwell it is based virtually upon one property—The Ravenscraig plant—because of the nature of the plant and the capital fixture. Because the capital is a fixture, we have a particular rating system. I suggest that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>146</span>
this is a severe limitation on capital expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The more one spends in terms of capital fixed equipment, the more one pays in rates. My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Doig) talked about housing and improving one's house and having to pay more rates. This can also apply to investment. If someone spends millions of pounds on capital fixed equipment—and certain industries must have certain types of equipment—he has to pay so much more rates. This also affects spending by local authorities. My authority gets no needs grant at all—not a penny—and has never had one over many years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ross and Cromarty (Mr. Gray) and the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mrs. Ewing) might think it useful—and perhaps my hon. Friend the Minister will deal with this—to look at the proportion of rate-borne expenditure that is met out of the national purse. The proportion that comes to my area is very small, whereas that which goes to areas such as Ross and Cromarty, and Orkney and Shetland is extremely high. I am not complaining, but I think that that should be noted when we talk about the unfairness of this rating system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The system should also be seen as one which has compelled areas such as those which we represent to pay substantial sums towards the areas which opposition Members represent. It is a grievance of mine that one of the first measures introduced by the Conservative Government in 1970 was to excuse the farming industry from paying any rates on its industrial buildings. Although those industrial buildings cause a lot of trouble and pollution in the countryside and require a lot of services to be rendered to them they were entirley excused from ratepaying because of the bias of the then Government. That was shown clearly by the reaction of the Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) when he said, "We reward our friends and supporters". it was an excellent example of the rewarding of friends and supporters, but there is an unfairness about it which should be borne in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not always against unfairnesses, because sometimes they perform a useful purpose. However, I am not very keen on having them known and having people understand what is being done.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0300">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>147</span>
Not many people understood what was being done on that occasion. Not many people appreciate the point that, because the industrial rating system is constructed as it is, we may be deterring investment in our own area. I hope that my hon. Friend will say a word or two about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.29 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In recent weeks we have seen south of the border, in England and Wales, the growth, for the first time on a national level, of an active ratepayers protest group. This is not confined to any particular social group, or to any particular sector of housing in the country. It is a group which believes that the level of rates in England and Wales is so high that serious action is demanded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This development is important to us in Scotland for two reasons. First, because it is inevitable that we shall see a similar movement in the weeks and months to come in Scotland. There will be a concerted move by people from all walks of life and all backgrounds to concentrate in the minds of those responsible their objection to the developments that have been taking place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, because it is significant that the protest groups that are now being formed in England and Wales are not directing their protests and their objections towards local authorities, but are demanding action from central Government. I suggest that this is because they realise that the vast increases in rates that many local authorities are having to face are due partly to the direct consequences of Government action and partly to the general economic situation, and only slightly to any deliberate attempt by local authorities to increase their expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When considering what type of reform of local government finance we wish to advocate, we must take that into account. I do not believe that much weight can be put on the suggestion that purely locally-raised finance is of tremendous democratic importance in determining people's participation and involvement in local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a great deal of sympathy for the suggestion made by the hon. Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Doig). It is clear to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>148</span>
all who have participated in local government that the so-called independence of local government, the so-called ability of local authorities to make important decisions affecting their own individual constituents, is severely limited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I disagree with the hon. Lady the Member for Moray and Nairn (Mrs. Ewing) about the significance of the effect of the rates demand coming through the letter-box. I believe that ratepayers know that the vast majority of the greatly increased rates is not the responsibility of local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To one extent I disagree with the hon. Member for Dundee, West. I am sympathetic towards the possibility of abolishing the rating system and replacing it by direct financing by central Government, but I would not use the so-called lack of independence of local authorities as a justification for that. I would argue that, concomitant with central Government taking over the financing of local government, we should use the new regional and district councils to give the local authorities much more independence in decision making.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the moment there is a great body of opinion which believes that, in terms of national finance, a separate Scottish Budget could be achieved; that the Government and the Exchequer could determine the total level of national finance and leave it to Scottish Ministers to decide how it should be spent. I suggest that the same could apply in terms of local authorities. Central Government could determine how much is to be given to the local authorities, and it could then be left to them to decide how best it should be spent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem of rates is becoming dramatic, and it is incumbent upon whichever Government are in power at any given time to take determined action to deal with the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

hon. Gentleman speaking about the possibility of helping one's friends with this constructive little act, I was thinking back to a few weeks ago when we had the shameful and shameless attempt by the Government to offer a straight bribe of £10 million to some of their trade union friends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lawson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not rather remarkable that an hon. Member who represents a town is so ready to belly crawl to the people who have some money behind them? A guttersnipe of the worst kind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Never having had any money, I do not think I should appreciate someone who had it if I saw him. However, I can see plenty on the Government benches when I look there. The hon. Gentleman having made such an irresponsible contribution to the debate, I hope that he will listen to me for a few minutes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important point which my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbartonshire, East (Mr. Henderson) made in his excellent speech was the simple fact that we are facing an emergency the like of which we have not seen in Scotland for many years, and we are asking the Government to take action to deal with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rate burden that is facing us this year in Scotland is of unprecedented proportions, and when the rates demands to which my hon. Friend referred come thumping through the letter boxes they will come at the same time as the average family will be facing a staggering rise in electricity prices and a substantial increase in both their telephone bills and coal bills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A great deal of time today has been spent in talking about responsibility for the situation, and I should not suggest that the Government carry the entire responsibility for the inflationary situation or the other problems of local government. However, we have an alarming problem, in that may people in Scotland will not be able to pay the kind of increases which they will be facing this year. Something must be done about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A few weeks after the Government came to power they proposed—we did not object to the proposals by voting against it; in fact we did not even have a debate on it—that, because people living in rented properties, particularly council properties, were facing an increase of 50p a week under the Housing Finance Act, as a contribution
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>150</span>
to inflation and to try to alleviate hardship, they would introduce a rent freeze. There are arguments for and against this, but I suggest that, if the Government are to be consistent and say that people who live in council homes cannot afford an extra 50p a week this year, when we have some ratepayers—and everyone is a ratepayer, including the council tenant—facing increases which could be £1 a week or well above for some families, we should take some action to try to alleviate the burden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been suggested that we did not do a great deal about the problem. As the hon. Gentleman has admitted, we did, as a Government, increase the proportion of expenditure covered by Government grants from 55 per cent. to 58 per cent. during our term of office. We greatly improved the rebate scheme, introduced admittedly by the previous Government, so that, instead of about 100,000 people benefiting from rent rebates, we had 300,000. We extended the system of domestic relief. More important, we introduced a system of monitoring to try to restrain spending by certain local authorities, and I believe that, apart from the immediate impact of this monitoring on authorities like Dunbartonshire and Renfrewshire, the deterrent effect of the existence of monitoring had a substantial effect on all the others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How bad is the situation? The other day I had replies from both the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Secretary of State for the Environment about the average burden of domestic rates per household in the two countries. This showed that in 1973 the average amount of rates paid per household in England and Wales was £65.52 and in Scotland £65.42. This would appear to indicate that the average burden per house in Scotland and England was the same. The actual burden per head of population, on the other hand, is of course considerably more in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is important is what will happen this year. We have had some very ominous indications of what is happening in Scotland. My hon. Friend has rightly drawn attention to the fact that in Dunbartonshire we have had a massive rise of 2'7p in the pound in the flat county rate. This, according to my estimation, comes to about 38 per cent., although we shall have substantial variations in the different burghs covered by this authority.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0302">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>151</span>
For example, in the Vale of Leven the domestic rate has gone up 31p to a total of £1·29 and the commercial and industrial rate has gone up 33p to £1·46. Although domestic ratepayers are facing a substantial burden, the empty shops in our high streets and some of our new shopping centres should make us well appreciate that this burden is also a very severe one for industry and for commerce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will it mean in cash terms? It means that in Dunbartonshire, the one big authority which has declared a rate, those who paid £100 in rates last year will pay £138 this year; those who paid £150 last year will pay £207 this year. Glasgow and Lanarkshire still have to make their declarations. Where is the money coming from? I suggest to the Government that money certainly will have to appear if they are to do something specific for the local authorities, that when we have a Government who were prepared only a short time ago, although we stopped them, to give £10 million to the unions as a bribe—as I have mentioned—and who are apparently willing to spend hundreds of thousands of millions of pounds on nationalisation schemes which will make no real contribution to the welfare of the nation, then they certainly can afford to make a contribution here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What should be done? I believe that one very fair step which could be taken would be to reimpose a system of monitoring of expenditure of local authorities. If the Government were satisfied with what was being done by these authorities in their spending and felt there was no unreasonable spending, rate demands this year could be limited to an increase of 10 per cent. This would be fair and reasonable and should be undertaken and seriously considered by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second possibility would be to consider the transfer of services. The hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) mentioned the police and the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mrs. Ewing) mentioned housing and others, but I think that a change of this sort is not the kind that could be done suddenly or urgently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the only step which could reasonably be taken would be a system of interim relief, which would limit rate rises this year to 10 per cent. so long as the Government are satisfied that there
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>152</span>
has not been excessive spending by the local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But, while we have a problem this year, the hon. Member for Fife, East (Sir J. Gilmour) rightly said that we could face an even more dramatic problem next year when we have the reorganisation of local government. The hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mrs. Ewing) rightly said that many of the authorities particularly in the county areas, are extremely worried about what will happen to their rate burden as a result of the reorganisation of local government. We have seen what has happened in England and Wales. The previous Government introduced a system of variable domestic relief which would result, by and large, in an equal rise in the rate burden throughout England and Wales. Thus, if one authority was to suffer a savage increase in rates the system of variable domestic relief would have limited it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, the Government changed all this and brought in a flat rate for domestic relief. The result has been that in some areas of England there have been rate rises of 100 per cent. and more, whereas in other areas there has been very little change. Bearing this in mind, we would like a clear assurance from the Government that, in preparing for next year, they will introduce a system of variable domestic relief, so that the increases in rates will be broadly of the same level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had all the indications of what the problem might be. The hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Lambie), speaking to the delegates of the District Councils Association, said he feared rates would rise by 50 per cent. following reorganisation. The Provost of Cumbernauld, Provost Murray, said that he was most concerned about the effects of reorganisation on his burgh, which he felt could mean an extra 50p in the £.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the least we are entitled to is an assurance that the broad aim of the Government will be to ensure that, all things being equal, there will be a stability in the rating burden throughout the country. My hon. Friend the Member for Southend, West (Mr. Channon) has rightly pointed out the dangers of the new authorities overspending, and taking on excessive numbers of staff. I think we have all seen the Press reports in a paper called the 	<i>Courier and Advertiser,</i> which I believe is published
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0303">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>153</span>
in Dundee, dealing with some of the specific problems facing the new Tayside Regional Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It appears that it has increased its staff above what exists in the constituent authorities. The Working Party is prepared to recommend an additional 500. We could have empire-building at a time of inflation. I hope the Government will—as did the previous Government—have a system of strict monitoring to ensure that this does not occur.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Everyone appears to have agreed that we need a change of system. It is interesting that the hon. Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Doig), who was a lone voice in this Committee the last time we discussed rates, now has many allies, partly because in a debate last week in the House the combined Oppositions forced the Government to give an assurance that they would review the rating system in view of the special situation created this year by increases in spending. But, however it was done, the important thing is that we now have agreement that there is to be an urgent review of the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was disappointed to hear the Minister say that in his view there could not be a fundamental complete change of the system and that probably some element of rating would continue. I am not sure of his precise words, but he certainly did not appear to consider there could be a fundamental change in the system. That looks like an unfortunate degree of backsliding since our debate last week. The hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Johnston) spotted this point and I think it is a fair one to put.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My own feeling is that the various alternatives—local income tax, for example—would be utterly unacceptable because under a local income tax we would have the crazy situation that where profits, wages and employment tended to be higher, there would be a lower rate of income tax. In depressed areas where there were low profits and low wages and a little unemployment, there would be a high rate of income tax. This would be a disincentive to regional development. Apart from that there is the special problem of how to tax industry and commerce. How precisely could firms like I.C.I. and B.P. with offices in some areas and factories in others, be assessed for a local income tax by the constituent authorities?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>154</span>
At the end of the day, I believe that the only scope for a major reform is to consider the transfer, in part or whole, of the burden of local government revenue collection to the national Exchequer. I believe that there are many advantages in such a change. First, we would have an equal burden throughout the country. Secondly, everyone would make a contribution. Thirdly, the money would be easier to collect. Fourthly—and this is most important—it would enable the Government to keep a tighter rein on local government spending. It would, in some way, remove a certain element of freedom from local authorities to raise their own revenue, but they would have within the system complete freedom to spend more on the needs of the locality, and this would be a step forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All this is in the future. We are asking the Government today to do something about the urgent problem which exists in Scotland now and which will become more urgent as different authorities announce their rate increases this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that in the debate last week we did not have a statement of policy from the Secretary of State. I fully understand why he cannot be here today, but the amount of delegation we seem to be having is astonishing. We very rarely seem to see him here at a Scottish Committee. He is delegating so much that some of us are beginning to wonder whether he exists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important thing, bearing in mind that we have an alarming situation which will cause a great deal of distress and concern in Scotland, is that some interim relief should be offered now. The facts are becoming available, they will become available more readily as time goes on, and the ratepayers of Scotland will be quite unable to bear the burden which may well fall on them within the next few months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We ask for urgent action now, The Government, as my hon. Friends said, have a clear choice to do something or do nothing. If they do nothing, they will certainly stand condemned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

point right away about the absence of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland. Normally I should have told the hon.

He knows perfectly well that the Secretary of State is at a certain meeting which takes place invariably every Thursday morning. It is unworthy of any hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two pleasant things I wanted to begin with were first to thank you personally, Sir Myer, for your words of thanks to me at Tuesday's sitting, which I appreciated very much, and secondly to compliment the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Henderson) on speaking from the Front Bench. We have a couple of things in common. He and I for purposes of mutual convenience get together to enable this place to run more efficiently from time to time, although I shall not allow that to influence my judgement or comment. Secondly, it is just so happens that the one and only time I spoke from the Opposition Front Bench was on local government finance. I am not sure that there is any significance in that, other than that I had to wait eight years for the opportunity and the hon. Gentleman has done it in four months. I caution him, that he should not make to many political points when he is there, in case he has any hope of ever appearing on this side, which is always a matter of great satisfaction to hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having re-read my speech on local government finance, I am delighted to be able to say that I have not caused any embarrassment to myself in this new-found position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps this is being traditional, but I should like to take a few minutes to reply to some of the points made. The hon. Member for Fife, East (Sir J. Gilmour) spoke on a favourite theme of his about the salaries of teachers and some of the major items of expenditure in local government being transferred entirely to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>156</span>
central Government. This has been echoed by other hon. Members. I must confess that, on the face of it, it is attractive because it might relieve rate burden, but there are obviously snags. The total amount of salary required for teachers in Scotland in 1974–75 is £148 million while in the United Kingdom it is about £1,500 million. It is not an insignificant amount. All of us need to think it through. If the impression is to be left that we are merely doing something that will make it a more efficient service or a better one, but it will be cheaper, I think it is misleading. I am sure that the hon. Member does not intend it, but it is one of the undesirable side effects of the argument about transfering the major items of expenditure or services that create the heavy expenditure in local government to the central Exchequer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would concede one small point about industrial derating. The hon. Gentleman had the suspicion that in some areas, perhaps, industrial valuations are slightly higher than one would normally expect merely to recoup the 50 per cent. derating. I suppose there is something in it, but it is a matter of valuation rather than of rating. Do not ask me how we arrive at that position. It still reflects in Scotland the share of rate burden borne by different categories, compared with England and Wales. The industrial subjects in Scotland is only 10·9 per cent. whereas in England it is 12·7 per cent. Clearly that does not seem to reflect the 50 per cent. It may also be something that could be examined by the committee. I am not sure whether the hon. Member was complaining about it or suggesting it was a good thing that industrial derating should be abolished in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) raised what I thought was an interesting point. It was re-echoed by other Members; the question of the so-called subsidisation between urban, county or country areas. All hon. Members will recognise that it is not a question of ratepayers in an urban area subsidising ratepayers in a country area, but, in the general distribution of grant; the basic principle is that of supplying the greatest help to the areas with the greatest need. What is need? It may be argued that the urban areas have greater needs now, because of some of the social problems involved. Everyone knows there are greater problems there. Deciding what are the areas of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0305">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>157</span>
greatest need in attracting financial resources would quite properly be a matter for the committee of inquiry that has been appointed. I shall be referring to it in a minute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Johnston) made his usual speech. It was a good one, but it inevitably started with having a bash at both parties, which is a basic Liberal principle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

They are setting to work in suggesting that there would be some merit in having an association with the Conservative party. I should have thought that is a dangerous line for any party to pursue. Having said that, I think the hon. Gentleman made a thoughtful contribution, naturally, having been a member of the Wheatley Commission. He did not suggest what the solutions were. He will not mind if I say this. What he said—and it is marvellous to be able to state the objectives without coming up with the answers—was that there should be greater independence for local authorities and, therefore, they needed additional sources of revenue, of local revenue, I understood him to say. This is the 64,000-dollar question. Is the hon. Gentleman arguing, then, that there should be further increases in local taxation of one kind or another? I am not complaining about that. I am merely saying he highlights a dilemma, which we have to face, of how to give greater freedom to local authorities without giving more freedom in financial terms. He and I would agree that these are desirable objectives, but how to attain them is a much more complex matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to say to the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn that I can give her the assurance, which she has already had, that the noble Lord, Lord Hughes will meet local authority associations on the transitional arrangements. He has already given that assurance, and I repeat it. He will shortly commence discussions with local authority associations on the specific matter of grant arrangements for 1975–76. I will deal with the longer term in a moment.

May I finish by dealing with the point of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart? I knew that somewhere in his speech the Secretary of State for Industry would be mentioned. I do not see what he has to do with local rates, but nevertheless he was brought in as usual. I think that he devalues politics because he has been—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

He knows that the rate support grant and the increase order are things which are largely the result of the policies of the previous Government. I am not complaining about that, but for the hon.

constructive points made will be put to that committee. One word of warning: I hope that hon. Members opposite will not, in their desperation to criticise the Government or their vigour in challenging the rating system, do anything to destroy the opportunities and possibilities of a reformed local government in Scotland providing better services for the people of Scotland. It would be dangerous and a blow to democracy if they did this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
