DRAFT EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES (DEFINITION OF TREATIES) ORDER 1974</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>10.31 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Mr. Roy Hattersley)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee have considered the draft European Communities (Definition of Treaties) Order 1974.</p></blockquote>
With permission, I shall make a brief statement of introduction and explanation, attempting to clarify why today's procedure is necessary and why we conduct ourselves over these matters in the way that we do. I hope I may, therefore, simply introduce the five items referred to in the order in the briefest of terms, leaving the majority of the time this morning to hon. Members, in the knowledge that if your eye is caught, Mr. Wells, and if it is the Committee's wish, my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Trade will do his best to deal with the substance of the five items, their content and their importance. He will deal not simply with those three items which are directly his departmental responsibility but will do his best to answer questions on two other treaties which are more properly the responsibility of the Department of Overseas Development.<br><br>
I hope that the Committee will understand that I mean no disrespect if briefly this morning I absent myself from the proceedings. These are difficult times in the Foreign Office and a number of urgent matters are at this moment under consideration. It may, therefore, be my painful duty to leave briefly in the middle of our proceedings, and I hope that the Committee will forgive me if that proves to be necessary.<br><br>
The European Communities Act 1972 gives effect in the United Kingdom to all rights, powers, liabilities, obligations and restrictions embodied in treaties of the Community. Those Community rights and obligations do not apply in this country
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
unless they arise under the Community treaties as defined in Section 1 of that Act—a guide for the assistance of members of the public being appended to that Act in the form of a list of treaties which were then appropriate to, and are now governed by, that Act.<br><br>
That is how acts of the Communities obtain the force of law in Great Britain. Agreements entered into, or acts made, after 22nd January 1972—the date of the Treaty of Accession—are not regarded as Community treaties and therefore do not carry the relevant Community advantages, rights, privileges and penalties unless they are designated officially and formally under a procedure covered by Section 1(3) of the European Communities Act. That is what we are aiming to do today, giving under those powers full right and status for Community treaties so that the force of law as discharged in the courts of this country, and discharged in other ways, applies to them.<br><br>
In practice, most of the treaties which need to be designated in this way are treaties not of the European Economic Community but of the European Coal and Steel Community. That comes about because treaties carried out by the ECSC, and arrangements entered into by it, are traditionally—for reasons of history which need not detain the Committee—normally made as agreements between individual States and then need to be given this Community status by procedures under Section 1(3) of the European Communities Act. That, basically, is the procedure we offer and ask for in terms of the first three items in today's order.<br><br>
The draft order was laid on 8th June as a definition of and treaties order. Five treaties are listed in the schedule, and each of those treaties with texts in their entirety has been available in the House to hon. Members either as a Command Paper or as part of the official journal of the European Community. Of the five treaties specified, three are instruments of the European Coal and Steel Community, laid for the reason that characterised that Community, which I have tried to describe. With the Committee's permission, I shall now deal with the three treaties relevant to the European Coal and Steel Community.<br><br>
The first of the three treaties provides for tariff preferences for products covered
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0470">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
by the European Coal and Steel Community which originate in Finland. In fact, under our obligations to and in the EFTA, the United Kingdom is already providing tariff-free access for Finnish goods. Therefore, all that the treaty does is to oblige us not to re-impose tariffs on Finnish material. We are giving the free trade provisions which have long been the practice of this country the status of Community law and committing ourselves not to move away from that practice in the future.<br><br>
The second and third European Coal and Steel Community treaties provide for tariff preferences and quotas for certain steel goods which originate in developing countries. They form part of the general scheme of preference of the Communities, which the British Government hope to see extended as part of our negotiating aims. Therefore, the second and third items in the schedule are greatly welcomed by the Government.<br><br>
The fourth and fifth items deal with overseas aid. They are protocols extending earlier agreements entered into by the United Kingdom, extending the Wheat Trade Convention and the Food Aid Convention, both of 1971 and both now incorporated into the International Wheat Agreement of 1971. They appear in the schedule for a reason that is almost but not quite technical. As the original acts were said to be Community acts, in the extension of them by these protocols it was thought right to include them in today's order so that the protocol extension itself could be given the status of a Community agreement.<br><br>
Today's draft order follows procedures and precedents laid down by the House in 1972 and 1973. I assure the Committee that all the treaties for which we ask designation in this form are treaties which the Government believe are in no way inimical to the Government's objects of renegotiating the terms of British entry into the EEC. I believe, too, that the benefits, although they may be technical in terms of the fourth and fifth items, are necessary for a prudent Government to provide to ensure that laws which affect this country and those with whom we trade have a clearly defined and precise status. I hope that the Committee will feel it proper to accept the provisions.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
<p>10.39 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Blaker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I fully understand why the Minister of State may have to leave during our proceedings.<br><br>
This debate is a further demonstration that Parliament can debate EEC acts. The order offers a better opportunity of debating EEC acts than we should have if each of the matters under discussion had been an agreement made directly between the United Kingdom acting alone and the other international organisations referred to. I am advised that the Wheat Trade Convention of 1971 was never debated in the House. We have an opportunity to debate the protocol today. As regards the first three matters—Finnish products and the generalised scheme of preferences—had they been matters which were the subject of agreement directly between this country and other countries, they would have been subject to the negative resolution procedure and not, as is the case here, to the affirmative resolution procedure. Thus, they might not have been debated. The United Kingdom scheme of generalised preferences for developing countries was debated only because it was put down by my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, South (Mr. Boardman) in 1971.<br><br>
The second feature of the five matters we are debating is that they are all enlarging benefits which are enjoyed by other countries. In my opinion, we, too, shall benefit from them. They all encourage trade or aid. Therefore, I welcome them. But I should point out that they give no encouragement to those hon. Members who take the view that the Communities would be inward-looking bodies.<br><br>
With regard to trade with Finland, the Minister of State outlined clearly and concisely what the decision does. We welcome the decision to preserve our free trade with Finland. It also reduces the tariffs imposed by other members of the ECSC on Finnish goods to 60 per cent. of what they were formerly. This is a process of gradual reduction to nil over a period of years.<br><br>
I wish to put one question to the Minister of State. The decision is an interim one pending the coming into force of the agreement between the member States of the ECSC and Finland, which was signed last October. I take
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0471">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
it that the reason for the interim decision is simply that the processes of ratification by the various member countries have not yet been completed, and there is no particular reason for the delay. Perhaps the Minister of State or his hon. Friend will answer that question when winding up the debate.<br><br>
The next two decisions concern the scheme of generalised preferences of the Community. We have now come to an agreement, a compromise, with the other members of the Community on the sort of scheme to be brought into force, and 1974 is the first year in which there has been a joint scheme, a harmonised scheme, of generalised preferences. It has involved certain changes in the techniques which we formerly used and, no doubt, certain changes in the techniques which the other countries formerly used, but the net result has been an enlargement of the area of free trade in the world.<br><br>
I understand—perhaps the Minister will confirm this—that the generalised scheme of preferences of the Community has shown a steady liberalisation over the years. The Community was, I think, the first body to bring in a scheme of generalised preferences. I am told that the coverage of the current scheme. which I think is the 1973–74 scheme, is 40 per cent. more generous than the scheme in the previous year. That is, of course, allowing for the fact that the Community has been enlarged by the adherence of three member countries. I am told also that the number of sensitive items which enjoy special protection under this scheme has been steadily reduced, which again is a process of continuous liberalisation. I understand that in 1973 there were 60 sensitive items, that in 1974 there are 52, and that the proposals of the Commission for the next year of the scheme involve a substantial reduction in the number of sensitive items to seven.<br><br>
I understand also that the Community is proposing an expansion in the information service for developing countries so as to make sure that the developing countries are aware of the benefits which are available to them under the generalised preference scheme. So what is happening with the generalised preference scheme is that we are spreading the benefits of freer trade with the Community across
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
the whole developing world. That is one of the objectives which the former Conservative Government believed and the present Government believe to be desirable, that the benefits of trade with the Community should not be limited only to the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries of the developing world but that they should be more widely spread across the other continents as well.<br><br>
In relation to the last two items—the Food Aid Convention and the Wheat Trade Convention—will the Minister clarify certain points? Command Paper No. 5624 gives the text of the protocols, but it does not say how they have been worked out or who the parties are. Is the Committee to assume that the parties to the protocols are the same parties as originally concluded the earlier agreements?<br><br>
Second, in the food aid protocol no figure is set down for the amount of food aid which it is intended that the Community shall provide. In the previous agreement, which this is prolonging, there was a figure of just over 1 million tons of grains which was intended to be provided by the Community of Six. As I recall, the Report of the Select Committee on Overseas Development, issued last summer, said that the intention was that the amount of food aid in the form of grains which would be provided by the enlarged Community after the adherence of the new members would be increased to 1,287,000 tonnes, of which 225,000 tonnes would be provided by this country.<br><br>
Why does no figure appear in the protocol for the Community? It may be —I surmise that this is the reason—that the intention is to preserve flexibility so that we in the Community can take a decision about the exact details of our food aid programme both for this year and for coming years. I surmise that from a recent report from the Commission which, I understand, was debated by the European Parliament only last Friday, so that I have not seen the report of the debate. The report dates from April 1974, Document 37/74, and sets out a comprehensive proposal for food aid for the coming three years. It makes the point that the developing countries are facing a serious food crisis, more serious than any other since the war, and that this is especially true, as hon. Members
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0472">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
will be well aware, of the poorest countries, those which have not benefited from the increase in the price of oil nor from the increase in the price of other primary commodities such as minerals.<br><br>
The immediate reasons for this serious crisis for the developing countries are fully set out in the document—the recent droughts, the big purchases of grain by the Soviet Union, the increase in demand from many parts of the developed world. In the longer term, the reasons are the failure of the green revolution to come up to expectations, the rapid increase in population, the social structures of some of the developing countries, and scarcity of capital.<br><br>
The forecasts of the dimensions of the food problem for the poorer countries of the developing world are very alarming, and they tie in with forecasts which are coming from the Food and Agriculture Organisation and from the United Nations. They are relevant for a num- ber of reasons, but they are relevant also to the optimism which has been expressed about the prospects for prices of food on the world market. If these forecasts are correct, it would be unrealistic of us to expect that world food prices will come down. That means that the Community's food aid programme will be even more important than it otherwise would have been.<br><br>
The Commission proposed that the Nine members should adopt a three-year indicative programme with minimum and maximum quantities each year a firm figure should be set, depending on the needs of the various recipient countries. The minimum quantity of food grains specified is 1,700,000 tonnes, which is a substantial rise on the figures I quoted which were reported by the Select Committee a year ago. The maximum figure for food grains is 2,500,000 million tonnes. There are also proposals for food aid in the form of other commodities such as skimmed milk, butter, oil and so on. The report takes note also of the fact that the food aid programme of the United States, which until now has been one of the principal food programmes in the world, is declining in size.<br><br>
The conclusions of the Select Commit- tee which reported last year were that, first, food aid had a valuable role to play; second, that in the long run we should not encourage the developing countries
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
to rely on food aid but we should encourage them to develop their own agriculture so that they could be more self-reliant; and third, that the programme of food aid should not be used as a means of getting rid of surpluses resulting from the agricultural policy of the Community. If this were to happen the developing countries would be discouraged from developing their own agriculture.<br><br>
I am glad to see on reading the document from the European Commission that it takes full account of these points. It makes another point, too, which will be welcome to members of the Committee, namely, that while some of the aid proposed should be direct Community aid, supplied by the Community to recipient countries, a substantial and possibly increasing part of it should be channelled through multilateral bodies, notably the World Food Programme which is a specialised agency of the United Nations.<br><br>
I should, therefore, like the Minister to tell us whether I am right in believing that the purpose of the form that the protocol takes, which we are being asked to approve as part of the order, is to provide flexibility so that we can fit into it the food programme of the Community on the lines outlined in this Community document—if that is approved by the Council of Ministers. It has not yet, of course, been to the Council of Ministers.<br><br>
I want the Minister to answer three questions. First, quantities. The proposals in the document are expressed in quantities, and I mentioned some of the quantities just now. If they are to be expressed in quantities, do we not have difficulty in estimating in advance what the cost will be, bearing in mind the wildly fluctuating prices for world food that we have seen in the past two years? I am not suggesting that this is an insuperable problem, but it seems to me to be a problem.<br><br>
Second, what are the budgetary implications for this country in connection with our contribution to the Community budget? This is one of the matters which the Government have taken up with the Community, and it will be useful for the Committee to know how the cost of the food aid programme, so far as it affects the United Kingdom, will affect our contribution to the Community budget.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0473">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
Third, I should like an assurance that this food aid programme, if it is adopted by the Council, will not be at the expense of other aid programmes in this country.<br><br>
I end by making one suggestion. When the food aid programme is adopted by the Council, as I hope it will be, arrangements should be made for much better publicity, both in the member countries and world-wide, for the fact that the Community already has an ambitious and generous food aid programme which we intend to improve.<br><br>
With those words, I welcome the document before us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Skinner.</span></p>
<p>10.57 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dennis Skinner</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, Mr. what's your name—Wells, is it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skinner</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was just inquiring your name, Mr. Chairman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is customary to know the Chairman's name. If hon. Members do not know the Chairman's name, ill-manners are no advantage. Mr. Skinner.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skinner</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are not likely to know the Chairman's name in a committee of this kind because the way in which this whole operation has begun is so slipshod as to be almost out of this world.<br><br>
For instance, we got a note some time during the course of the end of last week, which said that some of us at least—I do not believe for a moment that the hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton (Mr. Marks) got a note to be a member of this Committee, but he has somehow deposited himself within the confines of the Committee and for that reason I shall, of course—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member may be ignorant of the proceedings of the Committee. He may be ignorant about the rules of the Committee. However, it is quite easy for hon. Members who wish to find out to apply themselves and find out. The hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton (Mr. Marks), and, indeed, any hon. Member of this House, is entitled to attend the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
proceedings) of these Committees and speak, but not to vote.<br><br>
I shall be grateful if the hon. Member will address himself to the Question before the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skinner</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was hoping we would get round to that. It seemed rather strange to me that the hon. Member for Gorton should be sitting in this room behind the Minister, although he is the Minister's Parliamentary Private Secretary. Contrary to many of the Standing Committees upon which I have sat before, dealing with purely domestic affairs, here we have one of my hon. Friends sort of wandering in, having previously told me that he was not involved in any way, and he found it rather strange—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must ask the hon. Member to address himself to the Question before the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skinner</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not unusual in this sort of situation where you have got a Chairman who is very much in favour of the Common Market—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is intolerable that the hon. Member should question the impartiality of the Chair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skinner</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of the fact that the procedure in this particular Committee, as I said at the outset, is not very much like the ordinary Committee procedure, I think it is fair to assume that there will be many misgivings not merely about the chairmanship of such a Committee but also about those who participate in its proceedings.<br><br>
I do not find it difficult, for instance, to question the impartiality of the Chair on a matter of this kind, for the very good reason that the whole question of the Common Market was voted upon on 28th October 1971 in which you, Mr. Chairman, took a very significant part, inasmuch as you made it abundantly clear, both on that occasion and on subsequent occasions, that not only were you in favour of the Common Market but that you were also in favour of the negotiations that were completed at and about that time. I should have thought that one could hardly suggest that you could be impartial on this matter, taking into account my views and those of my hon. Friends the Members for Watford
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0474">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
(Mr. Tuck) and Middleton and Prestwich (Mr. Callaghan). It would seem to me that you are bound to take a very different line. It would be inconceivable for a Chairman who is strongly in favour of the Common Market to come anywhere near to impartiality, when taking into account the view which I hold, which is to get Britain out as quickly as possible.<br><br>
Therefore, I do not think that you should get all het up and excited because I question your views on this matter. They are well known, as indeed are mine. Therefore, I shall not withdraw any reference to the question of your impartiality on the subject of the Common Market.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am aware that the hon. Member is trying to be impertinent—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skinner</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is your interpretation, not mine.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hugh Dykes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skinner</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Are you the Chairman now?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order—but I must bear with the hon. Gentleman because of the position of the Chair. He was sufficiently courteous to me at the beginning of the proceedings to indicate that he did not know my name and, yet, a few moments later he was sufficiently courteous to indicate that he knew precisely where I might have stood at one time on the question of the Common Market. But he was sufficiently ignorant of my history to have known where I stood at another time.<br><br>
The hon. Member's traditional impertience to the Chair in this House may or may not go on. The proceedings of this Committee are quite simple. They last for one and a half hours exactly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skinner</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I realise that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Member wishes to waste the time of his colleagues on both sides of the Committee—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skinner</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You are wasting time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:—for an hour and a half, he is absolutely at liberty to do so. However, I and other occupants of the Chair in this House deplore his conduct.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skinner</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In relation to whether I knew your name, while seeming to know precisely how you voted on the Common
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
Market, I think it would be fair to say that some of us take fully into account people's actions, but that is not to say that because we may not know their names at a precise moment, we cannot know of their activities.<br><br>
For instance, I do not know the name of the hon. Gentleman third from the end, but I should be prepared to suggest that I knew precisely where he stood on issues. That would not be a big job.<br><br>
As for impertinence to the Chair—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hugh Dykes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Get on with it, you idiot!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skinner</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Ah! I think you ought to ask the hon. Member to withdraw that remark, Mr. Chairman. It is an unparliamentary term. Well, come on; are you going to show your impartiality? Did you hear the remark that he made? Ah, well, that silence is typical of the Common Market set-up. I am not surprised at that.<br><br>
As far as I am aware, I was invited to come to this Committee. I was given no indication of what the business was about. The Minister and his opposite number have referred to documents which we have never seen. I was in the Chamber last week when it became apparent that certainly on the Opposition benches hon. Members were not prepared to take part in proceedings because the papers were not available. They were not available because there had been the problem of a printing dispute, which is still going on. As a result of all the uproar that took place and because the Leader of the Opposition demanded that we should not continue with the business, the business had to be changed for this week.<br><br>
Now here we are, on these important matters, being asked to deliberate on a decision of 10th December 1973. This instrument is all we have. My hon. Friend the Member for Watford said to me immediately he come into this Committee that he wanted to know where the documents were, because all he has before him is the same material that I have. Some of us cannot be in a position to decide our attitude on these matters if we have not got the relevant documents to deal with them.<br><br>
If it is right for the Leader of the Opposition to play merry hell, as he did
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0475">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
last Thursday, and demand of the Leader of the House that the proceedings on the Trade Union Bill be suspended, saying that we must have a special debate on Northern Ireland instead, because of the problem of the papers, then I suggest in all seriousness—perhaps the Clerk could advise you; perhaps he could show impartiality; indeed, I am certain that he would—that you should indicate to the Committee, Mr. Chairman, whether you are satisfied that all the relevant documents have been presented to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blaker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Wells. It is a fact that the documents have been available. These documents in front of me are those which I have taken the trouble to collect. They are rather voluminous. I had no trouble getting them from the Vote Office or from the Library. I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman has not made an effort to obtain them himself.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skinner</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must inquire of you, Mr. Chairman, whether you can give any guarantees that if I go down to the Library and to the Vote Office to collect the relevant documents, they will be available for me. My guess is—indeed, it is more than a guess—that they are not available for every member of the Committee. Therefore, as was the case with the Finance Bill last year, when we were concerned with documents that were not exactly, similar but which dealt with Common Market treaties and so on, we cannot continue with our deliberations in this Committee. Not that it will make any difference to the way in which I vote, but I am certain that there are members of the Committee—perhaps one cannot guarantee it on such important matters as this, but there are a few members of the Committee—who are considering whether they should vote in a certain way, based on what they have heard from the Minister on the one hand and from his opposite number on the other.<br><br>
I do not believe that members of the Committee would as a result of what I say, come to a different decision. My view is abundantly clear on this matter, as is yours, Mr. Chairman. But I want to know from you whether this Committee can proceed on the basis that we have been supplied with sufficient documents,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
or that we are in a position to obtain sufficient documents, in order to deliberate fully on these decisions, directives and protocols that have arisen out of our membership of the Common Market. You do not seem anxious, Mr. Chairman, to rise to your feet on this occasion and give us a decision on that matter. What is the position? We have heard from your hon. Friend on the matter, but I am asking the Chair about these documents that we have not been provided with in this Standing Committee. What is the position?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not the function of the Chair to provide hon. Members with their papers. The hon. Member for Blackpool. South (Mr. Blaker) has already indicated that he was able to obtain adequate papers and information. Other hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have considerable piles of paper before them and beside them. I assume, therefore, that other hon. Members have done their homework and have the documents. It is no function of the Chair to provide papers. I suggest that if the hon. Member wishes to get them, he should go and do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skinner</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but I want a guarantee that if I leave this room to go and collect the necessary documents you will not attempt to draw the Committee's proceedings to a close so that by the time I get back to Committee Room 12 the proceedings will have finished. I need that guarantee, so that I can ascertain from the Library and the Vote Office whether they have the necessary documents.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hattersley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If it is any assistance to the hon. Gentleman, I am prepared to give him any guarantee that is necessary for him to leave the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skinner</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but that is not the guarantee that I need from the Chair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Wells. I would be prepared to lend the hon. Member my documents now. Would he like to have them?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skinner</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That might be satisfactory in some circumstances, but then I shall need the opportunity to read them. I can manage to read the documents, but in response to the hon. Member for Harrow, East (Mr. Dykes), who sits there
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0476">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
smiling, I would almost certainly spend my time reading the documents and not going on some gimmick as he did yesterday on British Rail with the head of the division, Sir Richard Way—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Sir Richard Way is a long way from the European Communities (Definition of Treaties) Order. I trust that the hon. Member will address himself to the order. There are many other hon. Members who are seriously interested in this topic from both points of view, and I trust that other hon. Members may seek to catch my eye. Time is running on. It would be unfortunate if the hon. Member did not return to the subject under debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skinner</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Well, what I am attempting to do is not very different from what was done by the Leader of the Opposition during business questions, when, on behalf of his party and the coalition generally, he was claiming that we could not proceed without the necessary documents. That is what the Leader of the Opposition said quite firmly. He was supported, I assume, by you, Mr. Chairman, in that matter. The point I am making is that in this important matter it is necessary for us to be supplied with the necessary documents, that we he told well in advance that the documents are available for us to proceed with them, and that we are able to obtain all the necessary evidence, so that,,hen we meet on the Wednesday morning to discuss this matter we are fully apprised of the contents of all the documents.<br><br>
What I am saying is that this is typical of the way in which the Common Market proceeds. The idea that ordinary back bench Members of Parliament should actually take part in some decision-making is completely contrary to the general attitude of everything that happens with the Common Market. That is why some of us have made our opposition quite clear from the very beginning. So the point I am making is that I think it was only to be expected that we should have this sort of slipshod attitude in which we are not given the precise documents.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member must realise that hon. Members are never given precise documents. It
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
is up to them to go and fetch the documents which they may require from the Vote Office. I am assured that the treaties that we are properly considering are available in the Vote Office now, that they were available in the Vote Office yesterday, and I am further assured that they have been available there for some days past. I must ask the hon. Member to adhere to the matter that is under discussion. Half our time has already expired, and there are many other hon. Members who may be wishing to catch my eye.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skinner</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be getting round to the actual documents themselves, to the actual orders or decisions, but it is a matter of some importance that we are able to know precisely what these questions are. When my hon. Friend the Member for Watford came into this room, he said "What are these things all about?"! turned to my hon. Friend the Member for Middleton and Prestwich (Mr. Jim Callaghan) and he said, "What are they all about?".<br><br>
The idea is that the establishment—and in this case it concerns the Government and to some extent, perhaps to a lesser degree, the Opposition Front Bench spokesmen—had probably decided, along with you, Mr. Chairman, if you got half a chance, to get the thing through on the nod. In fact, you almost did it. I was told, for what it is worth, before I came to this meeting this morning, that on previous occasions when there has been a Statutory Instruments Standing Committee dealing with matters of this kind, the general idea is that somebody moves the motion as quickly as he possibly can, before anyone has got settled down and knows precisely what it is all about, and because the establishment on the other side of the House agree fundamentally with the position, then they—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must ask the hon. Member to confine his remarks to this order and not to ramble off on to proceedings of other Committees considering other orders in the past. I quite appreciate that this procedure is new to the House, that it has been going for only a few weeks, and hon. Members have to get used to it. But the fact that hon. Members who are not members of the Committee are present among us indicates that they may have a wish to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0477">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
catch my eye, and therefore I must ask the hon. Member to behave himself. Mr. Skinner.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skinner</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When you use emotive terms like "behave yourself", it is, of course, a judgment of yours, Mr. Chairman. We could argue for a long time about the question of behaviour. A lot of people have had to use various techniques in this place, and in other places, too, when there has been a terrible weight and a terrible majority to overcome, in order to get the message across. So when you use an emotive phrase like "behave himself", I do not think it gets the Committee very far.<br><br>
I have very strong views on the Common Market. I detest the way in which you, as a Member, not of the Government but of the Government party at that time, dragged Britain into the Common Market without providing an opportunity, as you said you would in your manifesto, to consult the British people. I detest that. Therefore, if you say that I am misbehaving myself in the context of fighting for the rights of the British people, those millions who never had a chance to vote on this matter, then I am prepared to do it for a long time. But I would not say that it is misbehaving. I would say that I am fighting to give the right to my constituents and to the millions in other constituencies—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member is doing no such thing. He is wasting the time of this Committee. He is being thoroughly impertinent to the Chair in reiterating this matter of the Chair's personal former votes. I must point out to him that it is the duty of the Chair to protect the interests of minorities, and indeed it is the pleasure of this particular occupant of the Chair to endeavour to do so.<br><br>
I was very attracted to some of the hon. Member's arguments a few moments ago, until he strayed off again into improper courses—or courses that were out of order, I should say. I must draw the hon. Member's attention to the fact that there are hon. Members from both sides of the House present, including some who are not, I think, members of the Committee, who hold pro- and anti-Common Market views. There is the hon. Member for Mid-Ulster (Mr. Dunlop), a member
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
of a minority party. There are many minorities present in the Committee. The hon. Member does not have a monopoly of doing good in his own eyes. I ask him most earnestly to apply himself to the order before the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raphael Tuck</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Wells. Could you tell us, first, when the document that I have in my hand was laid before Parliament and where it was laid? Was it in the Journal Office? If so, I should like to say something further to my point of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member. In his opening remarks the Minister gave us the precise date on which it was laid.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tuck</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry but I did not hear the Minister. I was delayed by train and had difficulty in arriving here.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To my recollection, the Minister gave us the precise date, a day in June, and it will have been laid in the usual way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tuck</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the Journal Office?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I presume so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tuck</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Wells. With great respect, it seems to me that that is not satisfactory. If it was laid in the Journal Office, that is a small office. There are 635 Members of Parliament, and they cannot be expected to go up every day to find out about orders laid in the Journal Office. There would be a terriffic clutter. I feel that some way should be found of giving hon. Members the information. If I had seen this paper before today, I should, of course, have gone to the documents. But this is the first day I have seen it.<br><br>
It may be default on my part, but I feel that there should be a system whereby hon. Members can know what is going on without having to traipse up to the Journal Office every evening, which they do not have time to do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for raising that point, which I believe to be a serious one. As I said earlier, we are working under new procedures. In fact, the draft statutory instrument that we are considering has been available in the Vote Office itself, not the Journal Office, for some considerable time. Therefore, I think that it has
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0478">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
not been impossible for hon. Members who were seriously interested in the topic to inform themselves. But I appreciate the constructive suggestion made by the hon. Member.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hattersley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Wells. My hon. Friend the Member for Watford (Mr. Tuck) has raised a serious point, and I am happy to do my best to respond to it.<br><br>
I am afraid that in my opening remarks I did not give the Committee the date on which the instrument was laid. I am advised that it was laid on 8th July, about 10 days ago. But the point I went on to make concerned the treaties encompassed in the order, because if we are to debate the subject in the spirit of the hon. Member who led for the Opposition, the hon. Member for Blackpool, South (Mr. Blaker), clearly what the Committee wants to do is talk about the substance of the five treaties.<br><br>
That is the democratic control over the Community which the Committee is intended to provide. I think that it would not be difficult to argue that we are not providing it and have not done so for the last 40 minutes. But if we are to exercise that control, it must be by debating the treaties. Any hon. Member who discovered that he was allocated to the Committee, or, indeed, any hon. Member who requested that he be allocated to the Committee, could easily have obtained the statutory instrument which, as I said, was laid 10 days ago. He could have discovered from its schedule what were the five treaties. Not only were those treaties available in the Record Office in terms of a record of the Community, but they are Command Papers which are obtainable in the way every other official document is obtainable.<br><br>
I simply rise to make absolutely clear that, wherever the responsibility lies, whether with the House or with the Government, the responsibility of providing the papers has been fulfilled. I think that hon. Members who have actually read the papers might feel that they should have an opportunity to say something about them between now and noon.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ronald Bell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think it necessary to say these things on points of order. They are legitimately the subject of speeches.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Do I take it that the hon. and learned Member is rising on a point of order?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. Wells.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skinner</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the need for people to get in and make a point about not being able to know precisely what the Committee is deliberating upon. It seems apparent now from the intrusion by the hon. Member for wherever it is that he, too, is not too clear what the Committee is actually doing. It seems to me now, Mr. Chairman, in view of the utterances asserted by my hon. Friend, and discussions I have had with my two hon. Friends at the back here that they are rapidly coming, or they have come, to the conclusion that what I have been saying about the non-availability of the documents is very important, and it would seem now that you, Mr. Chairman—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dykes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Wells. I apologise for intervening but, in view of the Minister of State's explanation, which is literally accurate and, I think, would be borne out by all objective members of this Committee, and in view of what you have said already to the hon. Member for Bolsover (Mr. Skinner), I wonder whether you could tell me how much longer this Committee has to endure the opportunist idleness of the hon. Member for Bolsover?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skinner</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not quite catch the last two words. Anyway, I shall be able to read it later. My point, Mr. Chairman, is quite serious, and it is now being borne out by my hon. Friends. Even supposing that the documents are available in the places that my hon. Friend has suggested that they are, what I am saying—this will be confirmed by my two hon. Friends behind me, the Members for Middleton and Prestwich (Mr. Callaghan) and for Hemsworth (Mr. Woodall), perhaps others too—is that in this new procedure, especially where it affects new Members of Parliament in particular and in general where it affects everybody, because it is a completely new procedure the establishment should go to extreme and inordinate lengths to see to it that the Committee knows precisely what it is doing. That is what I am saying.<br><br>
I am suggesting that, even though you and others who are very much in favour
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0479">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
of the Common Market do not want to hear these arguments, as a result of my long-winded contributions this morning something will be done on succeeding occasions when this Statutory instruments Committee meets so that hon. Members are fully acquainted with what the documents and these protocols are all about. That is what I am saying. The net result will be that when other new Members are asked to sit on these Standing Committees to deal with matters of this kind, then you will not have—as you undoubtedly will have from other Members of the House of Commons who are against the Common Market—a situation in which they say, "We are not fully acquainted with what the Committee is deliberating upon". So I am asking, arising out of what we have said this morning, that we should have a system operating on this question so that people are fully aware of what is taking place.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dykes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for giving way. Would he say that documents are made—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skinner</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Speak loudly, because I missed it last time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dykes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman say that documents are made available for other Committees—other than this Committee considering these matters—automatically to Members when they are nominated to membership?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skinner</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, what I am saying is something quite different. What I am saying is that here we are in almost a vacuum. My hon. Friend and his right hon. Friend are attempting fundamentally to renegotiate the Common Market. It could be that in a few short months Britain, having been given the chance to vote on this very important matter, will say "No" and we shall be on our way out. I am saying that in this unique situation, in a new constitutional situation when we are developing new techniques in the House perhaps for a short period of time only, when we are developing ways of dealing with directives and all these different kinds of matters, we should be in a position to know precisely how this new machine, if it can be called a machine, will work. That is what I am saying. I reckon—despite the fact that the hon. Member for Harrow,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
East (Mr. Dykes), who is besotted by the question of time as a result of his running about on the railways yesterday—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have already asked the hon. Member to confine himself to the measures and to leave the railway excursions of the hon. Member for Harrow, East (Mr. Dykes) till another time. I would point out to him that for very nearly an hour he has made his point about the availability of documents. It has been pointed out to him that the documents have been available for several days. He is correct to point out that new hon. Members naturally have to find their way about and all of us have to find our way about a new procedure. Having said that, I would ask him yet again to return for a moment or two to the instrument so that other hon. Members, who are anxious to speak, may catch my eye.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alec Woodall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Wells. Am I to understand that the procedure now is that members of this Committee must themselves seek to find documents from the Vote Office?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course that is so. That applies to all Committees and all other business of the House. Hon. Members are expected to be adults and able to look after themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Woodall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Wells. This is the third Committee that I have attended. On the other two I have been provided with documents—copies of Bills, amendments and everything else connected with the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These proceedings are somewhat different from when a Standing Committee is considering a Bill. Naturally, there are amendments and so on and the Bill, too, has to be available.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hattersley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Wells. It is important that the record should not show that a procedure is fundamentally different in this Committee from that in any other Committee. Like my hon. Friend, I have attended and served on many Committees over the past 10 years. The invariable practice is that the principal documents being discussed by that Committee—Bills or anything else—are available on the Table between the two sides of the Committee. The principle document being discussed by this
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0480">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
Committee is on that table today. I intrude again, with apologies, only because I should not like the record to suggest that this Committee of all Committees behaved differently from other Committees.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skinner</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What I am saying is that this is a new technique. I am saying that, because we are dealing with matters affecting our involvement in the Common Market, we should know what these documents are more precisely, and the establishment should go out of its way to see that they are provided. My guess is that, even though we might be in the Common Market for only a short time, somebody should take up this cry and try to provide the Committee with documents dealing with the decisions of the Community which will, we suppose, be adopted by the Council of Ministers, and that hon. Members should be provided with them so that they may be able more easily to weave their way through the morass in which the Common Market is situated.<br><br>
I am against these measures. First, I do not think that the decision should be taken here. I believe that these matters should be dealt with on the Floor of the House. I know that some people would grumble about that, because they would have to stop here longer than they do, and those who are playing truant from time to time with their opposite numbers would have to be here, for some people would have to be here to debate these matters. It might mean that we should have to change the system in the Chamber. But these things must be borne in mind by those who voted to take Britain into the Common Market for this short time.<br><br>
So I am against the order that is being brought before us to deliberate and vote upon today, because it has been pushed upstairs in this autocratic manner by addicts and, as is possibly true now, by a minority of hon. Members. My guess is that if a vote were taken now in the House of Commons its result would be against Britain's membership of the Common Market. To that extent, this Committee is a bit of a fraud.<br><br>
My view is that all matters affecting the Common Market that now come to the Statutory Instruments Standing Committee should be debated on the Floor of the House. Even though they might
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
get only an hour and a half of debate at eleven o'clock at night, or later, they should be considered in that way. We should get a more realistic debate and we should almost certainly get a more realistic idea of the views of back benchers of the Common Market compared with the view of the previous Parliament in Divisions on 28th October 1971 and succeeding occasions.<br><br>
I am against these five measures for that first reason. I am against them for another reason, too. I declare my interest quickly and say that I am a Member of Parliament sponsored by the National Union of Mine Workers, as is my hon. Friend the Member for Hems-worth. The NUM had its annual conference in the first week of July. One motion concerned the Common Market. The discussion went very wide indeed. As a result of that debate at Llandudno, the miners say not only that Britain should withdraw from the Common Market, but that the officials of the National Union of Mineworkers should no longer take part in the arrangements of the European Coal and Steel Community.<br><br>
As you will see and have already noted, Mr. Chairman, three of these measures deal with British participation in the European Coal and Steel Community, one dealing with coal and two with steel. To that extent I have to consider—not that it causes me a great deal of concern—what this new development means not merely to the National Union of Mine-works, but the trade union movement generally.<br><br>
It just so happens that the movement has caught up with me and coincides with my view. So it is not so much of a disability and I do not have to re-orient myself to the new position. It means that matters relating to the coal and steel community will require even more detailed study.<br><br>
Now, backed by the NUM resolution, I am no longer alone in this attitude. My call for Britain to get out of the Common Market is now consistent with opinion in sections of the Labour Party and there is a growing awareness in the trade union movement, to which many of us on this side of the House are affiliated. The unions are now saying that we should get out and the NUM is saying that it does not want to

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 27</span>
send representatives such as Lawrence Daly, Joe Gormley, or any of the others to the European Coal and Steel Community. That is another reason why I am saying quite vehemently—I do not know whether I am misbehaving by saying it—that I am against these measures.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Committee is well aware of the hon. Member's stand, but I must ask him, as I have many times, to address himself to the order before the Committee. It is not in order in dealing with the generality of the Common Market to say where Mr. Gormley or anybody else may stand. I ask the hon. Member to address himself to the draft order before us and I remind him that there are other hon. Members seeking to catch my eye.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skinner</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I realise that, and I hope that my hon. Friends do—I am not concerned with hon. Members opposite. If my hon. Friends do not get long enough to speak on this subject, I hope they will realise that it is not because of my intervention this morning, but because we are restricted to one and a half hours of debate. I am certain that they will come to that conclusion, certainly those who, like me, are against Britain's involvement in this web of intrigue in the Common Market. They understand that it is not me who is preventing them from speaking, but the fact that the establishment in this place has decided that one and a half hours is sufficient for five matters of whatever importance.<br><br>
Although it sounded very quaint and clever for you, Mr. Chairman, to refer to my bringing in Joe Gormley and Lawrence Daly, I have to tell you that it is very germane to the matter in question. here we are with a decision about the European Coal and Steel Community. Until that conference decision in the first week in July, the officials of the NUM were participating in that decision-making. That is no longer the case. The NUM has taken a fundamental decision to tell its officials to come out. Therefore, that is germane to this discussion. But I shall not dwell on that matter too long. I think that I have said enough about that reason why I am against these measures.<br><br>
Another reason is the revelation that I heard from my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Trade. On Monday,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and President of the Board of Trade, in answer to questions, said that Britain was now running an annual trade deficit with the Common Market countries of £2,000 million. In this day and age, when we were being inundated by the Press and other the media with claims that Britain cannot pay her way and that we are in the greatest economic crisis since 1929—some would go further and say that it is worse than the crash of that time—are we seriously allowing ourselves to get more and more involved in the Common Market with a trade deficit of £2,000 million?<br><br>
This is not the trade deficit connected with the payment of the Arab oil. Everybody says that we can ignore that because eventually we shall have our own North Sea oil which will compensate for that massive deficit. However, what I am pointing out is that that £2,000 million trade deficit is in goods, yet we were told, day after day, week after week, month after month, by the Leader of the Opposition, as he now is, and by many other parliamentarians and by almost all the national Press, that we had to join the Common Market because of the economies of scale to be derived from being able to sell our consumer goods to a population of 250 million. That is what the media, the establishment and others were saying when they were trying to brain-wash ordinary people into accepting that joining the Common Market was the only way in which this country could prosper.<br><br>
Two days after that announcement was made by the Secretary of State for Trade and his Under-Secretary, who is here today, we are discussing another five decisions that will get us even more involved in the well of intrigue in the Common Market. So-called parliamentarians are tracking off to Brussels on charter flights at £46 a time, paid by the British taxpayer and the Continental taxpayer—You do not like this—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must remind the hon. Gentleman that he must not make such remarks about what the Chair may like or what the Chair may not like. I must remind him yet again to address his remarks to the order before the Committee and not to make general remarks. I would therefore ask him to draw his
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0482">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 29</span>
observations to a conclusion in a very few minutes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skinner</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What you are really saying, Mr. Chairman, is that from your position, as one who voted for the Common Market—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have already reprimanded the hon. Member with all the force that is available to the Chairman of a Standing Committee. I have said that, despite his conduct in other Committees and elsewhere in the House, he must respect the position of the Chair. I repeat, he must behave himself.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skinner</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I said earlier. "behaving oneself" is an emotive phrase. What you are really concerned about, Mr. Chairman, is that you want to put yourself in a state of limbo while this Committee sits. You are asking me to accept that before you came through the Committee door this morning you could wear your Common Market hat, but the moment you took the Chair, you could take off that Common Market hat, that I had then to regard you for an hour and a half as not interested, not even emotionally, in the benefits of the Common Market, but when you left this room at twelve o'clock, you could put on your pro-Common Market hat and carry on as if nothing had happened. I am seriously suggesting, Mr. Chairman, that you cannot do that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member is well known for his impertinences to various occupants of the Chair of the House and to occupants of the Chairs of Committees. He must also realise that this is a serious debate in which there are other hon. Members, pro and anti, from other minorities, and it is disgraceful that he should seek to monopolise the proceedings of the Committee.<br><br>
I have given him great latitude in being out of order, because it is the responsibility of the Chair to allow latitude to minorities. But he knows perfectly well that he has far overstepped the bounds in which he should contain himself, and I must therefore ask him to draw his remarks to a conclusion within a very few minutes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skinner</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You are sadly wrong about my relationships with chairmen
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
and with Mr. Speaker, because there is no—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am not interested in hearing any more of the hon. Member's view on his relationship with occupants of the Chair. I am interested in hearing a debate on the order before the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skinner</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have to tell you, Mr. Chairman, that when I sat on the Housing Finance Bill for five months, at the end of the debate—and it is available to be read by any Member—the chairman, Mr. Godman Irvine, complimented me on my conduct.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are not discussing the Housing Finance Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skinner</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point that I am trying to make, Mr. Chairman, is that Mr. Godman Irvine thought that he would have a difficult time reconciling his views on various matters with mine. At the end of the five months he reached the conclusion that we had done a reasonably good job between us, and I got a pat on the head for it. So you should not get terribly excited about the fact that someone who does not fall into line with your views is present on a Committee and is trying to get a message across.<br><br>
To sum up; there is now a new development in the trade union movement against the Common Market I oppose the order because we have not been supplied with the documents we should have had on this new kind of Committee. It should have been debated on the Floor of the House where every Member of Parliament would have an opportunity to argue these matters. I am against it because it is now apparent that Britain's involvement in the Common Market is now showing itself to be of such critical importance, for we are up to the neck in debt and most of that debt is attributable to our involvement in the Common Market, and it is a debt to the tune of £2,000 million.<br><br>
I oppose the order because I do not agree with the system by which these decisions reach the House of Commons. I disapprove of the fact that people can be paid £27 a day not for dining at the Savoy, but when they are 300 miles away and someone else—another so-called Member for Parliament—signs in their
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0483">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 31</span>
name with a different coloured pencil in order that they may do so.<br><br>
That is why I am against provisions of this kind, Mr. Chairman. It may be unpalatable to you in your position, notwithstanding that of course for one and a half hours you are extremely impartial.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jim Spicer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Wells. I am a new Member of the House and I share with the hon. Member for Hemsworth (Mr. Woodall) some concern that in the past, purely because we were new, we have not found our way around. I shall certainly do so—I hope that, perhaps, we can do so together—and find the right documents the next time the Committee meets. But it seems to me, Mr. Wells, and I think to most members of the Committee, whether they are in favour of the Community or not, that there are five issues before us today. The first concerns an on-going agreement—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is not a point of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spicer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I just complete what I intended to say? We have five issues before us. We have not heard one word on any of those five issues which are of vital importance, not to the European Community but to the developing world and to the people who need help from us. I do not give a tuppeny toss how that help is given, provided it is given. We have the perfect opportunity to discuss the matter today. I deplore, as I am certain every other member of the Committee will deplore, the way in which this whole proceeding has been occupied for the past hour by the hon. Member for Bolsover (Mr. Skinner).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Wells. As it is now 10 minutes to 12, I think it would be a pity if a good point were obscured by the bad way in which it was being made. I should like to raise with you the question of the documents, which has some substance which has been somewhat destroyed by the activities of the hon. Member for Bolsover (Mr. Skinner).<br><br>
There are five treaties here. The instrument was laid 10 days ago. I submit to you, for the consideration of all concerned, that this is not a satisfactory
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
procedure. First, how is one to get hold of the treaties?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must tell the hon. and learned Member that this matter was dealt with by the Minister and by other hon. Members at some length before he came into the Committee. The papers are available in the Vote Office in the usual way, and, because the hon. and learned Member did not happen to hear that, I do not think that I can hear him any longer on this point of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On that point of order, Mr. Wells, with respect, I am aware of what you have just told me. I am not saying that the papers are not available in the Vote Office. Of course they are. Indeed, in another capacity I am on a Committee which considers these things, and we do get them. The point I wanted to make is that this Committee, performing its function, should have assistance which makes it possible for us to get them. One has the treaties. But hon. Members will see they concern coal and steel, tariffs on steel products, another on steel products, the extension of the Food Aid Convention, and lastly the protocol extending the Wheat Trade Convention.<br><br>
I submit to you, Mr. Wells, that it is impossible for hon. Members who have their various duties in this place to discharge to equip themselves in a maximum period of nine days, if they instantly get off the mark, not merely on the text of those treaties but on their relevance as to whether they should become designated as Community treaties under Section 1 of the European Communities Act, from which definition considerable legal consequences flow.<br><br>
I submit that the right way for it to be done would be for working documents to be provided to hon. Members nominated to serve on the Committee, that is, documents dealing with the significance of these matters and the questions of policy for us which are raised by the proposed definition of these treaties. I do not honestly see how we can discharge our functions otherwise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jim Callaghan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Wells. I have been trying for some considerable time to catch your eye on this matter. Initially, I did not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0484">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 33</span>
seek to become a member of the Committee. The only document I have received which informs me what the Committee is about is this small document. I am not aware of the procedures of the House. I have learned here this morning that documents are available. But on other Committees that I have attended I have been provided with a document. I thought it was the usual procedure—as in local government, when local government officials always see that one has a brief.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I appreciate the sincerity of the hon. Member's point, and I appreciate that he is unaware of the procedure, but we cannot go on likening Parliament to local government; nor can we go on discussing the position of hon. Members who have been here a long time—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Callaghan</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order—or, equally, those recently elected, in their ignorance of the whereabouts of documents. All hon. Members, including the representative of the Patronage Secretary and Ministers on the Front Bench, have heard the valid comments of three hon. Members about the need for documents to be made available to hon. Members, and I am sure that note will have been taken of it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tuck</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Wells. In view of what has happened today and the fact that no hon. Member has had a chance, except my hon. Friend the Member for Bolsover (Mr. Skinner), to address himself to this important order, it would be preposterous to send it to the House in its present state. Would it be possible to continue the hearing on another day so that hon. Members may have a chance of expressing themselves?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dykes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Wells. The hon. Member for Watford (Mr. Tuck) is suggesting that, provided it can be arranged that the hon. Member for Bolsover (Mr. Skinner) and his hon. Friends can come along to filibuster in future, the decision will always be postponed. That is the hon. Member's proposition.<br><br>
On the point of order raised by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Bell), could we have your guidance, Mr. Wells? I found no
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 34</span>
difficulty in getting any of the documents. It is normal procedure for Members to obtain the documents themselves and not to be spoon-fed in respect of all Committees. There is no difference, as the Minister said, in documentation on this Committee. Would it not be right for you, Mr. Wells, to suggest to those hon. Members who were too dilatory and idle to obtain the documents for themselves to do so on future occasions?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I had already done so, in tactful terms more suitable to the occupant of the Chair.<br><br>
In reply to the serious point of order raised by the hon. Member for Watford (Mr. Tuck), I have to say that unfortunately it is not possible. As we are so nearly at the end of our time, I take this opportunity to point out that any vote taken in the Committee is ineffectual as the substantive vote is taken in the House. Although hon. Members will not have the opportunity of debating it further, I am required by Standing Order 73A to report the instrument to the House.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Wells. Surely, it is possible for us to vote against the motion that the Committee has considered the order. What follows that I do not know, but it is a course of action available to us. We have, through the proceedings of the Committee, lost our right to debate it in the House. We have not been able to debate it here. I take slight umbrage at the phrase "dilatory and idle". It is quite wrong. I know perfectly well where to get the papers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dykes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why did you not?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend did not listen. I am grumbling not about the non-availability of the papers but about the fact that there are five Treaties on which we should have working memoranda. No Select Committee would dream of dealing with the treaties in this procedure, and note should be taken of this for our future benefit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hattersley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Wells. Since I suspect that the proceedings of this Committee may be reported rather more widely than Statutory Instrument Committees normally are, I should like to make two points about procedural matters.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0485">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 35</span>
The hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Bell) is quite wrong to say that the Committee has prevented the House from discussing these matters. It was the instruction of the House that they should be discussed by the Committee, and, as servants of the resolution of the House, we are doing our best to carry it out.<br><br>
Second, as regards my hon. Friends' suggestions that an explanatory document should be prepared, the Government have to abide by the normal rules and procedure of the House. This is a Statutory Instrument Committee governed by the rules that govern all such Committees. The fact that it is a matter concerning the European Economic Communities does not alter those rules.
