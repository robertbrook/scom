	<div class='page-header'><h1>LAND TENURE REFORM (SCOTLAND) BILL [	<i>LORDS</i>]</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That if the proceedings on the Land Tenure Reform (Scotland) Bill [Lords] are not completed at this day's sitting, the Committee do meet on Thursday next at half-past Ten o'clock.—[	<i>Mr. William Ross.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. William Ross)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee have considered the Land Tenure Reform (Scotland) Bill [Lords] relating to the principle of the Bill.</p></blockquote>
The subject matter of the Bill is already familiar to many of us who took part in the deliberations on a Bill with the same Title which was introduced by the previous administration in November, 1973, and which had passed through all its stages in the Commons and had received a Second Reading in another place before the Dissolution of Parliament in February of this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We on this side of the Committee gave a broad welcome to that earlier Bill, although we criticised it for its very tardy appearance and because it did not, in our view, go nearly far enough. In view of the delay which had already occurred, the present Government felt that it was important to ensure that this legislation reached the Statute Book as soon as possible. Rather than taking further time in discussions in relation to a longer and more complex Bill and to work out the considerably more extensive proposals which we should like to see, we thought it right to introduce this Bill, which is generally based on its predecessor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have, nevertheless, been able to improve it in a number of important respects, with the result that the Bill which we are considering today goes a good deal further in the direction of getting rid of feuduties. To that extent it will bring about a much speedier end to this
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
quite outdated annual payment. It will, at the same time, simplify in a number of ways the further legislation which is needed to abolish the feudal system entirely—which remains our aim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In these circumstances, it is not necessary for me to take up the time of the Committee by describing all the provisions of the Bill in detail, but I should like to say a word or two about the two main features of it. The first relates to the primary purpose of the Bill, dealt with in Clause 1, to prohibit the creation of new feuduties. The previous administration's Bill contained a provision whereby in new feus there was still to be a feuduty of one penny, if asked. I remember my right hon. Friend the Lord Advocate criticising that at the time as a "feudal fiction." Other hon. Members, including my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Doig), pointed out the difficulties that might arise from the retention of a feuduty, however small, even although it was intended to be of a purely nominal nature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason for this somewhat curious proposal was that some nominal money payment was thought to be essential to preserve the feudal link between proprietor and superior, until such time as the feudal system as a whole could be abolished. The present Government accept that it is necessary to keep this link, although as a purely temporary arrangement—for example, in connection with the enforcement of land conditions, which can often be as much in the proprietor's interest as the superior's. We propose, however, to do this in such a way that it is not necessary to have any feuduty in future feus. This means that Clause I of the Bill, unlike its predecessor, really does prohibit new feuduties completely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second major improvement which we have introduced into the Bill is even more far-reaching. We have provided in Clause 5 for the compulsory redemption of feuduty on the first sale of a property. This will greatly speed up the phasing out of the whole money side of the fuedal system. I understand that in Scotland about 75,000 houses change hands each year, and most of these properties are subject to feuduty. This compulsory redemption will be carried out by the person who sells the property, and the redemption price will be calculated by the same formula, in Clause 4(2), related to the price of 2½ per cent. Consols—
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0191">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
as applies in the case of voluntary redemption of feuduty by a proprietor, for which the Bill, like its forerunner, also contains provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am satisfied that these arrangements will be fair to all concerned. The person redeeming the feuduty will have money in his hands from the sale of his property. It is the seller who is responsible for the transaction. The redemption formula will produce an equivalent income for the superior calculated in accordance with current interest rates. The effect will be that just as a person buying a new house will not in future find that his property has been burdened by some new feuduty or other perpetual money payment, so the person who buys an existing property will find that any individual feuduty with which that property has been burdened in the past is redeemed before he goes into it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the greatly increased turnover of house property in recent years in Scotland, this will make an immediate and sizeable impact on the wiping out of existing feuduties; to that extent it is a major step forward towards our ultimate goal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now go very briefly through the parts of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Teddy Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Secretary of State continues, will he deal with one point? What will be the position if the sale of the property relates to the compulsory purchase by a local authority of a property of which the owner has disappeared, or of whom there is no trace?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will deal with that point. The hon. Member will probably find that it will be covered by something that I shall say about compulsory purchase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part I deals with the prohibition of future feuduties and the redemption of existing feuduties. The main clauses are Clause 1, with which I have already dealt; Clause 4, which gives any proprietor —and remember it is the proprietor, not the superior, who has the right— if he so wishes, the right to redeem his feuduty at any term of Whitsunday or Martinmas; and Clause 5 dealing with the compulsory redemption of existing feuduties on a sale. I should perhaps also mention Clause 6, which perhaps covers the point which the hon. Gentleman raised. It extends the compulsory redemption provisions to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
case where land is acquired by an authority possessing compulsory purchase powers—for example, in the course of redevelopment of one of the older parts of a town. In this case, the redemption of feuduty will become the responsibliity of the compulsory purchasing authority, and so it will cover the case that the hon. Gentleman mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part II of the Bill, which limits the residential use of property let under future long leases, is in substantially the same form as the corresponding part of the previous administration's Bill, and I do not think it should give rise to any controversy. Basically, the purpose of Part II is to restrict future long residential leases to a maximum term of 20 years. This will, in effect, implement one of the points in the seven-point plan which the previous Labour Government put forward in a White Paper, "Land Tenure in Scotland", published in July, 1969.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an important element of the Bill. It is essential that we should legislate to prohibit long residential leases at the same time as we abolish feuduty, because the long residential lease could easily be used by a landowner as a means of getting round the ban on feuduties. From the point of view of the prospective owner of a house, it would be of little comfort to get rid of feuduty, and then find himself subject to an annual payment, virtually an annual rent, under, say, a 99-year lease. Indeed, he would be even worse off because he would never really own his house at all, and at the end of the day it would revert to the landlord.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This brings me to the other reason why it is essential to prohibit long residential leases—the serious social difficulties to which these leases can give rise, to which, indeed, they have given rise in practice in the past, not just in England and Wales, but in Scotland. Hon. Members who were here at the time will recollect that we had to introduce a special measure in 1954 to deal with questions of long leases falling-in in the Lanarkshire area, the village of Stonehouse and other places. We thought that there were no long leases in Scotland; then we discovered that there was a considerable number, even extending up into Aberdeenshire, Ayrshire, Lochmaben and so on. The Bill produced on the basis of the formula gave the right to change those leases into feuduties provided it was done within five years; most people did.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. G. D. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether 20 years is long enough, or whether it should be allowed to be the lifetime of the lessee. What would be wrong in a lease between a lessor and a lessee which extended for the life of the lessee? Presumably the lessee would have agreed to it otherwise. Would the right hon. Gentleman consider that aspect?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am prepared to consider that. We have looked at the number of years— 20, 30, 40 or 50. One has to draw a reasonable line which shows clearly the intentions behind the legislation. If one goes beyond that, the lifetime may be considerable; and one could find oneself virtually back to the troublesome 99-year lease. One must keep it within a manageable period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The long residential lease is not at present common in Scotland, though there are some. We must make absolutely sure that landowners do not switch into this form of tenure when they can no longer impose feuduties. What we are proposing is in line with the previous administration's Bill, and I think there will be general agreement on all sides of the Committee that these provisions are right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part III of the Bill deals with miscellaneous matters. Some of the clauses in this Part are included to prevent possible methods of evading the restrictions imposed by Parts I and II. No doubt, there are people who will seek to do that, and we have sought to obviate it in advance. Other clauses make desirable technical changes, mainly in relation to leases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part IV is largely formal. I would, however, draw attention to the proposed commencement date of the Bill which under Clause 24(2), is to be 1st September, 1974. We want to ensure that the prohibition of new feuduties and the compulsory redemption of existing feu-duties when property is sold begin to bite as soon as possible. The proposed date will also mean that proprietors who wish to exercise their right to redeem their feuduties voluntarily will have ample time to make the necessary arrangements to do so at Martinmas 1974, which is 11th November. It is particularly important that this right should be available at the next term-day, because I understand that, partly in anticipation
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
of the Bill, increasing numbers of superiors are already giving proprietors the opportunity of redeeming their feuduties on a variety of terms, not all of which are as favourable to the proprietors as the redemption formula contained in the Bill. This situation is likely to give rise to doubt and confusion in the minds of many proprietors, so that the sooner the statutory terms and their rights are known and made available to them the better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise that there is nothing in the Bill which will allow the superior in any circumstances to dictate when redemption of a feuduty is to take place. The proprietor may choose to redeem his feuduty if he so wishes at any Whitsunday or Martinmas, and if the proprietor decides to sell his property he must then redeem the feuduty. If the Bill were in operation today, the redemption formula in Clause 4(2) would work out at about 6½ times the amount of the annual feuduty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, I stress that the Bill is the second stage of the Government's overall programme of land tenure reform, as set out in the 1969 White Paper. The first stage was the enactment of the Conveyancing and Feudal Reform (Scotland) Act 1970 which, amongst other things gave proprietors the right to apply to the Lands Tribunal for Scotland for the variation or discharge of unreasonable or obstructive land conditions. I understand that proprietors have already derived considerable advantage from this provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The primary purpose of the Bill is to deal effectively with the money side of the feudal system. There remains the final winding-up of the system as a whole, with which are inextricably linked future arrangements in relation to the creation and enforcement of land conditions. The Government's intention is to bring forward further legislation on this as soon as practicable. In the meantime, I commend the Bill to the Committee. It has already passed through its stages in another place and I hope that we can give it a fair wind to allow it to reach port soon, after its somewhat erratic voyage through the vicissitudes of Parliament with its dissolutions and elections.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
the Bill and for his explanation of its clauses. We on this side obviously welcome the reintroduction of the Bill because with two exceptions, one relatively minor and one more major, it is identical to the Bill which we produced when we were in government and which I am glad to see the party opposite has adopted as its legislation now. I congratulate them for it. It is very much to the credit of my party when we were in government that the incoming government have seen fit to put forward. almost identically the same Bill and, obviously with great enthusiasm, to judge from the right hon. Gentleman's speech this morning. We take credit for initiating this important step in the reform of feudal tenure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like in passing to pay my personal tribute to the previous Lord Advocate, Lord Wylie, who was very much involved in the drafting and preparation of the previous Bill and in its passage through the House before the General Election. I am sure that he will read the reports of the Committee with interest to see what is said this morning and what was said when we last debated this in the Grand Committee in November last year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate (Mr. Ronald King Murray)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to associate this side of the Committee with the tribute which the hon.

But may I take it from his own enthusiasm, which he has expressed today, that he will do all in his power to ensure that this time the Bill actually goes through and becomes part of this country's legislation? I hope that all other Members of the Committee will co-operate in that respect also.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is not a matter for me; it is a matter for the Government to decide how their own business is carried out. It is up to the Government, if they want to see the Bill carried on to the Statute Book, to make sure that they have the facilities in the parliamentary programme and, indeed, to ensure that the programme is long enough to cope with it. We certainly shall do nothing to hinder the Bill in reaching the Statute Book, as this is the second attempt. We want to see it become law, because we believe that it is of considerable benefit to the many people in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
I do not intend to speak for very long this morning because I know that a number of others want to speak, and we have debated the Bill at considerable length before. However, I could not let the occasion pass without looking, as indeed the right hon. Member for Kilmarnock (Mr. Ross) looked the last time this was debated, at some of the things said on previous occasions. After having listened to the speech of the right hon. Gentleman the Secretary of State this morning, anticipating the speech of the Lord Advocate which I hope we shall hear later on this morning, I must confess that, looking back at the debate of 20th November, I find some of the things said on that occasion slightly amusing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I remember rightly, the Lord Advocate described our Bill as "a wretched little Bill." He referred to it as a "mini-Bill" and even, when it reached the Third Reading with a number of alterations and some very constructive improvements, he still felt compelled to express his extreme disappointment at it. Yet, this morning the Government came forward with virtual the Government come forward with virtually the same Bill. I wonder what has happened to change their attitude from one of extreme disappointment three months ago to one of pleasure and pride in the Bill which they are bringing forward this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One thing that interested me about the Lord Advocate's speech on that occasion was that he said that there were thousands of people in Scotland waiting for this, that this was the lifebelt being thrown to the drowning man by the then Tory Government, and, instead of a lifebelt, it was just an old rubber tyre. All I can say is that if it was an old rubber tyre, it certainly has not received much of a retread in the few months that have elapsed. The Bill is virtually exactly the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, the right hon. Member for Kilmarnock said at that time as reported in column 45 of the OFFICIAL REPORT, that he believed there were thousands of people in Scotland who felt they were let down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would he tell us today how many thousands of people in Scotland may still feel that they are let down? I notice that he did not use that kind of remark in commending the Bill to the Committee. Again he finished his speech on that day saying that the Bill deserved "the censure of the Committee." We did not hear any
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0194">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
phrase such as that from the right hon. Gentleman this morning, calling for censure from the Committee. Instead he commended it to the Committee for its support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All I can say, comparing what was said on that previous occasion with what has been said this morning, is that a great deal of hypocrisy and hot air came from the other side of the Committee when the Bill was debated earlier. We welcome the Bill. We are glad that the Government have taken it on, and we hope that they will show more enthusiasm for it, now that it is their Bill, than they showed when this was debated in Committee and in the House earlier this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I now turn to the two main changes that have taken place in the Bill. The first is in relation to the abolition of the 1p feu. We debated it at length, and Lord Wylie at that time took up the question of irritancy raised by the hon. Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Doig). The Bill was improved considerably, as I am sure the hon. Member for Dundee, West will admit. His criticisms were very much acted upon, and tribute was paid to him in the later stages of the Bill for the improvements he had made. This still left the question of the 1p feu. The Government have now, in proposing to abolish this 1p feu, replaced what they described and criticised on that occasion as a feudal fiction with what I would describe on this occasion as a legal fiction. Honestly, it is just a substitution of one fiction for another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall certainly not oppose it. If the Government believe this is possible and they believe it is worth while doing, then so let it be. I just say to the Committee that I think it is important in legal terms, in order to ensure that the land condition is enforced, to have this connection between the actual legal condition and the payment of a feu although that feu-duty is very small and in our Bill was only required to be paid if asked. It was, of course, of very little importance indeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What worries me is that when we exchange this feudal fiction for a legal fiction, it leads to some very strange words as far as drafting is concerned. I simply refer to Clause 1 (i) of the Bill:
	<br><blockquote><p>"but a deed executed after that date which contains a grant of land in feu shall have effect otherwise as if the grant were subject to a feuduty."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
In terms of the pure drafting of the clause, I can imagine that if we on this side of the Committee when we were in government had put forward a provision like that, the right hon. Member for Kilmarnock would have taken two days in Committee to debate the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"otherwise as if the grant were subject to a feudity"</p></blockquote>
to establish what it really means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I do not intend to pursue it any further this morning. I believe that in legal terms it creates a fiction of what the Government are doing. We do not intend to oppose it, because the change is very small.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now move on to the second change that has taken place—that is, the provision in Clause 5 for the compulsory redemption of feuduty on the first sale of the property after the passage of the Bill. We welcome this unreservedly from this side of the Committee. It was a matter which Lord Wylie was considering during the passage of the last Bill. The General Election has helped in giving more time for consideration as to how it can be brought forward in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to raise one point, on which I hope the Lord Advocate will be able to reassure us when he winds up later on. In Clause 5 the responsibility for the compulsory redemption of the feu is laid on the seller of the property. It is probably right. I should like to ask the right hon. and learned Gentleman is whether he is satisfied—I am not a lawyer and I should be grateful for his assurances on the point—that there is full protection for the purchaser of the property to make absolutely certain that the feu has been redeemed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There could be cases arising analagous to the case which my hon. Friend raised a moment ago in an intervention where a person, having sold the property, cleared off. The person who purchased the property, because of the terms of the Bill, may believe that the onus is on the seller of the property to make sure that the feu is redeemed and may find subsequently that it has not been done and he cannot trace the superior, who has perhaps disappeared. I should like to know what reassurance there is if such a situation arose, in which the purchaser of the property in all honesty thought he was buying it free of feu, and later found that it had not been carried out and the person
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0195">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
who sold the property had cleared off. I should like to know what protection there is, and whether the right hon. and learned Gentleman is satisfied that the protection is adequate for the purchaser of the property to ensure that the feu has been redeemed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to ask the Secretary of State one more question. The Lord Advocate may be able to deal with it at the end of the debate this morning. What are the Government's intentions on the further stages of the reform of land tenure? I thought the right hon. and learned Gentleman was rather vague this morning as to what the Government's timetable is. We know what their general intentions are. They are exactly the same as the intentions of my hon. Friends—that is, the eventual abolition of the feudal system in Scotland. We are all interested to know what timetable the Government envisage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman put us under considerable pressure when we last debated it on 20th November. The right hon. Gentleman said: "What is required now 1S decision …" [OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Scottish Grand Committee</i>, 20th November, 1973; 	<i>c</i>. 48.] He spoke in strong words calling for decisions from us. I put the question back to him this morning. What is required from him now equally is decision. We want to know what is in his mind concerning the future programme of reform of land tenure in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one thing which I should particularly like to know, in the light of what the hon. Gentleman said. I took down the words and phrases which he used. He simply said "as soon as practicable". That covers a multitude of sins—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sins?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, sins of omission, any length of programme. This is something which should be approached carefully because this system of land conditions—of private planning so far as land development is concerned—adds a great deal to planning generally in Scotland, and in certain areas—in particular in the protection of the interests of particular citizens and groups of citizens—has done much to ensure that certain monstrosities have not been constructed and certain things have not happened which might otherwise destroy the whole
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
atmosphere and appearance of a community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I hope that when the Government come forward with their proposals for the final reform, they will try to adopt what is good out of the existing system. I believe that there is a lot of good in it. It would be a pity to lose that in any more radical final reform that may take place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman arguing that the planning controls are inadequate? Is he saying that there were a number of things done under the land conditions of the feudal system which it is impossible to do through the planning legislation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that there are cases—Lord Wylie referred to them in the debate on the last occasion—where, because of private land conditions, individual householders in a particular area were able to stand up against the planning committee in cases where sometimes the decisions of planning committees—in the eyes of wider community, not perhaps in the eyes of the local authority—were not necessarily in the best interests of that community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the kind of free society that I believe we should have in this country it is a very useful check on the actions of a public authority, that certain aspects of this private planning should be maintained. I believe that there is a case—certainly in the kind of society that I want to see in Britain today—for these two systems running in parallel. It does no harm to have one as a check on the other. Sometimes the check is one way, sometimes the other way. I believe that it gives to the ordinary individual citizen, in certain circumstances, much greater control and a greater say over the kind of community in which he will live and the kind of environment he will have. There are many people in many places in Scotland who have every right to be thankful for the fact that we have had this system in the past.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Sillars</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The majority of my constituents are not feudal superiors who can exercise restraint over the planning authorities, such as the hon. Gentleman is talking about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They may be unfortunate in not having the opportunity,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0196">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
through land conditions, to be able to exercise this kind of control over the kind of community in which they live. It is a very good thing when people feel that they have the opportunity to exercise this kind of influence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I now ask one final question of the right hon. and learned Gentleman about the kind of programme that he envisages and how he sees the next stage of the reform of land conditions in relation to the registration of title? Lord Wylie gave some indication of our thinking on this on the Third Reading of the previous Bill. The whole question of registration of title is one which, having talked with those who have to deal with the registration of title at the moment in Register House in Edinburgh, gives them considerable cause for concern because of their pressure of work. There is absolutely no doubt that there could be many improvements to the system if measures were brought in on the registration of title.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an argument here as to whether the registration of title should precede the next stage of the reform of land tenure conditions, or whether it should come afterwards. Our feeling, when we were in government, was that, on balance, it probably should precede it, because in many ways it would facilitate the next stage of the reform of land tenure conditions if that were carried out first. It would be helpful to those on the Committee and outside, so that not only those with a personal interest because they were subject to land tenure conditions of one sort or another but also those in the legal profession and those dealing with land generally could know what future programme is in the Government's mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Bill and hope to see its rapid passage through this House. We in the Opposition will do all we can to help it on its way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.6 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Doig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted that this Bill has come forward again. This has been a long story. The feudal system, after all, is even older than the oldest part of this Palace of Westminster, and that is very old indeed. There has never been any logic in it; there still is not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
Over the years there have been attempts by many people, particularly back bench Members on Fridays, to alter the system. I can remember the hon. Member for Rutherglen (Mr. Mackenzie) one Friday, and a former Liberal Member for Aberdeenshire, trying it. I can remember half-hearted attempts by successive Governments to do it. Each took us a small stage along the road. The last Labour Government made the first fairly substantial step, followed by the last Conservative Government. The first Bill as it was presented by them took us very slightly further along the road, but in the middle of the Bill, to the consternation of his own supporters, Lord Wylie took it upon himself to start extending the Bill substantially further than they had ever intended. Whether it was because of the logic of the case we put up or for some other reason, I do not know. I like to think that it was the logic of our case that made him realise that the Government had to go much further than they had intended. By the time we had forced it through Committee, it was substantially in excess of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now we have this Bill which takes us still a stage further. But we are by no means at the end of the road even with this Bill. I welcome wholeheartedly the abolition of this obnoxious penny nominal feuduty and all the ridiculous troubles it could lead to, but I am still not satisfied about the formula for redeeming the feuduty by the existing proprietor. The system of a sum of money equivalent to 2½ per cent. consolidated stock, as I have said in earlier debates, means an 	<i>x</i> amount of money, and people may or may not know how much it will be to redeem their feuduty. When a thing is uncertain, some people tend to put it off in the belief that a sum of money required in the future will be even less. Others put it off not knowing whether it will be less or greater, or even how much it will be. They would far rather have a system even if it resulted in a slightly higher payment, by which they could know well in advance how much they had to pay. Whether that was seven, eight, nine or 10 times the nominal feuduty, it would still seem preferable to know on the spot the exact sum and not this fantastic formula of 2½ per cent. consolidated stock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We might well find, for example, that there was a sudden change. We have had sudden changes in the stock market
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0197">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
before. One might apply to redeem one's feuduty and suddenly find that there had been a sudden change in the value of that stock, so that one could buy off one's feuduty for practically nothing, or, on the other hand, that one was paying far more than one had intended to pay for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I still think we should not work on a mystical system that few people outside and, in fact, few people inside, understand. We should make it crystal clear for people to know exactly how much they should pay. If we can work out a sum of seven or eight times the existing feuduty and say that that is the figure, everybody will understand exactly how much they have to pay to do this. That would be a far better way, even if it meant paying slightly more than under this system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other thing that I dislike about this is that the existing feuduties still remain. In many debates I have been told of the good that can come from having this power invested in an autocratic individual with no legal rights to that power, other than the old rights under this old feudal system. Elected by nobody, in 99 cases out of 100 that person has no interest whatever in the conditions that apply in the area, and he is not concerned about the amenities of the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In most cases, he has not lived there in his life, he has probably visited it once or twice, and he has no particular concern about it. His only interest in it is as a method for lining his own pockets. In other words, he uses these conditions to produce financial gain for himself. That happens far more often than the instances in which the few superior tries to preserve or improve the amenities of an area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is wrong that we should give to someone who was not elected the power to do this sort of thing, to impose conditions that are impossible by law, over and above whatever a planning committee decides. I know that the previous Labour Government modified this power by saying that they would give a right of appeal to the Lands Tribunal, and that is now possible, but I would ask the Committee to consider the justice of any individual, not having been elected by anyone to look after the public interest, being given this power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To take one case, Lord Dundee has this power over the whole area in which I live. I am certain that he has no interest in my area or the amenities in it. I have never seen him in there, and I
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
doubt very much whether he goes there very often, unless he happens to be passing through. As it is not on a main road, it is unlikely that he does even that. I have never once heard from even the oldest inhabitants round about of his coming along to investigate anybody's complaint.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This applies not only in my own area, but in many other areas. The cases in which they have performed something useful are frequently talked about, but never quoted. I have never heard a case quoted, in this or any other Committee, showing some useful function performed by the feu superior in this way. I am not saying there are not any, there may be some and perhaps there were some about 100 years ago, but I doubt whether there are any today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The system lends itself to abuse and I hope that we still may do something about it in the Bill. The present administration, like the previous Government, can, by the very logic of the case, sometimes in the middle of a Bill be persuaded to go back further than they had originally intended. I hope that the logic of this case will influence the Government to do something to remove this condition. I am certain that changes will inevitably come, and I hope that we shall take the next step along the road towards getting rid of this ridiculous feudal system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is any deficiency in the present publicly-elected planning committees we should put that right in the proper way, by legislation. We have the powers to do that. This would be a sensible way to do it, because the people taking the decisions would be answerable to the public. No feu superior is answerable to the public. If he uses his powers in a wrong way, there is no way of voting him out of his feu superiorship, so there is no way of dealing with the abuse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like somebody, for the first time in my lifetime, to put to me a case in which a feu superior has used these powers, which we are told are so important, to benefit the community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be very brief as I have no desire to repeat the speech made that I made on the previous Bill. I want to make only three short comments. First, I welcome the Bill,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0198">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
but, on the other hand, I should like to say that the remarks made at the outset of his speech by the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) in criticism of both the Lord Advocate and the Secretary of State were very fair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On reading what they said about the Bill when it was introduced by the Conservative Party, one is astounded to find that it is the same piece of legislation that we are dealing with some months later; they now appear to be as pleased with what they have produced as they were displeased with the same thing before. Perhaps this is a party game, but it is not a game in which I rejoice greatly. Perhaps it is rather more the sort of game that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor) likes to play. I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman is not here to hear that, but I dare say he will return to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should first like to turn to the question of what happens next, because this question has been asked repeatedly. It was asked all through the progress of the previous Bill, and no answer was given. Surely the same people who asked the questions before are now in a position to answer them. In other words, when can we expect legislation to do away with the imposition of conditions on land? That is very important in my part of the world.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I, in fairness, refer the hon. Gentleman to the remarks made by Lord Wylie as he now is on Third Reading, when he was very specific about the programme that we in the Conservative Party envisaged for the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He was reasonably specific, but I should not go much further than that. I expect the Lord Advocate to be absolutely specific when he winds up today because this is extremely important, particularly in the North-East and in the Highlands of Scotland where one is dealing with large areas of land which, in many cases because of the industrial upheaval there, are changing hands quite a bit. There is no doubt that people are still seeking to impose all sorts of conditions on land with a view not, with great respect to the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith), to benefiting the community, but
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
of making sure that they screw the last drop of cash that they can out of the land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me give an example. I am dealing with an interesting case in my own constituency at the moment involving two contiguous plots of land. Let us call them plot A and plot B. A firm wishes to buy a site. It is regarded as necessary in the interests of the community that should obtain one, so the firm buys a site on plot B. Unfortunately, however, the planning committee decides that, because A and B are going out on a road, it is better that plot A should be developed first, so it refuses planning consent for plot B. Therefore, the firm is driven back to the owner of plot A, and immediately he discovers that his is the only for which planning consent is likely to be given he bangs in a whole series of conditions which the firm will have to meet if it proceeds to buy his land for use as a site.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a specific example in which, with respect to the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns, the conditions laid down are not for the benefit of the community. The planning committee has already decided democratically that this area is to be developed and it has laid down its own conditions, but the further conditions which are being specified, many of them quite onerous, are laid down so that the individual concerned can look forward to the prospect of a feu waiver on a subsequent payment of money at a later date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Secretary of State look into the crystal ball and tell us what will happen? Suppose my constituent comes to an agreement, takes over the land and accepts the conditions as laid down. Will the new legislation, which one hopes the Secretary of State will soon be able to introduce, affect this in any way? Or will this be retrospective legislation, with which many do not accord? I think that Members of Parliament should begin to be in a position to advise constituents to hold back, if necessary, from signing specific feus of this sort and committing themselves to conditions which, even when the Government bring forward further proposals, will presumably be unaffected and perpetuated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should very much appreciate it if the Lord Advocate could say something, first, about when he thinks the final wind up of the feudal system will come, and, secondly, how the people who at
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0199">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

present are signing feudal agreements will be affected by any future legislation—or if they will be. Will they have to buy their way out of it, or what precisely is to happen?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The principle of restrospection, in this case, has already been accepted by the House in the first step that we took. We gave to the proprietors being obstructed the right to go to the Lands Tribunal, and we gave to the Lands Tribunal the right to decide whether it should vary or annul land conditions which it found to be unreasonable, obstructive or out-of-date. Thus, the principle of retrospection in this matter has already been accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Secretary of State for his intervention. It could well be that that same principle will move on into the next piece of legislation. The Lord Advocate may be able to say something more about that later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude by repeating my welcome for the Bill, my hope that it will go speedily through the House before anything else happens, and the further hope that further legislation will follow quickly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Small</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make a few comments on the contradictions and historical aspects of the Bill. The hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Johnston) should not attack the Theodosios of Cathcart.The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor) is lucky to be with us. He is an understanding man. The day he went to sign to become a candidate, he signed himself "Teddy". "Teddy" is the shorthand, diminutive form of Theodosios of Cathcart, so he should have quoted his ancestors and he would have got by. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman was speaking as a misotheist, that is a man who hates the gods.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Was Theodosios a good or a bad man?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

the gods. I do not know how much my colleagues understand the classics, Plato, Socrates, Cicero, Homer, and so on, but this is material that I read. I also read the Italian classics and everything that comes within my reach and so, historically, I have yet to look at the aspects of received ideas. What the hon. Gentleman is really arguing with are received ideas from the past. I have a wee book here to which I shall refer in a minute or two.

The Secretary of State is a son of Solomon. He is the wisest man in the Committee, with all due respect to Lord Wylie. Lord Wylie indicated that the Secretary of State ought to have been a lawyer, and he would have been a better lawyer than Lord Wylie. Having lost Lord Wylie, the Tory Party is deprived of any certainty of reason, because he was the only man on that side for whom I, personally, in terms of Acts of Parliament and the law, had any great respect.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Small</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall deal with the terms "land tenure" and "human destiny" enshrined in terms of history. Some of my hon. colleagues understand it. At the time of William and Mary, the Puritans in England believed in the terms of the gods and in the divine right of kings. The Puritans as a movement have disappeared from the face of this planet. We come to the disenfranchisement in terms of William and Mary. Anyone who was a Jacobist did not acquiesce to their rule. They were disenfranchised in terms of land tenure. I am dealing with land tenure in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to the content of the Bill itself. It is a difficult Bill to follow, and I shall tell the Committee why. It fails in some ways to bring us up to the twentieth century. I shall start at the beginning of the interpretation and deal with what it does not do and does not say. It does not inform us what blench holding and blench
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0200">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
duties are. I take it that hon. Members have done their homework and understand what blench duties are. They are duties which must be paid in silver.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill introduces capital money. Capital money, whether inflated, deflated or otherwise, has a standing criterion in terms of value. I do not know how many people have read Horace's and Courtenay's poems. Horace says in terms of capital money:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I have completed a monument more lasting than brass"</p></blockquote>
That is capital money. Whether capital money will last longer than brass, I would not know, under any Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to one aspect of the Bill that titillates the mind. Clause 15 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"No action of declarator of irritancy for nonpayment of feuduty shall be raised by a superior after the commencement of this Act".</p></blockquote>
What is referred to here is the limitation of the right of irritancy for non-payment of feuduty under section 240 of the Feu-Duty Act 1597. I did my research, and I cannot find the original clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So we are not to be titillated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Small</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have here the Scottish Acts of Parliament 1424 to 1621. I shall not castigate the author for the omission, nor shall I weary the Committee with the language of 1597. I believe that 1894 was the year for the Interpretation Act of old Statutes. This will not apply. What puzzles me is the retention of Scots law 1597 "quhat". My arithmetic and spelling are terrible. When I read this I see that "quhat" means "what". I do not intend to read all the old Scots in it; I am merely giving an example. For greater accuracy we might have had the whole clause in Scots, rather than update it into this language which will create difficulties for the legal profession if it has to enact any part of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am subject to correction, being a member of the untutored proletariat and a very innocent man in society, but Clause 15 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"…in the Feu-duty Act 1597, for the reference to two years there shall be substituted a reference to five years."</p></blockquote>
I find this extremely puzzling, as we have not got a copy of the original. I have Sections, 238 to 241 in my hand, but Section 242 is missing.

This is where we are concerned with belief in the gods and the authorities of the past. This was in the days when it was the divine right of kings to give graces and favours to those who supported them. In these terms it is a 	<i>maximum novator tempis</i>—a time for the redress of defects. I should like that defect to be examined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to detain the Committee, but in another place the Minister of State referred to Her Majesty the Queen and to the Prince of Wales as Prince and Steward of Scotland. That was the recommendation in the other place. Here there is an omission; there is a reference to the Prince and Steward of Scotland; the words "of Wales" are missing.

I do not know how many people have studied Machiavelli's "Prince." Machiavelli was a public servant whose job was to advise the princes of Italy. If Machiavelli were alive today and he read this stuff and was adviser to the prince, here is a question of fidelity for my hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland: fidelity to the prince's interest or fidelity to the Commons' interest? There is here a great dilemma for whoever is the Secretary of State for Scotland. The Secretary of State for Scotland is nonparty in terms of the prince; he represents the public. Being a Scot he will remain a Scot and look after the interests of Scotland. I hope he will be successful in promoting further legislation to eliminate any deficiencies in the Act in terms of land tenure in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It occurs to me that the Committee might well be re-entitled the Conservative Legislation Reintroduction Committee, because this is what we seem to be doing.

Most people in Scotland will welcome this as a faltering step. It seems that in relation to housing and land reform, faltering steps are unfortunately the only things which we seem to have to welcome. I think that most people in Scotland, when they talk about feuduties going, really mean their being abolished and people not having to pay any more. What they will do here is pay quite a lot for the privilege.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one adopts the rather complicated formula which is suggested, of 2½ per cent.

	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
consols—something which does not usually form part of the general vocabulary in Scotland—the land superior may end up by getting more money than he would normally have got on the free market. If he were perhaps in the unfortunate position of having feuditues over an old tenement flat or an old tenement, he would be lucky in these days to get rid of them. He would be able to get rid of them only to someone who wanted to buy them to set off against losses on property in other spheres of taxation, where he might be able to reclaim tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He might fail to acquire these feuduties if he could find somebody to buy them and get rid of them on two to three years' purchase; they are as low as that. They are almost worthless in the general market because if the house is to come down shortly, the superior's interest is fairly minimal. If he wanted to irritate the feuer in order to get back the land he would probably be faced with certain costs of demolition, so it is not worth his doing that either.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may well be that the local authority will end up by paying more under the system which has been suggested by the Government than they would at present, where the actual compensation is based upon the value of the feudal burden—in other words, in relation to the property. It might be worth while for the district valuer, in relation to compensation matters for feuduties, to be allowed to assess the actual value rather than follow the somewhat arbitrary formula which is suggested in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principal interest of people in Scotland at present is to try to get a much simpler form of land tenure. There are two objections to the feudal system. The first is the terminology. Nobody in the 20th century wants to feel that he is living under the remnants of a feudal society. There is strong repugnance among people to paying feuduty simply because it is called feuduty, and simply to have land held because it is feudally held. The second objection is that although there was a logic in the system of landholding in Scotland developed over the years, it is a logic that has run mad in recent years with the fragmentation of house sales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was all very well when one disposed of land in large units. There was a certain logic in the form of land tenure. But now, when houses are split into large numbers of flats and where plots of land are divided
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
into eight or 12 houses per acre or for flats or in certain other ways, the feudal system has long outlived its day. It is expensive to operate and it is complicated. Those in the legal profession who deal with conveyancing would welcome a reduction in the amount of unnecessary work which they have because of the old-fashioned and outdated nature of landholding in Scotland. That might lead to a cheapening in the service offered, because the work would be less. Therefore, all sections of the community would benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why many people in Scotland are eager now to see what sort of simplification of the landholding system will be produced. It is not an easy matter. Anyone who has seen the reports which have been produced over the years will realise that this is a major reshaping of landholding, and one that is not easily introduced. Nevertheless, from the speeches which have been heard on both sides of the Committee today, I think that there is a demand for action. We can only commend it to the Lord Advocate in the dying days, perhaps, of this Parliament, that he should consider something further, even during the passage of the Bill. There are certain useful things which could be done to the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am very pleased to note the provisions which have been introduced in the Bill for the restriction of leases on domestic property. Many people willl accept, again ignoring the objectionable nature of the feudal society, that the 99-year lease is even more repugnant, because it means that at the end of the period of the lease the capital asset—a house built on top of the ground—would pass to the owner of the lease. There are certain places in England and Wales—in Cardiff in particular—where considerable distress was caused when leases began to reach the end of their life and people who wanted to retain their houses had to renegotiate at great expense to themselves. So this is a worthwhile restriction. If one blocks this form of landholding and the paying of feuduties, there is always a natural tendency to go round the back, and this is one way of closing the back gate. It may not be the only way. With the ingenuity of lawyers and accountants, it is sometimes difficult to keep pace with the legislators.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0202">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
objection to 99-year leases was that at the end of the 99 years the tenant would have to negotiate at his own expense? If so, will it not be the same with 20-year leases? In fact, will he not have to negotiate more frequently at greater cost?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I do not agree. The implications of this provision will be sufficient to discourage building leases of that type. A person entering into a 99-year lease would say "This will come to an end well beyond my lifetime; I am happy with the present situation". But people buying 20 or 30 years before the lease runs out may well find themselves in difficulty. If my hon. Friend has any arguments to offer to the contrary, naturally one would be willing to listen to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also suggest that the Bill could be improved by a clause dealing with preemption. The superiors' old rights to redeem. a property were abolished many years ago, but there still is a right of pre-emption in some areas which superiors exercise, so that if a house is sold to a third party he has the right within a certain time to buy back the house at a given value. This can not only cause delay in the buying and selling procedures, to the embarrassment of both the purchaser and the seller, but includes an unnecessary restriction on the rights of the citizen. I hope that the Lord Advocate will consider introducing a clause to deal with this vexed problem of pre-emption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, I hope that the Bill passes through this Parliament as swiftly as possible, even with other cosmetic alterations that may be made to it in Standing Committee. It is essential that we see the end of feuduties as they are, but it is only a faltering step, as has been indicated by others besides myself, and the sooner we have a wholesale alteration of the law of Scotland on the holding of land the better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I first apologise for the manner in which I have had to join and leave the Committee at intervals this morning, but I am serving, like the hon.

	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
I had the misfortune to have to leave in the middle of the speech of the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith). He indicated that the Bill, with one minor and one major difference, was identical to the last Conservative Government's Bill. I thought then that, for a farmer, the hon. Member was rapidly beginning to speak like a lawyer. For anyone to suggest that a Bill, with one minor and one major difference, is identical to another, seems to be playing with words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson) seems to have treated the Bill in a rather frivolous way. This is not a frivolous measure, but one for which the people of Scotland have long waited. However faltering the steps may be, they are certainly not decorated with cosmetics or to be treated lightly. I do not accept that it does the cause of the Scottish Grand Committee any good to treat these matters in such a frivolous and lighthearted manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I pass to the main burden of my comments, I want to deal with preemption. There is another element to be taken into account on this question of pre-emption, in as much as once a precedent is created, it would apply right through the question of selling houses and the pre-emption clause. The hon. Member knows full well that those local authorities who unfortunately, and certainly against my political beliefs, sell the local authority houses to their tenants—that may be the policy of the Scottish National Party; I have not found out yet —have a pre-emption clause, and that is the only part of the sale of council houses with which I agree. If those local authorities are to sell their houses to their tenants, it is right that they should insert a pre-emption clause saying that if the house is resold within a given period, the local authority should have first right to buy that house back at a given price which they recommend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to the burden of my remarks. I am sorry that the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Johnston) is not here, because he was on a good point about the relationship between the vassal and the superior. This is a problem that is giving cause for serious concern and will, in my view, act as a deterrent to those vassals who want to buy their feus. It would appear from a recent edition of the Scots 	<i>Law Times</i> and from expressions
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0203">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
of opinion by lawyers in Scotland that they will not be induced to encourage their clients to buy out their feus against the background of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Conservative Government's Bill contained a provision for a nominal feu of one penny. This was to preserve the relationship between the vassal and the superior—in other words, the condition that the superior could at any time impose land conditions on that piece of land even though the feu had been sold. The Bill still preserves that relationship. Clause I makes it clear that it has been preserved, although the nominal feuduty of one penny has been abolished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that when my right hon. and learned Friend winds up the debate he will say something on this important and worrying point. I do not think we have had the assurance that the hon. Member for Inverness sought. He seemed to be satisfied with it, but had I asked the question I should not have been satisfied. I hope that my right hon. and learned Friend will say something about this condition that has been retained whereby a person can buy out his feu but still at some later date have conditions applied to that land by the superior merely because the superiority has been retained. We must get this cleared up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, as my right hon Friend the Secretary of State said, recourse through the Conveyancing and Feudal Reform (Scotland) Act 1970 to the Lands Tribunal, whereby those who feel aggrieved by the circumstances I have just mentioned can ask for a relaxation of those conditions on the land on which they have just bought the feu. But the Bill ought to abolish the need for those people to go to the Lands Tribunal and seek relaxation. It grieves me that we have not dealt with it in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the difficulties that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and my right hon. and learned Friend the Lord Advocate have had in getting this legislation through in the parliamentary timetable within which we are working at present. Nothing that I have said should detract from the fact that we are taking not a small step but a major step forward in the reform of the feudal system in Scotland. No-one should doubt that. But it is right and proper that, in a debate of this kind, the doubts of hon. Members on both sides of the Committee should be expressed to
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
my right hon. and learned Friend the Lord Advocate in order, first, that he can give a reassurance, and, secondly, and probably more importantly, that he can give an indication of the future type of legislation that we shall have in order to remove the anomalies that I have described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem could be dealt with quite easily. There is a provision within the planning Acts and within the powers of local authorities that if someone seeks to do something that will damage his neighbours' interests, such as planting trees or erecting a 20 ft. fence, they can have recourse to the local authority to try to settle the matter. It seems to me unnecessary to retain this feudal relationship, while abolishing the feus. Why was it necessary, and why did the Government consider it necessary, to retain the feudal relationship, while at the same time abolishing the feus? The abolition of the feus has been widely welcomed—no-one should doubt that—but it is not conducive to the successful implementation and working of the Bill to retain this feudal relationship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have already indicated, there is disquiet not only in the legal profession—I do not speak on its behalf because, when I look round the Committee I see that it has able spokesmen of its own—but among those of my constituents who have expressed doubt about whether they will buy out the feu because of the fear that, at some later date, the superior, or those that own the superiority, will impose land conditions on them. The hon. Member for Inverness made a most important point, and I do not think he received the assurance and the type of answer to which his question entitled him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If my right hon. and learned Friend can clear up this matter first, by giving a reassurance, and, secondly, by giving an indication of the future type of legislation that we shall get to deal with this problem, he will do a double service to the people of Scotland. The first is by introducing the Bill, which we all hope will become an Act in the not-too-distant future, and the second is by giving us the assurance and the indication that I have asked for today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

rally, than to find anyone who would defend the system of feuduties. It is clear that all political parties, at least over the last five years, have been anxious to reform the existing system and I, like other hon. Members of the Opposition, welcome the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clearly invidious that, in the 1970s ordinary householders should continue to be required to pay a sum either to an individual they do not know, or to a corporation or organisation which has no corresponding obligation to them. I declare an interest in this respect, being a vassal of no less a body than Edinburgh Corporation. The only other interest that Edinburgh Corporation shows in my property, apart from demanding feuduty, is to demand rates from me once a year. Clearly, what we are talking about is not simply individual superiors, but corporate bodies, and the system is much more extensive than many people might otherwise suggest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much of the objection to the feudal system, lies not in the actual money which passes hands once a year, but in the terminology that is used. We have already heard reference to the indignity of persons being referred to as vassals of superiors, or the very existence of a feudal system in Scotland today. I am surprised that we do not have more resolutions from Scottish Labour Party conferences on the subject. I can already see the newspaper headlines, "Empty vassals make the most noise!"</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Members have enquired, why we do not have before us a Bill that will abolish the feudal system? It is curious that we do not have such a Bill bearing in mind the remarks by the then hon. and Learned Member for Edinburgh, Leith (Mr. Murray) in the last debate on this question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that there was a White Paper produced by the previous Labour Government entitled "Land Tenure in Scotland." It was referred to by the present Lord Advocate in the debate in this Committee in November last year. On page 11, paragraph 25(1), it states:
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"On an appointed day feudal tenure will be abolished."</p></blockquote>
That is an interesting commitment, because it clearly implies that the Labour Government at that time thought that such a measure was possible. During the debate in November of last year, the present Lord Advocate, referring to that document, asked the then Government:—
	<br><blockquote><p>"Why have these proposals not been put into the Bill before us?".</p></blockquote>
This is very important, because he was a very fair man at the time, and he pointed out that the paper in question was not simply a basis for discussion between all the various interested parties. The Lord advocate went on to say that this document:
	<br><blockquote><p>"was not a Green Paper; it was a plan for Government action."</p></blockquote>
In other words it was a specific commitment to introduce their measure which would abolish land tenure on a particular day.

The Lord Advocate may tell us in his reply that the important thing at this stage is to get the measure through; that to produce a Bill that would abolish land tenure on a fixed date would take a great deal of time to prepare. That may be his point of view, and if that is what the right hon. and learned gentleman is going to say, I would refer him to something else that he said in November of last year:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It could have been done at the beginning of this Government's term of office if they had been serious about the issue."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Scottish Grand Committee</i>; 20th November, 1973, cc. 12–14.]</p></blockquote>
If it could have been done at the beginning of the previous Government's term of office, presumably, if the right hon. and Learned Gentleman is serious about the issue, it could have been done at the beginning of this Government's term of office. I should be interested to hear why that has not proved possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As has been indicated, there are only two differences between the present Bill and that introduced by the Conservative Government, and I should like to comment briefly on both of these. First, a change has been made whereby, instead of the nominal 1p feu duty, no feu duty will be damandable by the superior of a vassal. That clearly will not make the slightest difference to the ordinary member of the public. We all know that no superior would demand that 1p, and even if he did it would have been a meaningless gesture. In this respect, this change is not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0205">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
deserving of the reference by the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson), to a purely cosmetic change which will neither remove injustice nor improve the workings of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other difference is more substantial, and that is the introduction of a clause requiring the compulsory redemption of the feu when the property is sold for the first time after the passing of the Bill. This is more important because, although in many respects it is a good idea, there are two points to which I would refer in relation to it. First, it will now be abundantly clear to all hon. Members that unless the Government bring forward subsequent legislation not only shall we have the feudal system with us for many generations to come, but we shall have the requirement of some vassals to pay feuduty to some superiors for many years to come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that a large proportion of properties in Scotland change hands only once in a generation. Many properties are owned by persons who bought them 50 years ago. There is reason to believe that many existing properties would not have their feus redeemed for a long period of time, so I think that the Lord Advocate and the Government will have to concede that we are not by this change ensuring the abolition of any payment of money by a vassal in the immediate future or even in the next ten or 15 years. We are talking about a very long-term change indeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point is that one of the immediate effects of the clause requiring the compulsory redemption of feuduty will be to increase the cost of buying a house. There is not the slightest doubt about this because, if the seller, on selling the house, has to redeem it to the superior, he will include the price that he will have to pay in the price that he will demand from the buyer of his house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard the Secretary of State's estimate that at the present time the amount that has to be paid to redeem a feu is approximately six and a half times the feuduty. I know that on my own house the feuduty that I have to pay is somewhere in the region of £8 a year, and I have a relatively small feu compared with some others. It will mean an extra cost to the purchaser of at least £50. For those houses which have a much higher feuduty the sum included in the buying price could be a substantial amount.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
The Government should seriously consider whether this is as much of an improvement on the Bill as they suggest. No one doubts that there must be voluntary redemption at any time, provided that the vassal, if he wishes to, can redeem the property from the superior. Whether we should insist on it being a compulsory measure by a certain date knowing that at a time of inflating house prices this will put an extra burden on the buyer of a house, places a serious doubt on any virtue or value which this measure might have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is pursuing an interesting and important point. Is he suggesting that it is not in the buyer's interest to buy out the feu against the background of the formula included in the Bill? Does the hon. Gentleman not agree that, if we could get the land relationship right between the vassal and the superiors, and if we could get the removal of the condition whereby at any given time the superiors could apply land conditions on the purchaser, it would be in the purchaser's interests to have to buy that feu out at the time of his buying the house in order that he would not be restricted—notwithstanding the local authority procedures on that—in what he wanted to do with what is, after all, his own property?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. To answer his second point first, it will not be possible, and never has been possible, for a superior to introduce new conditions in the feudal relationship at any subsequent time. All that he can do is insist on the original conditions being continued despite the change in ownership, so that point is not valid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards the first point made by the hon. Gentleman, clearly it is in the interests of the buyer of a property that the seller has to redeem the feuduty and that the feuduty does not continue, if the cost of doing so is not being transferred to the buyer when he purchases the house. The alternatives before us are whether the buyer would prefer to pay an extra £100, or more, as a lump sum at the time of purchasing the house, or to continue paying an annual, relatively small amount over the period of time that he owns the house. It is similar to asking whether someone might prefer to buy anything with a lump sum payment or by hire purchase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0206">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
The new clause in the Bill will insist that, instead of a regular payment of a relatively small amount there will be a lump sum payment, and whether the buyer likes it or not, unless the seller is an unusually generous person he will inevitably add the cost of redemption to the price that he is asking for the house, so that the price that he receives will not be diminished by the amount that he has to pay to the superior.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The practical effect will inevitably be an increase in the cost of housing to the purchaser of all but brand-new homes in Scotland, and it is incumbent upon the Lord Advocate to comment on whether the Government appreciate that and, if they do, why they believe that it is justifiable. Nevertheless, we welcome the Bill, and all Members will be anxious to see it carried on to the statute book before the next dissolution, whenever that might be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.6 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Henderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I begin what I hope will be a brief speech I ought to declare an interest. I pay a feu on my house. When I bought the house I offered to redeem the feu, but the offer was not accepted. Happily, when I move house to a more central part of the constituency shortly, I shall not be paying a feu at all and at that point my interest will cease.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like other members of the Committee I, too, am grateful for the Bill, particularly so because, at the time of the 1970 General Election, I made a positive commitment to my electorate that, if there were not Government legislation on this matter, I should seek to introduce a Private Member's Bill to prevent new feus from being created. By bringing forward the Bill, the Government have saved me a great deal of effort and time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is, however, astonishing that this important measure was not included in the outline of the Government's programme in the Gracious Speech. Could it be that the Government did not want to give credit to the previous Government for the work that they had done on this measure, or could it be that the Government did not, and perhaps still do not, like the measure but they have no other Scottish legislation to bring forward? Whatever the reasons, the Bill is welcome, and
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
I hope that there will be no accidents before it reaches the statute book. Perhaps the Lord Advocate can give an assurance that the work that will be done in Committee will not all be lost if there is an election before the Royal Assent is given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On private planning permission, which was referred to by the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) and by my hon. Friend the Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith), I find myself falling slightly between the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth and the two Front Benches. It is clear that there are merits in private planning provision. I am not at all sure that where there are such merits they are necessarily achieved by a continuation of the feudal system method whereby these planning arrangements are achieved. Perhaps the Government should give consideration at a later stage to bringing in legislation of a new character to give a new dimension to private planning practices under which many more people than merely feudal superiors can be involved in private planning and at the same time abolish the whole feudal system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put down a Written Question to the Chancellor of the Exchequer the other day but because of problems with the printing of HANSARD the reply may not have been published. I wanted to discover the basis of the calculation of the value for death duty purposes of the ownership of feus during the past decade. The answer that I have received is that the market value of a feu depends on such factors as the size and location of the property. The value therefore depends on the facts of the particular case. As you will recognise, Sir Myer, that is not a very helpful answer, except that one could amost read into it that the basis of the value for death duty purposes is market value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the Committee debates the detail of the Bill hon. Members ought to have a clearer view on this matter. otherwise injustice may be done. At the moment we do not know whether the basis in the past for death duty purposes has been on the basis of five years purchase or 25 years' purchase, or which part of the spectrum they come in. It would help the Committee if the Government could provide more detailed information on this point.

	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
Lastly, I come to Clause 3 which suggests a new charter of 	<i>novodamus</i>. Perhaps I am a little too radical for Members of the Government, but I think we ought to try to get more of our legislation into plain English, or in the vulgar tongue or even in Lallans. I do not know what a charter of 	<i>novodamus</i> means—fortunately it is defined in the Bill—but would it not have been easier to use some more understandable expression, one which comes more familiarly to mind? May I suggest to the Lord Advocate that it might be called a Wylie charter or a charter of Wylie, rather than a 	<i>novodamus</i>, with "Wylie" spelt as in previous Lord Advocate rather than "wily" as in present Secretary of State? As the nature of this charter is already defined in the Bill, I think it would come more freely to Members' minds, in recognition of the enormous amount of work done by the Lord Advocate's predecessor, to call this a Wylie charter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.12 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Douglas Henderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like the hon. Minister for Sterling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing), I must apologise for not having been here continuously this morning, but, like him, I have a commitment to another very important Committee. That is a Committee, in fact, on which there is not one Scottish Conservative, but of course, their experience of trade unions and labour relations is not exactly their strong point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think the first point I should make about this bill is that perhaps its title should have been better chosen. I find among constituents that there is some confusion about what this Bill is intended to do. I spoke to several constituents at the weekend who were under the impression that the whole feudal system would go, that all the feudal terminology, all the feudal relationships and restrictions would disappear with the passing of this Bill. I must say there was great disappointment when they found that the Bill had rather more limited objectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to bring to the attention of the Committee and especially the Lord Advocate, the situation in the north-east and other parts of Scotland where there is a form of tenure which is not covered at all by the Bill. Our constituents will be
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
cruelly disappointed that they have not been taken into account. I refer to what is known as tenancies at will. It is certainly prevalent around the north-east, in Aberdeenshire, Morayshire, I think also in Banffshire and, I am told, in Galloway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This form of tenancy has lasted for several hundred years. It is a most interesting form of tenure because houses are bought and sold like motor cars or other movable objects. Over these years, although there is no absolute feudal security for the person who has a tenancy at will, the system has worked extremely well and it has been a very cheap method of transferring property from one to the other. Most of the superiors concerned appear to have shown a very proper and correct degree of understanding to the tenancies at will.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the problems have started to arise within the last few years. This is for one very good reason. Many of these houses do not have modern amenities; they do not have proper bathrooms, proper sanitation, proper larders and other facilities. But they cannot get improvement grants because they cannot produce a feudal title.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that they have had a tenancy within their family. I have seen cases where the tenancy at will has been within that family right back to the 17th century. But these people who have had continued and uninterrupted occupation of that property have been unable to obtain improvement grants. Consequently, within the last one to two years there has been great pressure to try and obtain feudal titles so that they could apply for improvement grants. In passing, may I say that some of those who have since obtained a feudal title have found that the period for obtaining it has disqualified them from payments of the higher rate of improvement grant to which they would have been entitled, had they not had this delay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One must acknowledge that in many cases feudal title has been granted without difficulty by the superiors, on payment of a share of the legal fees, and that alone. I think these cases are to be commended. However, not everyone has been lucky. We have had some reactionary and grasping feudal superiors, who seem determined to squeeze the last penny out of these tenants. In one case, the superior has been asking for the sum of £400 plus a share of the legal costs to grant a feudal title. In my language, that is blackmail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Douglas Henderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I take the correction. This is nothing short of blackmail. Here are people who have occupied these houses on this tenancy arrangement. They have paid for the houses but they are unable to get title; they are unable to get improvement grants, to put proper bathrooms in their houses. I am most disappointed that the Government have done nothing to help these people in this particular legislation. I understand that there are considerable technical difficulties in the way of doing it, but I appeal to the Government to think again. These people deserve a break, and I would have hoped that the Government would have tried to give them one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.18 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. J. Grimond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Committee will allow me to raise just one or two points, which I invariably have to do on Bills of this kind. May I remind the Committee and the Government that there is another form of land tenure in Scotland, and that is udal law. I should like an assurance from the Lord Advocate, who I know is sympathetic to udallers, that nothing in the Bill will affect their rights. There may be amendments in Committee, but I should like a general assurance that he has taken into account the rights of udallers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further, there is in my constituency a curious and ancient impost called skat, which we have been trying to abolish for many years. Again, I ask the Lord Advocate whether those who pay skat can look forward, under this Bill, to any opportunity of seeing it either abolished or redeemed. I shall not pursue these points now, because they may be essentially Committee points, but I hope they are being borne in mind by the Government and that we shall have some mention of them in the wind-up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.19 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Teddy Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a very interesting debate indeed, particularly as we heard in the previous debate on 20th November all the intracacies of skat, the udals, and also the hon. Member for
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. Henderson) mentioning, as did his predecessor, Mr. Gordon, the question of tenancy at will. I must say I am bitterly disappointed that we have not heard about mulctures today, because I think it is only fair to say, in the presence of some of our friends from South of the Border, that there is this fourth one which has not been mentioned at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I think that this has been a very constructive debate, in which the Opposition have put forward constructive suggestions and criticisms. I thought there was a danger point when the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Small), in a very inflammatory speech, suggested that this Bill had the support of the Greek colonels, and had been originated by King William of Orange.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that what helped a great deal was the presence on this side of the Committee of two shadow Lord Advocates, one of whom, from Edinburgh, made an extremely good speech. The one point which I hope the Committee and particularly the Secretary of State himself will bear in mind is that if we compare our debate today with the discussion we had on 20th November, I think that all fair-minded people both in and outside the House will realise what a totally irresponsible, dreadful and destructive Oppositon we had in November, by comparison with the very constructive contribution which the Opposition has made today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State introduced this as a useful step forward in legislation. When we brought in a Bill which was in almost all respects identical, in November, we had the most appalling, savage attack perpetuated by the right hon. and learned Gentleman the Lord Advocate, who referred to the Bill not only, as my hon. Friend said, as a mouse, but as a mini-mouse, as being also a fraudulent measure—which appears pretty strong—and he also referred to it as "wretched." These are all recorded in the OFFICIAL REPORT of 20th November 1973.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman who is now a Minister with, I think, the Department of Industry, and who represents Caithness and Sutherland (Mr. Maclennan), said the most fantastic things about the Bill. He said it would not enable licensed premises to he provided on a pier in Lochinver. So far as I can see, we shall still not be able to have a licensed restaurant on the pier in Lochinver because the right hon.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0209">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
Gentleman the Secretary of State has brought in a bill which, in all its meaningful aspects, is quite similar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Bearing in mind what was said at the time on the need for a more important Bill, a greater measure of fundamental reform, the real comment in that last debate was made by the hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland, who said that nothing is more calculated to inject cynicism into politics and bring politics into disrepute than to raise expectations in opposition that one can and will do in government what one knows is difficult and may take many years of legislative working time. These are remarks made not by me or any of my hon. Friends, but by the hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland, who is now presumably discussing some extension of public ownership with the Secretary of State for Industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important that the hon. Member, who normally has his facts right, should understand that the hon. Member to whom he has referred is in the Dept. of Prices and Consumer Protection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I am well aware and that the hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland is involved in prices and consumer affairs, but my understanding was that in the extension of public ownership, particularly in relation to Scotland, he was very much involved. I am afraid that one of the unfortunate facts of today's so called open government is that back benchers are not told the facts. The hon. Gentleman should make a point of appreciating what is going on in his own Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had the Lord Advocate at that time saying that the Labour Party had a seven-point plan, which was to be speedily and fundamentally implemented, and that on an appointed day, as my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind) said, feudal tenure would be abolished. What worries me is the bitter disappointment which many people in Scotland feel, that after more than 100 days of what should have been dramatic action by the Secretary of State, all that has been produced in so-called new ideas are two Bills, both of which were in fact introduced by the last Government. We have our splendid Housing Bill,
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
which we have debated in Standing Committee, and now we have this feuduties measure, both introduced by the last Government. It is disturbing, bearing in mind the Queen's Speech, which promised us 100 days of dynamic action, that instead, all we have had from the Secretary of State has been the introduction of two old Tory Bills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to know what he and his colleagues in the Scottish Office have been doing. I hope they will re-read the Queen's Speech, which says, for example:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Urgent measures will be taken to reverse the…".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am afraid the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor) is going beyond the measure. Where we are dealing with a question of land tenure, it is fair enough for hon. Gentlemen to make their criticism; but I do not see that how it is in order to consider what else the Scottish Office is doing at present. It has nothing to do with the Bill under discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has not, but I think it is fair for me to register my severe disappointment and that of many supporters of the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What about the Bill in detail? I have mentioned that it is broadly the same Bill, but there are, as the Secretary of State has said, two differences. One is that we are abolishing the penny contribution, although it was not asked for, as my hon. Friend rightly said. It may be considered a contribution to the reduction of inflation, by removing the penny payment which will not be asked for, but I suggest that in practice it will make no difference whatever except that someone will not be able to ask for a penny, who would not in fact have been doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second thing is to insist that, on the change of ownership of a house, the feu will be extinguished by a payment. This, as my hon. Friend has also said, will simply put up the price of houses by a comparable amount. But we shall want to ask some detailed questions of the Government in Committee. I shall put some of them to the Minister now in the hope that he can give us a broad answer to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first point is one which I raised on the last Bill. Why do we base compensation on 2½ per cent. consols? The
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0210">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
interesting fact about feuduties is that they are paid gross to the fuedal superior, not net of tax. The only Government stock of which I am aware which makes its interest payments gross is 3½ per cent. War Loan. On that one gets one's interest gross and has to pay back the tax, is if one is liable, or not, if one is not liable. If, on the other hand, one has 2½ per cent, consols the tax is deducted from the interest at source, and if one is not liable for tax one has to reclaim it, and sometimes this can take a long time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As feus are a gross payment made to the superiors or their agents, the appropriate Government stock for comparison should be that one Government stock which pays out the interest gross, and not net after deduction of tax. Could the Lord Advocate tell me why not 3½ per cent. War Loan, and would this make any great difference?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second question relates to Clause 6 which deals with compulsory purchase orders on property and the extinguishing in a different way by the person who is initiating the compulsory purchase order. I wish to ask the Lord Advocate about the voluntary sale of houses to a local authority when the local authority is making a major development. There are few examples these days of compulsory purchase. Most such sales are negotiated between the owner and the local authority before the actual development takes place or the new road is built. The compensation we pay to people in these circumstances is laid down in legislation, and only the other day in Standing Committee we were talking about the way in which we would negotiate compensation for people who were considered for compensation under the housing action area procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would the Lord Advocate say whether changes will be made in the Bill, or whether administrative arrangements can be made, to compensate people who are selling their houses voluntarily to the local authority, for the extinguishing of a feu in these circumstances? With a compulsory purchase order, the local authority will take over responsibility for the feuduty. But if it is a voluntary sale, the obligation will still be on the original owner of the house. Will the extinguishing of the feu be taken into account when we are considering compensation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third thing is about the procedure for redemption. We know that once
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
the Bill becomes law—and I am glad that everyone will co-operate in doing this speedily—twice a year people will have the right to buy out their feu if they so desire. I wonder whether many people will bother, because here is a situation where we make a capital payment instead of continuing to make an annual payment, and at a time when interest rates are high and look likely to rise, some people may consider that, with the severe reduction in the value of money, buying out a feu is not a good buy. If we are told that we can buy out the feu for 6½ times the purchase price, we must remember that with inflation at its present rate under this Government and before, £1 today will be worth l½p in less than 18 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this situation, what precisely is the point of buying out a feu now, to be relieved of making fixed payments over a long period of years? I put this point to the Lord Advocate, because the Committee will deceive itself if we think that a large number of people will rush out to buy out their feus; it will not necessarily be a great bargain for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because we want the Bill to work and feus to be redeemed, we should try to improve the administrative arrangements. As far as I can see from Schedule 1, if I want to buy out my feu I have to write something which looks like a legal notice, I have to get everything right and to state that, taking note in terms of Section 4 of the Land Tenure Reform (Scotland) Act, I wish to redeem at the term of Whitsuntide or Martinmas the the feuduty of so much per annum exigible in respect of the land in question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be more helpful if we said that, not every year but only on one occasion after the coming into operation of the Bill, feudal superiors should be under an obligation to make a straight offer to offer to all the people who are paying them feuduties. Could we not have the superior just once, after the Bill becomes law, sending a formal notice to all the vassals saying that now the Bill has become law, if they sign the form and send him a certain sum of money they can extinguish their feus. I suggest that if we do not have something along those lines, very few people will bother to redeem their feus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My fourth point was put by some Members of the Committee in November —whether it is fair and reasonable that all feus should be based on the same principle
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0211">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
of compensation. Should it be 6½ years for a feu which might be £40 per annum or one which might be 25p per annum or bearing in mind that the market value of the lower feus is infinitely lower because of the administrative costs involved in collecting a small sum of money?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My fifth point is very important. I hope that the Government will make it clear very soon, and certainly before the Bill is enacted, their long-term plans to eliminate the feudal system. It is essential that the Government should do so, because this too will act as a disincentive to the vassals redeeming their feus. If one is told to buy one's feu now at 6½ years' purchase, or wait for a lucky bag of a Government plan to abolish feuduties eventually, I think most people might be inclined to wait. As I think the hon. Member for Duneee East (Mr. Wilson) said, many people in Scotland are under the impression that some feus are to disappear on a certain date, and they will not have to pay any more. It is important that the Government should make it clear that, even in the long term, there will be no question of feus just disappearing or payments just stopping; that if there is a long-term measure, it will involve the public paying a higher annual figure for a period of years so that the feu can be eliminated. Unless the Government do this, they will not have any great success in getting feus redeemed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Lord Advocate can answer some of these detailed points, but I give him the general assurance that we on this side of the Committee will cooperate manfully with him in getting the Bill through the Committee. On the other hand, there are certain important detailed points on which we shall be looking for reassurances in the Committee, but I can assure him that he will have our co-operation in trying to give the Bill a speedy passage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We consider this to be quite an important Bill. It is important along the lines of a major reform which will certainly be a difficult reform to introduce. It will obviously not do a great deal for the average householder, but it is a step in an important direction. I hope the Lord Advocate will reconsider the inflammatory, harsh and unjust words which he used in November when commenting on our Bill. I hope that on future occasions when we have, as we
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
expect speedily, the return of a Conservative Government, and bring in new advanced and proper measures of social reform, we will have from the Opposition of the day, which may be the Labour Party, the same co-operation and the same constructive message which I and my hon. Friends have advanced today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.34 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate (Mr. Ronald King Murray)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor) said some nice things before he ended with rather a sting in the tail of his speech. I would simply welcome the sense in which the Front Bench opposite have welcomed the measure. I am grateful to hon. Members of the Committee who have welcomed it also.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I go on to deal with the specific and cogent points raised by various hon. Members, I should make it clear that I will not bandy words and will not attempt to defend in detail various things that were said by different people at different times. It would be much more to the point to continue with constructive work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind) took me to task on the previous debates, because I mentioned the timetable that had been set out in the Labour Party's White Paper. I seemed to be saying that the previous Government did not take any step and the Labour Party in a short time would have introduced a Bill abolishing feuduties. If the hon. Gentleman reads HANSARD carefully he will see that what I was saying was that the Conservative Government had three and a half years during which they could have introduced some measure, and I thought that after that space of time the measure they introduced ought to have been a full-blown phase 3 Bill for abolishing the feudal system, instead of simply an interim phase 2 Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the same light, it may well be that I accused the then Government of a certain degree of fraud in the way in which they presented their Bill. If the hon. Gentleman and other hon. Members were to look at the newspapers at about that time they would see that the papers certainly took it that the Conservative Government were introducing a phase 3 Bill to abolish the feudal system entirely. Everyone agrees that they were not doing that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0212">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
I should perhaps pick up the lifebelt before I go on. I certainly indicated that the Bill which the Tories introduced was a mini-Bill, and that it was not enough. I remain of that view. It is a mini-Bill which we have picked up. We have improved it, and it is a little bigger than it was. It is better and more useful, and it has a sharper cutting edge. Obviously, the problem facing the Conservative Government at the time was that they had left themselves too little time even to introduce an interim measure, and the Bill went with the dissolution before the last General Election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour Government came in with a minority, and they have been in power for only a short time. I do not think that opposition Members will see this in a different light, if they consider it fairly. Surely the important thing for a Labour Government coming into office was to try to pick up this important, though not major, matter of reform—important phase 2, not phase 3 land tenure reform— and ensure that it could go on the statute book without any loss of time. Credit should be given to the Government for doing precisely that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members who were on the Committee of the previous Bill will recollect that the operative date of the Bill now before the Committee is the same as in the original Bill published by the Conservative Government. It is true that in Committee it was brought forward six months. It was lost by the dissolution. The net result is that we have managed by the expedition with which this Government have carried on their work since they came to power in these short few weeks to put before the House a Bill which I hope will go through rapidly. We have lost no time from the original Bill published by the Conservatives last year, and we are entitled to full credit for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I go on to deal with some of the specific and interesting points raised during the course of the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Henderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In his subsequent remarks will the right hon. and learned Gentleman deal with a further aspect of timing, which is concerned with when the next phase will be?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intended only to touch on the matter, because I was
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
trying to get rid of the previous high-flown language and come down to realities. I am merciful to hon. Gentlemen opposite, because they have used some phrases which could be quoted. It is important to get down to the details.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) accused the Bill of replacing one fiction by another—a feudal fiction by a legal fiction. That is an unfair criticism. In particular, that point does not do justice to the important but involved complication that retaining the one penny feuduty, if asked, implied. I touched on the matter in a previous debate. My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Doig) argued strongly in the Committee the fact that if one left a feuduty of any kind, even a nominal one, there was a risk that the feudal superior would irritate the feu and therefore take over the property entirely. It could happen in various situations which were figured in those debates. It was not a fanciful possibility, but a real danger, and the previous Government recognised that by an amendment which introduced a longer period during which the feuduty could be unpaid before the superior would have a right of irritancy. The fact that a considerable amendment was necessary to deal with that specific point shows how important it is to have swept this danger away altogether. That is what we have done in the first clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not fair to say, as the hon. Gentleman suggested, that the provision which we have introduced in Clause 1 is of the nature of a legal fiction. The original idea that a feudal superior had a right to enforce land conditions by virtue of the nexus created by the feuduty is more of a fiction than what we are left with here. We have got rid of the monetary payment and we have said that the connection between the superior and the vassal shall none the less remain so that the superior can enforce the land conditions which are there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It can therefore fairly be said that the connection is more direct than it was and that, as the hon. Gentleman recognised in his speech, nothing has been lost except the feuduty. I cannot see that it is more than bandying words to maintain that one is in that situation where one is cutting off something using Occam's razor to get rid of an unnecessary and odious payment. I think that it is bandying words to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0213">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
suggest that that is introducing a legal fiction. it is nothing of the sort.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect to the right hon. and learned Gentleman's argument, the clause says that a deed executed after the date which contains a grant of land shall have effect otherwise as if the grant were subject to a feuduty. That must be a legal fiction, because it asks us to pretend that feuduty is being paid even though it is not. This must be a fiction, and I think that the right hon. and learned Gentleman himself is bandying words.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us not bandy words any further about it. The fact of the matter is that one is cutting out an unnecessary, otiose payment and leaving the relationship substantially entire. The words used may have the ring of a legal fiction; the reality, which is what matters, is that we are cutting off something unnecessary and leaving the basic relationship entire. If the hon. Gentleman does not like that, he can suggest some better way of doing it, but it seems to me that that is the right thing to do, and that is what the Bill proposes to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point raised by the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns concerned the protection that the purchaser might have if the seller disappeared, for example, and could not be traced, and had not in fact paid the money to the superior in order fully to implement the redemption of the feuduty. There are two points there. First, there is a simple point arising out of the wording of Clause 5. The effect of the first subsection of the clause is that feuduty exigible at the date of redemption shall be deemed to have been redeemed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not make any apology for the technical language used, because it is accurate language and we are dealing with an archaic field of the law, so one must temper the language to the subject. In this situation, it is clear that, on the sale taking place, from then on no feuduty can be exacted the property. I am not sure whether this is the one the hon. Gentleman meant, but the obvious and straightforward protection will be that the purchaser gets the property free of the burden of feuduty. He certainly gets it without any continuing feuduty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second aspect, which perhaps again was one the hon. Gentleman had in mind, concerns what happens if the seller has
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
not paid the money to the superior and therefore there is a continuing obligation running with the land for this payment to be made to the superior. It is obvious that one has to have some method of protecting the superior's right to the money, and that is included in the clause, but the position will clearly now be that the seller remains liable to make that payment to the superior, and in future conveyancing practice will be that the purchaser will not hand over the purchase price without seeing a receipt for the redemption money. But if by any chance that breaks down, an obligation will still remain on the seller to pay the redemption money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although it may be that in the last resort the superior may have to recover it from the purchaser if nobody else can be found and all reasonable steps have been taken, yet the court, under Clause 5(7), will not order recovery from the purchaser unless it is satisfied that it is not practicable to recover it from the seller. So it is only a last resort, which would lead to the admitted protection which has to be put in the Bill to provide that the superior gets the payment of this sum, that this burden would fall upon the purchaser. He would clearly have the right to recover that money from the seller if the seller could be traced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the circumstances, I think that the Opposition may feel that the security for the purchaser is about the best security that could be provided without unfairness to the other parties who are necessarily involved in this complicated relationship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman raised matters about the general value of conditions running with land, and perhaps I could deal with that at a later stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also dealt with the timing of future legislation as far as the present Government is concerned. As to the timing, it is difficult in the present political situation, to set out any particular programme. The previous Labour Government set out a clear series of stages in the White Paper of 1969. Clearly, the intention would be to follow through the sequence of events that was there set forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Phase 1 of the Labour Party's programme of 1969 was the 1970 Conveyancing Act. Now we have phase 2, which is the Bill, for stopping feudalism providing for the redemption of existing feuduties. Phase 3 will be the major measure which will be required to reform land tenure
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0214">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>49</span>
entirely in Scotland and abolish the feudal system as we know it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that phase 3 must be associated, as the hon. Gentleman hinted, with legislation to introduce radical changes in registration of title. The work that is being carried on by the present Government is in parallel on these two lines. We are extremely anxious to press ahead as quickly as possible with phase 3, with the full reform of land tenure. At the same time, we are pressing forward with registration of title. It would be wrong for me to say that one could be done before the other. I think that it would probably be more logical to do registration of title first and then proceed to the major reform, but one cannot be dogmatic in these matters, and the present Government will be most anxious to press forward with all haste in both those regards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the present political situation, it would be quite absurd to put forward any sort of timetable. I attach the greatest importance and urgency to getting the phase 3 operation under way. I contemplate that that is a matter which I shall press strongly, and the Government are anxious to get it through with the maximum speed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Suppose there were no question of unsettled political conditions and that the right hon. and learned Gentleman could look forward to a settled period of Government. How long would it take to introduce phase 3?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an impossible task. The magnitude of it can be appreciated only when one starts to do the job and to get to grips with the problem. Perhaps I may refer the hon. Gentleman to what the Labour Government put in the White Paper of July 1969. The timetable is spelled out there perfectly reasonably, and the indications were that in 1969 the Labour Government were hoping to introduce a major measure at the end of 1971. That is the kind of timetable to which we would certainly want to stick.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, West raised the question of a multiplier. I think he indicated that he would prefer a fixed multiplier to a system of payment based upon Consols. The answer to that was given by another hon. Gentleman who pointed out that
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
in the present period of inflation one may get a better bargain through having a rather complex formula of this sort. A fixed multiplier might tend to be preferable if one were talking of feuduties extending for a long period ahead, because that would be a sort of long-term view in terms of which certainty of the kind which he was suggesting would be desirable. If one is hoping that the feudal system will be abolished rapidly—and the Bill goes some distance in that direction—my hon. Friend may feel that the question of the fixed multiplier is not such a strong argument as he may have believed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that connection, it may be useful to point out that the Bill may go a considerable distance towards abolishing feuduties. If one takes the average turnover of houses—not the period of 50 years mentioned by the hon. Member for Pentlands, but the average of five to seven years—it is clear that, apart from voluntary redemption of feuduties, in a comparatively short number of years—one would imagine under 10 years—about half the houses will have their feuduties removed by the mere operation of the compulsory redemption on sale. One cannot commit oneself to the actual arithmetic, but it must be something of that order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, there is the question of the voluntary redemption. Some hon. Gentlemen suggest that not much use will be made of this. I, on the contrary, suspect that it will be greatly used. At any rate, that is an additional bonus. If it is widely used—and we intend to give it the widest publicity to ensure that people are well aware of their rights—the end of feuduties will come about within a handful of years. By the time we come to the major Bill, which I hope will be in the very near future—phase 3—we shall find that a substantial proportion of feuduties have already been abolished.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. and learned Friend aware that when we transfer them in this way and someone sells his house he may himself still have to redeem his feuduty before he can sell? Therefore, it is much better for him to know that he can add, say, six times the net amount to the price of the house to recoup himself for it, rather than have an unknown formula. Even if that one stays, a seller would still not know. He might overcharge or undercharge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0215">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>51</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see that there are certain attractions about it, but perhaps my hon. Friend can leave the matter to further argument in the Committee. The case can be made very strongly that the present arrangement is as good as can be expected, and is fair and reasonable in the circumstances. I again urge upon my hon. Friend the point that the fixed multiplier does not look very attractive in the long term. It is a long-term project.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Time is running short, Sir Myer, and it is clear that I shall not be able to deal in detail with all the individual points which hon. Members raised, but I think that before I conclude I should deal with one major point that was raised by a number of hon. Members. Perhaps if I deal with that major point, those hon. Members whose questions I have not specifically answered today will forgive me for not doing so. I must try to deal with the points raised by the hon. Member for Cathcart at the end of his speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The general point that was raised by a number of hon. Members was in connection with the conditions of land tenure which now exist and which will continue to exist after the Bill has gone through. My hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) raised this point, as did the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Johnston) and other hon. Members. The hon. Member for Inverness, in particular, posed an anomaly that could arise. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State pointed out to him that under the 1970 Act an application to the Lands Tribunal could lead to the suspension of an unreasonable condition from a feu.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is one of the things that can be done, but it does not necessarily follow that that goes far enough. I think that this is what my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth was concerned about; that a feudal condition which is unreasonable will be got rid of by the Lands Tribunal, but that will be based upon rules of law, and it may he that many other onerous land conditions nevertheless would continue because they could not be said to be unreasonable in terms of the law as the Lands Tribunal has to interpret it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is in that field that there would be considerable anxiety—certainly on this side of the Committee—to ensure that the radical reform which takes place under
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
phase 3 gets rid of the unnecessary, and in many cases socially damaging land conditions which can be included. That is not to say that there is not a proper place, in a system of land tenure, for reasonable land conditions—I think that there is— but it is very important that we should have a radical measure of reform which will get rid of the unnecessary and the vexatious, and which will prevent an unnecessary clampdown and dampening of enterprise where, for example, a local authority wishes to do something and is at present faced by what it conceives to be an unreasonable land condition but one which, nevertheless, cannot be suspended by the Lands Tribunal. It is in that field that we can see reform taking place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also want to reserve the Government's position in regard to the point that was put forward by several opposition Members to the effect that one should have, as it were, two systems of planning running in parallel—public planning and private planning. I certainly should not want to associate myself with any idea of that kind, but in denying that I am not saying that there is not a perfectly proper place for reasonable land conditions. I think that it would be quite wrong for there to be a private method of controlling planning which is running in competition with local authority and public planning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Gourlay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a case in my constituency of an old gentleman who may have to have recourse to the land court and is unable, for financial reasons, to do so. Since the planning authority and the Dean of Guild court have already given approval for the necessary alterations, it seems farcical that we should abolish fees and at the same time leave these conditions whereby people in these circumstances can be thwarted by an individual.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I realise that there are anomalies of the kind that my hon. Friend has indicated. The important thing is to get on with phase 3, having got this Bill on the statute book. I think it is very important to get the Bill through. It is a greatly improved Bill, and I hope that the Committee will give it a Second Reading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not been able to answer the detailed points put by the hon. Member for Cathcart. There are two alternatives
