	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee have considered the draft Caribbean Development Bank (Additional Contributions) Order 1974—[	<i>Mr. Harper.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Overseas Development (Mr. William Price)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, may I apologise for the absence of my right hon. Friend, who is on her way back from ministerial business in Jamaica.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Caribbean Development Bank was established in January 197. The membership comprises the United Kingdom and Canada and all the Commonwealth countries of the Caribbean, including the Associated States and Dependencies. Venezuela became a member in April 1973, and Colombia is expected to joint in the near future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 1 of the bank's charter states that the purpose of the bank shall be to contribute to the harmonious economic growth and development of the member countries in the Caribbean and to promote economic co-operation and integration among them, having special and urgent regard to the needs of the less developed members of that region. As a founder member of the bank, the United Kingdom wholeheartedly supports these objectives, and believes that in the relatively short period of its existence the bank has established itself on sound lines as an institution with a great rôle to play in the development of the Caribbean.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In furtherance of its objectives, the bank undertakes two kinds of financing operations: ordinary operations financed from its share capital or from the proceeds of loans raised on the capital market, and special operations financed from Govern-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
ment contributions for the purpose of making loans on specially concessional terms to the less developed member countries. This order is concerned with the ordinary operations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The bank's programme for ordinary lending over the three-year period to 1977, which has our approval, calls for total lending of the order of 42 million United States dollars. As it has already committed itself to loans to the full extent of its existing paid-in capital, it must either increase that paid-in capital or borrow on the capital market, and it has decided to follow the latter course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the board of governors agreed in April 1973 that the bank's authority to borrow should be limited to the amount of the callable capital of its developed members only, that is, to that of the United Kingdom and Canada, whose callable capital amounts to $5 million each. This restriction of borrowing was adopted because it provides greater security to lending institutions and should result in these institutions offering more favourable terms than would otherwise be available. Its consequence is that of the total needed for the period to 1977 only the $10 million of callable capital subscribed by the United Kingdom and Canada is available, and the remainder must be found by an increase in the bank's total callable capital great enough to provide a little over $32 million from that subscribed by the United Kingdom and Canada.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That sounds a highly technical description. As I understand it, it means that the bank wishes to increase its callable capital to $120 million, which will allow it to borrow more money in the market. The capital will be $42 million, split between us and Canada. That is the position in simple terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As all member countries subscribe on a proportionate basis, the total amount to be subscribed in this way will be $92 million, of which roughtly $60 million will come from the developing members, but, for the reasons I have given, will not be available as backing for the bank's borrowing. These matters were considered in a preliminary way by the board of governors at a special meeting held last year, and specific recommendations were approved by the board at its annual meeting in May this year, with our support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0497">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
In exact terms—and adopting the 1969 value for the United States dollar—the recommendation was that the authorised capital stock of the bank be increased by $92 million, divided into 18,400 shares with a par value of $5,000 each, which shall be in the form of callable shares. The United Kingdom's subscription will be 3,477 shares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The additional subscription of callable shares does not mean that Her Majesty's Government are being asked to provide funds immediately or, it is hoped, in the future. But these shares are legally callable and we are, by this order, accepting a contingent liability to provide an amount of up to $17,385,000 if called upon to do so by the bank.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, therefore, the position is that we are not being asked to provide money; we are asked to provide callable capital to enable the bank, on the best possible terms, to raise money for development in the Caribbean. That is, I hope, a relatively simple explanation of what is a quite complicated affair. I hope that, with that explanation, the Committee will feel able to approve the draft.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.37 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Bernard Braine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee is grateful to the hon. Gentleman for explaining this somewhat technical matter so clearly. As we end the present Session of Parliament, it is good to find some- thing that we agree about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition warmly welcome the order. The bank is entitled to expect us, a founder member, to give continued support. In any event, I should expect us to support the policy of channelling development aid through regional banks. This seems to be an excellent way of ensuring that aid reaches recipient countries in a disciplined and self-regulatory way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has always seemed to me that the Caribbean Development Bank is in some ways more useful in relation to the region it serves than are the larger regional bands. As I understand it, the bank has a dual function, first, to help to promote development in individual territories in the Caribbean; and second, it has a longer term objective, though none the less important, to promote integration in a widely scattered area. In that sense, I
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
suppose, the bank is working in parallel with the Carifta.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suppose that the Caribbean is better known to Members of Parliament than is almost any other part of the Commonwealth, with constant exchanges and visits between this country and the Caribbean. Those who know it are well aware that it is an extremely widely scattered area. Communications are a basic problem, and, moreover, the economies of the various territories are not complementary; they are, in essence, competitive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Caribbean Development Bank had not existed, it would have had to be invented. It must be of enormous value, particularly to the smaller countries in the Caribbean, to have the expertise provided by the bank's staff in order to help them evaluate their development potential and to ensure that funds are properly used in really effective development. The bank has been singularly fortunate in the first Chairman, Sir Arthur Lewis. The present Chairman, I understand, is Mr. William Demas, and we have complete confidence in him. We on this side give our support to the order, and we hope that the effort this country is making, together with Canada, will help in the development of the region which historically has been so long associated with this country and with which so many Members of Parliament have a warm personal relationship.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.41 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Douglas Dodds-Parker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have two questions to put to the Minister. In 1965, at the invitation of Lord Greenwood, the Colonial Secretary—I think that he was the last Colonial Secretary—I went out to the West Indies following my membership of the Smaller Territories Committee which Arthur Creech Jones and Lord Attlee set up in about 1947. Since then, I have tried to take not just an academic and Parliamentary interest but a practical interest in what is being done to help these countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There were two in particular that Lord Greenwood asked me to look at, the Caymans and the Turks and Caicos, which were then not doing so well. I gather that the Caymans are now doing all right, but the Turks and Caicos still require considerable assistance and help is being
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0498">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
given by grant by Her Majesty's Government now. Are these islands—I assume that this is so—now able to ask for loans from the Caribbean Development Bank? Although they are not part of what is called the Caribbean, I assume that they are part of it for the purposes of the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Second, the figure is given as up to $17 million if required. Is there any parliamentary control over any detailed projects that the bank may put up? Is there any way for Ministers or Parliament to say that certain projects should take priority, or is this done through normal commercial channels?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.43 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the answer to the second point is that while we certainly have an advisory capacity wherever our money is being spent, the final decision would not rest with us. If that is not the position, I shall write and tell the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can perhaps better answer the hon. Gentleman's questions in two weeks' time. I go to the Caribbean on Monday to spend two weeks looking at developments and endeavouring to see what can be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
done. I shall write to the hon. Gentleman upon my return, and hope to be able to answer his questions much more fully than I can now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
