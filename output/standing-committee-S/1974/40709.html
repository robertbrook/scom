<p>10.31 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Ancram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall do my best, Sir Myer, not to require you to use your voice too much, by trying to keep in line during the course of the debate.<br><br>
It is with a sense of urgency that I have the honour to initiate the debate on agriculture today, not only because I realise that it is a short debate and I do not wish to detain the Committee for too long, but—more importantly—because it is a debate on a matter of growing national importance.<br><br>
May I begin by declaring my interest. I am a partner in a tenant farm in the Borders, and I would have hon. Members believe that this in itself allows me to speak with some experience about the actual day-to-day problems and the effects of Government policy on agriculture in Scotland generally.<br><br>
I know—and this fills me with some apprehension—and I was reinforced in this belief by comments made by certain Government Members in this Committee last week, that agriculture is a dirty word among certain hon. Gentlemen opposite, but rumour has it that some of them have been seen buying and eating food. Some of that food is Scottish produced. What
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 162</span>
we are talking about, and what it is time Government Members realised, is that a farmer is not a rich capitalist bogeyman, as is so often suggested, but is the producer of one of the most essential commodities that we consume in this country, and that is food.<br><br>
Of course there are rich farmers, but the vast majority of farmers in Scotland are working farmers, farmers with limited means, farmers with stretched finances, who are merely trying to produce the nation's food as economically as they can. If we intend to be realistic this morning, it is against this essentially mundane background that the debate should be conducted.<br><br>
We have had sufficient debates on agriculture in the House recently to know in advance what the Government's line will be. I hope that I am not being unfair in suggesting that that line follows two themes: first, the theme that has been taken by the Government over the past four months that all the present problems were the previous Government's fault; and, secondly, that the present Government have done enough now to satisfy the needs of the farmers. We would do well this morning, if we do nothing else, to examine the validity of those two theses.<br><br>
The Secretary of State for Scotland said forcefully in the debate the other night that the problem did not start on 1st March. I agree with him, and I shall give him another date concerning beef; namely, 23rd March when his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Agriculture came back from Brussels with a package which, as it turned out, contained nothing more than the torn-up hopes of Scottish beef producers.<br><br>
Of course problems existed before, as was shown in terms of a lowering market at the time of the election, but the farmers at that time were sustained by a knowledge that a price guarantee existed to catch them if the price fell too low. That confidence, so essential in every aspect of the farming industry, was totally eroded when the Secretary of State for Agriculture effectively announced that he had taken the bottom out of the beef market.<br><br>
He realised this too, I believe, because, in an attempt to shore up that confidence, he let it be known that he had taken what he called an option on intervention. But, in statement after statement thereafter, he let it be known that he had no intention of intervening. In indisputable terms he
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0310">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 163</span>
removed completely the guaranteed price from the beef producers of Scotland for the first time since 1948, yet hon. Gentlemen opposite expressed surprise that confidence in the beef part of the market had collapsed.<br><br>
This was not the end. At the same time, the right hon. Gentleman allowed the gap between the community's guide price and the United Kingdom guide price for beef not to decrease, as was the intention under the transitional arrangements, but to increase from £3.80 to £5.16. In effect, this quickly and cleanly undercut the home beef market, allowing, at no benefit to the British people£which was the prime concern£subsidised European beef to be imported at the expense of the British£ and, in our terms£the Scottish, farmer. It is little wonder that the farmers in my constituency sought urgent meetings with me to tell me that their livelihoods and the future of their beef production units were severly threatened.<br><br>
We have now had some response from the Government, and I shall deal with that in a minute. On the line taken by the Secretary of State for Scotland that it was the last administration's fault, I make two comments. First, farming is a long-term business, requiring both confidence and an act of faith. The present Government belied that faith and destroyed that confidence. Secondly, the hon. Gentleman and his Friends are the Government now, and they must realise that they must stop looking back into the past for excuses and accept their responsibilities to provide solutions to the problems which in large measure, they have created themselves.<br><br>
The food producers in my constituency rightly stress that they cannot produce food on excuses: they want answers and actions. We have been told that the right hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends have taken action£and so, in part, they have£ and I shall look, briefly and realistically where possible, at what they are doing.<br><br>
I return for a moment to the question of beef production. After intense pressure from the opposition in Committee and the threat of yet another Government defeat in the Chamber, the Government finally announced a certification scheme for fat cattle. The farmers of Scotland, like the Opposition, gave that announcement a qualified welcome, although we believe that it was to little and too late. Nevertheless, the welcome has been reflected in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 164</span>
a slight firming in the market. It was the sort of welcome that a drowning man gives to someone who throws him a rope, but it becomes meaningful only when the rope begins to pull him to safety. It is not enough if it merely prolongs the time before that man drowns.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will be able to give us some answers today.<br><br>
First, when will the scheme come into effect. We know that the machinery exists and that the industry cannot afford delays.<br><br>
Secondly, what will this scheme entail? We have heard that the return will not drop below £18 per live hundredweight, but this in itself is ambiguous because we do not know whether this will be the initial rate of the certification or whether it will be an average seasonal rate. If it is seasonal, then it is quite clear that the summer guarantee will be far too low to do any good at all. We and the farmers already regard £18 as being too low, and if it is allowed to drop below that during the summer months the scheme might as well not be there.<br><br>
Thirdly, what is the reason for the delay in announcing the specific details of the scheme? The farmers of Scotland require these details now, even before the scheme goes into operation, so that they may start budgeting and working out their plans for the future.<br><br>
I hope that this information can be made available today, together with one other and, perhaps more important, answer which the farmers of Scotland require from the Government. Why was it not until the end of June and the collapse of confidence in the industry that action was taken at all? Why could this action not have been taken when the crisis became apparent three months ago? For this, and this in particular, no one but the present Government can take the blame. We know that over the last three months the Secretary of State has rested on the so-called laurels of the calf subsidy, but this is only just beginning to be paid. What is more, it has no effect on animals marketed today, and the right hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends know that to be true.<br><br>
Throughout this period of government, calf slaughterings have continued despite the subsidy. Between the beginning of March and the first week of June 1974, 85,100 calves were slaughtered, compared with 37,300 for the similar period last
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0311">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 165</span>
year. These are frightening figures, and they do not produce happy prospects for the country's future beef supplies.<br><br>
I now turn to a happier note and congratulate the Government. I do this personally. I welcome, as do the farmers of Scotland, the reintroduction of the lime subsidy. I pressed for this in my maiden speech, and it is gratifying to find that even back benchers are sometimes listened to.<br><br>
If I may move, not quite from the sublime to the ridiculous, but from lime to pigs, I have to say that the picture is not so bright. An original subsidy of 50p per score deadweight is slowly and continuously being eroded by a drop in the market price. By the beginning of June, the market price had dropped by more than 20p and almost half the value of that subsidy had disappeared.<br><br>
But, more serious than that, again this subsidy did nothing to stop the slaughter of sows and boars. The total rate in the United Kingdom of slaughters between the coming to office of the present Government and the beginning of June was up 47 per cent. on the total figure for the similar period of the previous year. Pig farmers in my constituency are facing vast financial difficulties, and most of them are now operating at a loss. It does not take much business sense to realise that this situation cannot; be allowed to continue if we still wish to have a pig-producing industry in this country.<br><br>
The future is no brighter because, at the moment, pig farmers are faced with the prospect of the Government removing the subsidy completely in September, and they are faced thereafter with even greater losses. What they seek, and what we seek today from the right hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends, is a long-term policy to restore essential confidence. What the pig farmers have received so far under this Government has been totally inadequate and totally ineffective.<br><br>
I now turn to another sector of the agricultural industry. The milk producers, too, are faced with an ever-worsening situation. There have been subsidies to hold the price, but they have not, and cannot, reverse what is perhaps the most frightening trend of all in agriculture. They have merely increased consumption in a commodity where production is reducing. In short, it is the classic recipe for severe shortages within a fairly short time and, ultimately, for rationing.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 166</span>
When I asked the right hon. Lady the Secretary of State for Prices and Consumer Protection a Question yesterday in the House, one of her ministerial colleagues answered merely that the price of milk was being kept steady. The housewife knows that a steady price is all very well when supplies are available to spend the money on, but a steady price for something unobtainable is worth precisely nothing. This is the sort of situation which the Government are allowing to grow within the milk-producing industry.<br><br>
The trend points to a milk and milk produce shortage within a fairly short time, and I believe that if this comes there will have to be rationing of sorts. What sort of rationing will the Government bring in? Will it be by forms and books, or by price? [<i>Interruption.</i>]
It is all very well for Government Members to shout "Panic", but when consumption is going up and production is coming down, it does not take a great economist to realise that the moment must soon come when there is a shortage. If the Minister can tell us today that he intends to reverse the trend, I and the dairy farmers of Scotland would like to know exactly how he will do this.<br><br>
Finally, I propose to deal with one or two specific items which are also related to the confidence of the agricultural industry. On the horticulture front, can the hon. Gentleman give an assurance that the subsidy on fuel oil for glasshouses will continue, in one form or another, after December? The problem is the same for horticulturalists as it is for pig farmers. Their prospects are desperate so long as no long-term policy of assistance is announced.<br><br>
On the general front, can the Minister give the perhaps more difficult assurance that the proposed wealth tax, the details of which we still await, will not be adduced to affect the working farmer, where the land is not so much a capital asset as the main tool of the farmer's trade.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If farmers are as poor as the hon. Gentleman says they are, they will not qualify for wealth tax in any case. The hon. Gentleman must at least be consistent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ancram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: the hon. Gentleman's question shows nothing so clearly as that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0312">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 167</span>
he does not understand farming. Last summer the value of a farmer's land rocketed, but it made no difference to the farmer whatsoever in terms of his profitability or anything else. It is time that hon. Gentlemen opposite realised that to a farmer farming land is the tool of his trade, and without which he cannot farm or produce. The very real fear of farmers about the wealth tax is tied to that.<br><br>
This has one more frightening implication, and that is that young farmers, whom we need desperately to come into farming to ensure the security of our farming industry over the coming years, are being put off by the threat of what they sec as a law of diminishing returns operating because of a wealth tax.<br><br>
To sum up what I fear has been a rather lengthy speech—although it is warranted by the seriousness of the situation—it is my opinion the right hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends are presiding over a series of agricultural policies which some might call madness, but there is a growing suspicion that there is a method in this madness. The Government seem to take the view that if, by these methods, they can hold prices and hold back the growing floodwaters until after October, it does not matter if the dam bursts after that.<br><br>
But if that is their purpose, they are playing politics with the nation's food supplies and threatening the future of the nation's food producers. They are threatening the livelihood of millions of farm workers who, by the nature of their employment, need a prosperous industry to secure a decent and acceptable income for the essential work that they do. The Government are playing roulette with the housewives' future. For the moment, the Government are able to maintain stable prices at the expense of a diminishing stock of future food supplies in the country. They know that the moment of truth will come, when short supply will inevitably cause prices to rise. The days of cheap food from abroad are gone, and the Government's continued complacency in this matter has become dangerous to the nation.<br><br>
Unless the Minister and his colleagues face the fact that the interests of food producers and consumers are inextricably linked, unless they are prepared to take requisite action now, they are in danger of going down in history as the Marie Antoinettes of the twentieth century, and10.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 168</span>
their fate in political terms may well be the same.</span></p>
<p>10 49 a m</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Hugh D. Brown)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think I have been likened to Marie Antoinette before. I feel more like a drowning man clutching at that rope which the hon. Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Ancram) was trying to throw to someone.<br><br>
I compliment the hon. Gentleman on his speech. I am sure that he will polish it up for the election, because it certainly was an election speech. I am not in the fortunate position this morning of being able to follow in the same tone, because I have a duty and responsibility to set a wider scene to show what the Government have done in the last few months. No doubt some of my hon. Friends will take up the debating points about a rationing scare and agriculture being a dirty word, although I do not recollect any hon. Member on the Government side having said that. It is not a phrase that I personally would use to describe an industry in which more than 40,000 workers are employed. I think that the hon. Gentleman under-estimates our sense of responsibility if he thinks that we would describe in those terms an industry which provides so much employment.<br><br>
I must apologise for the absence of my right hon. Friend. He has to be elsewhere, but no one is supposed to know where he is.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamish Gray</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does he know?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should not try to take advantage of my right hon. Friend just because he is not here.<br><br>
This is the sort of occasion where I can hardly wait to hear what I am going to say. I appreciate that I cannot crave the indulgence of Opposition Members to be charitable and tolerant with me for too long. I should make it known that I have a few friends in the farming industry, somebody unkindly suggested that they might be former friends, but that is not true. I am not just a Glasgow keelie who is totally unfamiliar with the smells of a farmyard.<br><br>
I welcome this opportunity of discussing agriculture. Scottish farming is sometimes
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0313">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 169</span>
overshadowed by industrial developments elsewhere in Scotland but, as I have said already, because it employs so many people and because of its importance to the community, the farming industry makes a substantial contribution to the economy and we are all concerned about seeing increased output and efficiency. Therefore, I shall go slightly wider than the two recent debates on the Floor of the House, which concentrated on the livestock sector, particularly on beef and pigs. That sector is of particular importance to Scotland, but I think that it would be right to take this opportunity of giving the Committee a more comprehensive view of the industry and its prospects. The hon. Gentleman covered a fairly wide area.<br><br>
Looking back to the year 1973–74, one sees that the value of agricultural output in Scotland is estimated to have risen by 30 per cent. as compared with 1972–73. Most of this increase—perhaps as much as 90 per cent.—was due to higher prices. Egg prices rose by three-quarters, cereal prices by two-thirds, poultry meat prices by more than one-half, and smaller increases were the general rule for most other commodities. In terms of volume, the increase amounted to about 3 per cent., which is similar to the average increase over the previous few years. This in itself is a tribute to the industry. Fat cattle production was the main contributor, and there were also increases in the volume of farm and horticultural crops, poultry meat and eggs.<br><br>
The increase in farm product prices was matched by large increases in farming costs due almost entirely to higher prices. Interest charges rose substantially, the feed bill increased by one-half, and a good deal more was paid by farmers for fuel, fertilisers, seeds and labour.<br><br>
In this, of course, agriculture is not dissimilar from many other industries. I am not suggesting that all the problems were left by the previous Government, but no one would be foolish enough to claim that the problems of inflation started after 28th February. Such things as the increase in interest charges, which have a significant effect on farming, certainly cannot be laid at our door. The hon. Gentleman was a wee bit unfair in what he said. He left the impression that the main theme of the Government's case was that all the problems had been caused by the previous Government.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 170</span>
It is too soon to say exactly what effect these changes in output and costs will have had on income in the year 1973–74. Average net income for all types of farm will have risen, but the increase is forecast to be considerably less than in the two preceding years. The performance of different farm types has, of course, varied considerably. Dairy farm incomes may have fallen back by about one-quarter to little more than their 1971–72 level, even after allowing for the special lump sum payment provided for at this year's review. On the other hand, arable farm incomes are expected to have risen substantially, and incomes in the hill and upland sector are also expected to have shown some improvement. I realise that it is dangerous to single out one section of this industry, because one can make a case for almost anything that way, so perhaps hon. Members will take note of that.<br><br>
I turn now to the prospects for 1975–76. I said at the outset that I did not wish to concentrate unduly on livestock. Nevertheless, this sector, which accounts for more than 75 per cent. of the industry's earnings in Scotland, must take first place in a general account of this kind. It is true to say that, whereas the previous administration had belatedly attempted to tackle the question of milk at this year's Farm Price Review, it had no solution for the problems of beef and pig producers. Equally, it had no answer to the problems of the beef rearer in the hills and uplands by whom, sooner or later, the backlash would be felt.<br><br>
Within a few weeks of coming to office, we increased the calf subsidy by £10 per head—more than double. No one should underestimate the importance of this for Scottish producers. About one-fifth of the calf subsidy is disbursed in Scotland, and the increase will give Scottish farmers about £7 million in a full year. Of that sum, two-thirds is estimated to go to farms that have been classified as eligible for the hill subsidies. To them, it is the equivalent of an increase of £10 or more in the hill cow subsidy. This was a substantial measure to safeguard future production.<br><br>
We have also reversed the decision of the previous Government to abolish the lime subsidy. The hon. Member for Berwick and East Lothian referred to this. This is also of special importance to Scotland. The Scottish share of the subsidy is £1·3 million, and it contains
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0314">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 171</span>
an element to offset the higher production and transport costs in Scotland. It is of particular benefit to the hills and uplands and to the islands.<br><br>
Of course, the prosperity of the hill cattle farmer depends above all on confidence in an adequate level of returns for fat cattle. Until June of this year, the fat cattle market remained remarkably firm, though everyone knew that there was a good deal of beef on the way. During 1973, average market prices for clean cattle in Scotland fell from an early peak to just under £21 per live hundredweight in January to remain fairly steady at about £18-50 to £19 for most of the year, and rising to a peak of just over £20 at the end of November. During the first half of 1974, prices were broadly comparable with 1973, despite the offering of more mixed quality. A peak of £19–94 was reached in early June, against £19–30 for the corresponding week of 1973. This may not have been high enough for those fatteners who had bought stores at very high prices last year, but it was high enough for the consumer.<br><br>
No Government can legislate for disappointed hopes or for miscalculations. I think that I have grasped the significance of that. It means, as I understand it, that people buy at a certain time in the expectation that prices will give them a good killing, and then find that things do not work out that way. There has been this element of miscalculation on the part of people concerned, and that is one of the problems with which we have had to deal.<br><br>
Last month, there was a substantial fall in the fat cattle market—which I am glad to say was much less pronounced in Scotland—but this has been reversed by the Government's recent actions in raising the guide price and in announcing preparations for the introduction of a support scheme at about £18 per live hundredweight. Hon. Members will not expect me to go into any detail on this. With the permission of the Committee and if I catch your eye later, Sir Myer, I shall reply to specific points, but, in view of the announcement today, it should be clear to everyone that detailed negotiations will be necessary before the administrative details involved in the announcement that was made on 26th June can be given. I assure the Opposition that this will be done with the greatest urgency. We fully

appreciate that farmers want to know the details as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ancram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman able to answer the point that I made about the figure of £18? Will it be a seasonal average of £18, or will it be an initial guarantee of £18?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, this is linked with the negotiations, so the short answer£2014;to be on the safe side£2014;must be "No". In other words, I cannot give the hon. Gentleman the guarantee that he is seeking. If I am wrong in that, I shall seek to advise the hon. Gentleman accordingly at the earliest possible moment.<br><br>
I turn now to consider the milk situation. What we are doing and have done for the beef sector will certainly help the dairy sector as well. I recognise its anxieties. I am as concerned as anyone that dairy producers should, over the year, have a sufficient margin of returns over costs to maintain the expansion in production that we all want. Milk marketing boards in Scotland have made their concern known. It is too soon, as the Chairman of the Scottish Milk Marketing Board has recognised, to predict the likely level of feed costs next winter. The previous Government were unable to assess the situation by the autumn of last year. We must be allowed to await the harvests in the northern hemisphere—this year's crop—before we make any decisions.<br><br>
Pigs, poultry and eggs are all commodities in which feed accounts for much the greatest part of the cost of production. Pig producers were faced with losses from the autumn of last year as feed costs rose and market prices fell. Nothing was done to help them until we introduced the 50p subsidy in March. Prices have not yet returned to a level which permits a reasonable profit, and we have therefore secured the continuation of this subsidy until the beginning of September, phasing it out over the following two months. The total cost of subsidy will be £30 million, of which £1¾ million will be payable in Scotland.<br><br>
There is no doubt that many producers of eggs and poultry are suffering losses at present price levels. That sector is accustomed to fluctuating returns, and during much of last year, and as recently as the beginning of this year egg producers were operating at a healthy profit. The remedy
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0315">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 173</span>
is, to a large extent, in producers' own hands, and it is good to see that, particularly in Scotland, they appear to be heeding the Eggs Authority and cutting back on chick placings not only for egg laying but for poultrymeat production as well. The price of poultry feed has fallen by about 5 per cent. since February, a trend which we hope will continue. I see no reason, given a sensible level of production, to doubt the continuing health of the poultry industry.<br><br>
Sheep production is more important in Scotland that in any other country in the European Community, and it is of particular importance in our hills and uplands. Sheep numbers are expanding after several years of decline, and there are signs that sheep production is once again becoming more important on arable farms. Fat sheep prices have been con- sistently above last year's levels, and remain so. This, combined with an increase in store prices over the year, gives promise of the continued profitability of this important sector.<br><br>
I do not believe that the prospects of the livestock sector as a whole give cause for despondency. In terms of volume of output, there are many indications that the 1974–75 agricultural year will be a successful one. Price levels are, however, more difficult to forecast than usual, and it has been the aim of the Government to take as much uncertainty out of the situation as possible.<br><br>
Beef output is expected to increase substantially in 1974–75, largely as a result of the expansion in the breeding herd in recent years. The provisional results of the June agricultural census show a further 6 per cent. increase in the beef breeding herd.<br><br>
The size of the dairy herd, and output of mutton and lamb, are expected to remain fairly constant.<br><br>
While there was a decline in pigs at the beginning of the year, with numbers in the breeding herd recorded in the spring down by 15 per cent. over the year, the provisional June results suggest an im- provement in confidence among pig farmers, with breeding numbers up by 5,000 since the spring.<br><br>
Production of poultrymeat is expected to be higher in 1974–75, although there may be some contraction in the egg-laying flock later in the year.<br><br>
I apologise for making a somewhat longer speech than usual, but I deliberately
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 174</span>
wanted in my first speech to try to cover what I thought were the main subjects, and it might be helpful to the Committee if I give some more information on the arable sector.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Teddy Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman leaves the question of beef, can he give us any indication or any news about whether consumers in Britain will be able to benefit directly or indirectly from the cheap beef appearing to be offered to all and sundry from the Community beef mountain?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman is an ardent supporter of Community intervention, I cannot give him that assurance, but I shall certainly try to find out. As the hon. Gentleman knows, the announcement was made only yesterday, and I have read it only briefly. The indications at the moment are that the answer must be "No", but I shall like to check that and mention it when winding up the debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If, as the hon. Gentleman suspects, the British consumer will not get the benefit of this meat, can he tell us who will benefit? Will it be countries outside the EEC, foreigners, Britishers, French or Russian?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not suspect anything. I said that I did not yet have the details of the announcement that had been made. I know that the hon. Gentleman is not speaking from the Front Bench. All I say is that whatever is decided—and there are still negotiations and details to be worked out—the Government will have in mind the interests of farmers and consumers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Frank McElhone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor) is being unusually clever. He studies the Common Market and its agricultural policy closely, and he knows that we shall not benefit from any of that surplus because the veterinary regulations do not allow continental beef into this country. The only chance that we have of benefiting is from the 12 per cent. of the surplus that is Irish beef.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not realise that we had so many agriculture experts on the

Committee. I take the point, but I am sure that hon. Members would not expect me to have details of something that was announced only yesterday.<br><br>
I am deliberately missing out some of the review items. I want to mention capital investment briefly, because I referred to the increased interest charges. The level of capital investment—and this must be an indication of what is happening in any industry—by Scottish farmers in buildings, fences, roads, and land improvement works belies some of the gloomy statements that have been made about the lack of confidence in the industry. Details of the amounts involved are available for anyone who is interested. That is an indication that there is confidence in this industry's future.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman did not mention animal health or welfare, and I do not propose to make any reference either to that or to swine vesicular disease, with which I am familiar now, though it may be mentioned during our debate.<br><br>
I intended to go into some detail on the crofting reform legislation, but again I propose to say only that the Government will formulate fresh proposals for legislation in consultation with the crofting interests. The Committee will not expect me to be able to say when the new Crofting Bill will be introduced, as another important event in the political calendar may intervene before that can happen.<br><br>
I welcome being thrown in at the deep end and given this opportunity of taking part in a debate on agriculture. The agriculture industry is of major importance, and its situation merits close attention by the Government and by this Committee. Farming is a diverse and complex industry. There will always be problems requiring sympathetic and urgent action, but, as in other industries which may be regarded as controversial in a party sense, we should beware of alarmist and noisy exaggerations which undermine confidence. Hon. Members should take this on board also, especially if they are guilty of ignoring, or taking little account of facts.<br><br>
During their short period of office, the Government have undertaken the careful and systematic appraisal of the industry's situation, of the problems inherited from our predecessors and those which have resulted from developments in world commodity markets. We intend
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 176</span>
to enable the industry to play its full part in contributing to the nation's welfare. Our aim remains to encourage the maximum economic production of food from the land, and if this aim is pursued with the co-operation of all concerned the result can be in the interests of farmers, owners, workers, consumers, and the national economy.</span></p>
<p>11.13 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Corrie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise to support what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Ancram), and to congratulate him on his excellent speech. I feel that I should also congratulate the Under-Secretary of State on his remarks this morning, for it is the first time that he has spoken on agriculture, and I promised in the Coffee Room that I would not be too sore on him until he got to know a bit more about the industry.<br><br>
I declare my interest, in that I run intensive dairy and intensive beef herds. The whole thing is done by computer nowadays, and forward predictions are there to be seen by all hon. Members who would like to look at them. One can see the problem as it really is.<br><br>
My hon. Friend in his opening remarks showed the deep concern in agriculture at the present time and the problems resulting from the falling off in confidence and the fall in profits. I want to show the other side of the picture and deal with the way that costs will spiral over the coming year. If something more is not done than has been done up to now, the next two or three years in agriculture will be very serious. The main difference between agriculture and any other industry is that if any other industry gets cost rises it can immediately pass them on to the consumer. In agriculture, unfortunately, we cannot do that. We are controlled by the prices that we receive for our products.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary of State mentioned the amount of capital investment going on at the present time and said that this indicated that farming was in a reasonably good state. I suggest that the reason for this is that grants came down quite recently from 40 per cent. to 20 per cent. and many people, including myself, put forward a lot of schemes at that time to make sure that they got the 40 per cent. grant. The culmination of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0317">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 177</span>
that is coming about this year. Perhaps after this year we shall find a severe drop in the amount of new machinery being brought into agriculture.<br><br>
In Big <i>Farm Management</i>this week there is an interesting article which states that a 200-cow dairy unit built in 1972, costing £38,000, or £190 per cow, would today cost £100,000, or £500 per cow, and that anybody putting up that unit from scratch today would be guaranteed a loss of about £2,270 in the year. This shows that one cannot invest large sums of money in agriculture.<br><br>
My hon. Friend said in his opening remarks that we were pleased to see the return of the lime subsidy. Scotland depends tremendously on lime for its acid soil, and it is very important that a lot of lime goes on to our land. As yet the calf subsidy has not filtered through and helped the store market. I hope that the Under-Secretary will make sure that payments of the calf subsidy will come through very quickly. Some farmers have written to me in the last week or two complaining that grants are not coming through for seven or eight months after jobs have been completed. I hope they will be able to get the extra £10 calf subsidy very soon.<br><br>
I say that the subsidy has not helped yet because last week at our local market the average was £13–50 for store cattle, while on the corresponding day last year the average was £24–30. There is, therefore, a long way to go yet. The Government must realise that confidence has not yet returned to the agriculture industry.<br><br>
Hon. and right lion. Gentlemen opposite must agree that tremendous cost rises in raw materials from abroad had an effect when the Conservative Government were in office last year. It was very difficult to convince the Opposition of that in the months after Christmas. I propose to list some of these rising costs to show how they will affect industry in the coming year.<br><br>
Basically, as the Under-Secretary said, one needs seeds, manures and feed to run a farm efficiently. Grass seed ordered last October 'for March, 1974, delivery was £11 an acre. The same seed is now £20 an acre and the projected price for next March is £24 an acre. Barley seed ordered last October for March delivery was £95 a ton. In April it was £112, and the projected figure for next spring is £122 to £127 a ton. As regards
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 178</span>
manure prices, in March this year nitrogen was £44 a ton while on 1st July it was £53·30 a ton. A good compound mix in March was £77 a ton, but in July it is £85·50 a ton. For basic slag, it was £10 a ton then, and it is now £16·50. This means that any farmer who spent roughly £9 an acre on manures this year will have to spend £22 an acre come next spring, which is a very severe rise.<br><br>
Phosphates, which are the basis of most of our artificial manures, used to come partly from America and partly from Morocco. They now come all from Morocco, and there has been a 320 per cent. rise in that raw material. The other basic material that is used is petroleum by-product, and we all know what has happened to that item.<br><br>
As the Under-Secretary said, feeding costs are easing. That will not affect the summer costs, but it is nice to know that at least next winter the price will come down by about £4 a ton. It has, however, gone up by about £22 a ton since last winter, and what happens next winter will depend on how good the harvest is in the coming autumn. The drought, for which I cannot blame the Government—unless it is due to all the hot air that has been blowing around—has severely affected crops, and hay, which is extremely scarce, is at present about £56 a ton compared with £24 a ton last year. All these costs will cause severe problems for the farming industry in the near future.<br><br>
Undoubtedly there are a tremendous number of cattle running in this country which would normally have been killed off by now, but no one can afford to sell them at the prices being offered in the market, and no one can afford to buy them without knowing that they will fetch a decent price at the end of the day. Can the Under-Secretary tell us what has happened to the O'Brien Report, and whether we shall be hearing something about it in the near future?<br><br>
The man who sells finished fat cattle is the man who must get the good price. If he gets a good price when he kills, he can afford to buy store cattle at a better price. This creates competition, prices rise, and the chain reaction goes right down the line to the breeder. Giving money to the breeder through a calf subsidy means that when a man buys store cattle he knows that the breeder has already got an extra £10, so he can buy his cattle
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0318">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 179</span>
a little more cheaply. That does not create competition.<br><br>
Farmers were encouraged to produce beef last year, and rightly so. Farming is a long-term business, as my hon. Friend said. It is a three- to five-year business, and one must make decisions in advance. I remember last summer coming home from the market with my stockman to find our stock Friesian bull in the garden and my wife screaming from an upstairs window, "Either that bull goes, or I go" My dairyman, who is a bit of a wit, said, "Don't make a decision too quickly, boss. He's a hell of a good bull" However, matrimonial bliss has survived, and there is a christening this afternoon to prove it.<br><br>
But there is a moral to that story. The Friesian bull did go, and in his place came a Hereford bull. I now have about 120 cross-Hereford beef calf at home that I cannot sell because their value is about £13 per cwt. this year as compared with £24 per cwt. last year.<br><br>
My hon. Friend was accused of scare-mongering when he suggested that there would be a shortage of milk this winter. I fully support him. If hon. Members get the Milk Marketing Board Bulletin for June, they will see the figures for themselves. In 1974, up to March, cow numbers were up from 266,000 to 271,000. In July, they are 8 per cent. down, and the Al figure is down by about 15 per cent. as farmers allow cows to run fallow. The result is that liquid milk sales have risen by 5 per cent., or about 6 million gallons, because of the penny subsidy to the consumer. That is an extra £500,000 in subsidy.<br><br>
Against that, output is falling rapidly, and Scottish butter production in March was down by 25 per cent., and in June by 36 per cent. That is extremely serious. In United Kingdom terms, it means about £15 million extra in imports during the coming autumn and winter. The May figures are very serious. There is a 36 per cent. drop in butter production, and a 45 per cent. drop in other milk products. As my hon. Friend said, it will probably lead to rationing in the coming winter.<br><br>
The Government must do something to restore confidence in the industry. I hope that the Government will give at least another 3p per gallon on milk before October, and will provide a reasonable floor price for beef in order to put back
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 180</span>
into the industry the confidence that was there under the Conservative Government last winter.</span></p>
<p>11.24 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Like the hon. Member for Bute and North Ayrshire (Mr. Corrie), I, too, am concerned about the O'Brien Report. Some of my constituents, notably the Cadzow family, are extremely concerned about it and would welcome a Government decision.<br><br>
I wish to raise one subject only, of which I have given notice to the Scottish Office. This concerns the scrutiny by the Scottish Office of draft instruments which come from Brussels. In raising this matter I had better say that I have the approval of the right hon. Member for Knutsford (Mr. Davies), the Chairman of the Select Committee on European Community Secondary Legislation and also of the senior Labour Member of that Committee, my right hon. Friend the Member for Battersea, North (Mr. Jay).<br><br>
It may be said that it is not up to Government Departments to scrutinise these draft instruments, and that the work should be done by the Select Committee. This is easier said than done, because the truth is that the Select Committee does not have anything like the assistance, the capability and the expertise that are necessary to enable it to pass meaningful judgments on what is really an absolute cascade of draft instruments and paper work. Any idea that, at any rate until October, the Common Select Committee can do the job that has to be done is far-fetched to the point of being an illusion.<br><br>
I will give two examples, one of which has been sorted out, and the other of which has not. The one that has been sorted out concerns the draft instrument on honey. This is Draft Instrument R608/74 dated llth March, 1974. Briefly, this draft instrument, which supersedes a previous Commission proposal of 1970, provides for the approximation of the laws of member States concerning the composition and labelling of honey. It forms part of the Community's agreed programme for the abolition of technical barriers to trade in foodstuffs. The impact on United Kingdom law is that, if adopted, this instrument will affect United Kingdom legislation on food composition and labelling and will require
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0319">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 181</span>
the introduction of subordinate legislation under the Food and Drugs Act 1955, and the corresponding legislation in Scotland, the Weights and Measures Act 1963. To cut a long story short, the outcome of this draft instrument would have been to require every beekeeper in the country to put a scientific composition label on the product that he was selling.<br><br>
Anyone who keeps bees knows perfectly well that this is a ridiculous requirement. Normally, in good years, beekeepers sell the surplus that accumulates in order to pay for the four or five hives that they may be keeping. Mr. McHardy, of The Scottish Beekeepers' Association, has put it to me this way:
<br><blockquote><p>"These draft regulations are, in my opinion, also absolutely preposterous. A beekeeper would seem to require an elaborate chemical laboratory and the technical qualifications necessary to use it, to ensure that his honey was fit for human consumption"</p></blockquote>
I put down a Question to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food asking how many people had suffered from grievous bodily harm, injury or even death from eating impure honey. The Committee will be surprised to hear that the answer was "None".<br><br>
The point that I want to come to is that putting down a Question and raising the matter on the Select Committee on European Community Secondary Legislation apparently helped to sort out this particular situation. The truth is that one member of the Select Committee happened to know a little about the subject under discussion.<br><br>
I am the first to say that there are many draft instruments about which I know very little. I have in mind the sort of thing about which the hon. Member for Bute and North Ayrshire (Mr. Corrie) was talking. If the hon. Gentleman were on the Select Committee, his expertise might be brought to bear on these matters. Truthfully, in this massive pile of stuff that comes to us, particularly on beef, I do not have any kind of qualification to pass a meaningful judgment. Therefore, the question that I ask, and about which I have given notice, is: what machinery now exists in the Scottish Office to scrutinise and filter this mass of rather important secondary legislation?<br><br>
If I am told that honey is not the most momentous issue that faces the British Government, I should like to put it in another way and go on to the second
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 182</span>
example, which concerns agricultural research. Draft Instrument COM(72)1587 provides for:
<br><blockquote><p>"the exchange of information and consultation between the Member States for the co-ordination of national research programmes at Community level and for the setting up of jointly financed arrangements to meet Community needs in this sphere"</p></blockquote>
Under the heading Impact on United Kingdom Law ", the instrument states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The area of law affected is that relating to Agriculture research. No legislative action will be required in order to implement the instrument"</p></blockquote>
Under the heading "Policy Implications", the instrument says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Acceptance of the proposals would promote rationalisation and economy by the pooling of resources and co-ordination in specific areas of agricultural research"</p></blockquote>
Some of us were a little curious about what was meant by the phrases "pooling of resources" and "economy" so, as is the right of the Committee, we asked the Minister of Agriculture, my right hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Peart), to appear before us. He brought along his Chief Scientific Officer, Dr. Pereira—a very distinguished scientist who is known to many of us—and Mr. Leitch from the Scottish Office. At the end of a rather difficult hour's questioning, I was as unconvinced as ever. Here was the Minister saying, "As political head of the Ministry of Agriculture I give an assurance that there will be no shrinkage in agricultural research", but what on earth does the draft instrument mean unless there is to be economy? Economy means shrinkage in any language.<br><br>
This is of great consequence to Scotland. What are we up to? If this means what it says, there will he pressure from Brussels for, at any rate, the shrinkage of certain parts of Rothamstead, certain parts of the Rowett, certain parts of the Moredun, and it may get down, for all I know, to agricultural colleges such as Oatridge in West Lothian. Either these instruments mean what they say, or they do not.<br><br>
This raises another issue. It is all very well to talk about European co-ordination in agricultural research, but the Rowett is doing research for an area where, plus or minus 10, there are about 180 photosynthetic days a year, and in Italy they are doing research for 300 photosynthetic days a year, plus or minus 20. We are dealing with entirely different conditions.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0320">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 183</span>
I raise the matter this morning because, after an hour's cross-questioning, some of us on the Committee were less convinced than ever that proper consideration had been given by the British Government to the effects of the monumental amount of directives that are being churned out. I am a pro-Marketeer, but I have suspicions that these instruments are being churned out by people who absolutely adore—as do serious Germans whom you and I know, Sir Myer—churning out directives for the sake of standardisation in areas of policy where standardisation may be less than satisfactory. I want to know, in the kind of situation where northern agriculture has totally different conditions from southern European agriculture, whether the proper scrutiny of this kind of draft instrument really exists.<br><br>
Having given him notice, I hope that the Minister will say something this morning about the machinery that exists in Edinburgh for scrutinising the effect on Scotland of these draft instruments. No one needs a more dramatic example than we have had this morning with the speech of M. Pierre Lardinois about the beef mountain. It is not my business to discuss the beef mountain, but let no one tell us that this is not important to us. I thought that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor) put a perfectly fair question when he asked in what circumstances the beef mountain would benefit, say, hospitals and old people's homes and those in the United Kingdom. I am not sure of the answer.<br><br>
I make the point once again that this kind of draft instrument, which may seem remote and esoteric, certainly affects us. That is why, in his winding-up speech, I should welcome some comments from the Minister.</span></p>
<p>11.34 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamish Watt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the hon. Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown) on his first swim. He says that he landed in the deep end, and I hope that he will soon be swimming in calmer waters. Indeed, every Scottish farmer wishes him a long and happy association with the industry. We hope that he will have a smoother swim than he has had in his first few days.<br><br>
I am a farmer, and as such I have to live strictly by the calendar. If I listened to the hon. Member for Berwick and East
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 184</span>
Lothian (Mr. Ancram) I should harvest in January, because he seems to have got either his calendar or my calendar terribly wrong. I cannot recall everything being sweet and light when the Conservative Party was in power. Perhaps the most disgusting scene that I have seen in this House since I arrived was that evening in May, in an agricultural debate, when all of a sudden it looked as if the Government would be defeated, and the Tories ran away.<br><br>
However, Sir Myer, I have no intention of looking back. I should like only to look forward, as any farmer must. We look at the situation as it is today. We should like to project it, and we should like, if possible, to suggest one or two methods whereby the industry can get out of its present troubles.<br><br>
The most simple thing, of course, would be to come out of the Common Market, but so long as we are stuck in there we sincerely hope that the Minister of Agriculture will do his best in the coming negotiations and that he will being back a decent deal for the Scottish beef producers. The basic problem is that the common agricultural policy is diametrically opposed to the best interests of the Scottish farmer.<br><br>
In Scotland, we have a gross over-supply of beef and gross under-supply of milk. Very few people seem to have taken that into consideration. Milk is in desperately short supply, as the hon. Member for Berwick and East Lothian said, and we may well have a very real shortage, come the winter months. In July and August, when milk is normally plentiful, the North of Scotland board is importing 400,000 gallons of milk from its neighbouring boards to see it through the summer period of peak demand. So it certainly seems as if milk will be in very short supply, come winter. We know that the Scottish Milk Marketing Board has plans to close down no fewer than three of its factories because of the projected shortage of milk.<br><br>
Despite the shortage of milk, the common agricultural policy goes ahead with its beef incentive scheme which encourages dairy farmers to go out of dairying and into beef production, adding still further to the beef mountain. In the Aberdeen Milk Marketing Board area, no fewer than 10 per cent. of the farmers have indicated their intention to give up the hard struggle of dairy farming and to move over to beef production, so there will be a still further increase in the supply of beef.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0321">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 185</span>
I ask the Minister of Agriculture to look very seriously at the position of the dairy farmer and to see whether he can get them an extra 2p a gallon in an autumn review to tide them over this coming hard winter. Last winter was hard, but I predict that next winter will be even harder. Feed costs have been rising steadily, and I am sure that they will go still higher in the coming winter. There may be a very strong case for the return of a feed formula such as operated so well with pigs over many years. If that feed formula could be applied to pigs, to eggs and to milk, I am sure that we could get the kind of stability that we seek in the industry.<br><br>
How can we get rid of this beef mountain? First, I suggest that it is essential to close the door to all imports now. So long as we are in a situation of over-supply ourselves, there is no point in bringing in meat from other countries. I know that this will be difficult, but I should like the Minister to press the Government to start again the export of live cattle. I know that the bleeding hearts in the Committee will raise their hands in horror, but from Scotland this was a very good trade, and there were never any cases of cruelty.<br><br>
As long as four years ago, the Scottish farmer deliberately took a decision and inseminated his cows with continental-type bulls—Charolais, Simmental and one or two others such as Gelbveih. The calves that were subsequently born have been fed and reared until they are now at the stage of being ready to go abroad to Europe to suit the market for which they were tailored. As one goes through the country one sees huge 14-cwt. and 16-cwt. bulls, all fighting fit to travel six or eight hours to the Continent and to reach a market for which they were specifically tailored. If these animals cannot get to that market because of the ban on exports, they will obviously come on to our own market to flood the beef supply still further.<br><br>
Turning to the question of pigs, I suggest that in this area alone real danger exists. So many sows have been slaughtered in the past few months that there will obviously be a big downturn in the supply of pork and bacon coming on to the market. Unless steps are taken now to redress this balance, the pig industry in Scotland will decline and it will take many years to recover.<br><br>

I do not envy the hon. Member for Provan his job. He has a very difficult task in the days ahead, and I wish him success in it, because on his success depends the future of Scottish agriculture in the years to come.</span></p>
<p>11.43 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Sillars</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to the opening speech of the hon. Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Ancram). He covered a very wide field in all parts of agriculture, but he said nothing about the farm worker.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, he did.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sillars</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He said nothing significant about the farm worker. That is no wonder, because I recall that at the time the farming industry was in a period of boom, the then Conservative Minister for Agriculture came to the Dispatch Box and boasted about how the change in support for the agricultural system had led the agricultural industry into a period of enormous expansion and great wealth. That was the time that the Government chose to freeze the farm workers' income. I remember my hon. Friend the Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) making a telling point on behalf of the farm worker during the passage of the prices and incomes legislation.<br><br>
I would like to ask my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown) whether he is satisfied with the situation that he has found. He has brought a fresh mind to the subject, and this is a good thing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member referred to farm workers' wages. Will he say specifically what they were in June, 1970, and in March, 1974?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sillars</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is at the old yah-boo stage again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a perfectly fair question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sillars</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I put it to the hon. Gentleman that, in my view, and in the view of the Labour Party, at the time when the industry was going through a boom period for everyone, the people who had helped the productivity and

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 187</span>
wealth of that industry were excluded from that boom because of the wage freeze introduced by his Government. Wriggle as the hon. Gentleman may, he will never get off that hook, and well he knows it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Rubbish.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sillars</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have no doubt that the hon. Gentleman will come back to this when he catches the Chairman's eye, but I really want to put a point to my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown): Will my hon. Friend ensure that when the Labour Government come to consider the annual price review they will write into it a specific element to take farm workers up to the income level of the average industrial worker on a 40-hour week? That is something which we should do for the farm worker in our community.<br><br>
I have another comment to make on what the hon. Gentleman said. He said that many Labour Members, who, by and large, represent industrial constituencies, regard agriculture as a dirty word. That is an unfair description of our attitude. I genuinely believe that there is a lack of understanding in the industrial areas about the situation in agriculture. That is not the fault of people in the industrial areas, and I have told farmers this in face-to-face confrontations. Indeed, I have had as many confrontations with them as I have had with the National Union of Mineworkers. The problem with the NFU is that it is much too content to engage in narrow bilateral talks with the Government. It never engages in a normal dialogue with the rest of the community, such as we get between the CBI and TUC.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ancram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman realise that, when the Livestock Committee of the Scottish NFU came down here the other day, it tried to see as many members of the Labour Party as possible? I realise that the committee saw the hon. Gentleman himself, and I think that members of the committee saw two other hon. Members.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sillars</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that that is accurate. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman does not understand the point I am making. The criticism that I have of the members of the farming community—
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 188</span>
and they know that this criticism comes from me—is that we hear their voices raised only when there are problems in the agriculture industry, whereas the rest of us are entitled occasionally to hear the farmers raise their voices on behalf of old-age pensioners and other groups in the community. If they were to do that more often, perhaps the industrial sector of society would respond better than it does when farmers have a genuine difficulty.<br><br>
There are too many wild speeches at NFU branch meetings about the housewife's days of cheap food being over and it being time that she paid a higher price. That does not help the National Farmers Union to get a receptive hearing from the rest of the community when it is in trouble. I do not want to carry on with that for long. I am not saying anything here that I have not said in public in my own constituency of South Ayrshire.<br><br>
I want to concentrate my remarks on the milk situation, but before doing so I should like to digress for a moment. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State would have been delighted to see the Press release from the National Farmers Union of Scotland dated 28th June, 1974, in which Mr. John Cameron, the Convener of the Livestock Committee gave a particular welcome to the certification scheme being introduced for beef. He would also be delighted with the concluding comment by Mr. Cameron. The Press release said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Turning to the reinstatment of the lime subsidy Mr. Cameron said:—` At last I can describe something as welcome without qualification. This is a first-class decision by the Government … The scheme in the past played a tremendous part in the hills and uplands and in the wetter districts of the west and its return is a victory for good sense.'"</p></blockquote>
I think that we are entitled to an explanation from the present Opposition why the lime subsidy was removed in the first place; why about £1·4 million was taken out of the Scottish agricultural industry. There was no explanation for that in the annual price review, but merely a bald statement that it was being abolished after 31st July, 1974. It was a remarkably foolish decision by the previous Government, and I think that everyone is delighted that the present Government have had the wisdom to reinstate the subsidy.<br><br>
I have many constituents in the dairy industry. They tell me that they face a crisis, and they have presented facts to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0323">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 189</span>
me by letter or verbally to illustrate the enormous costs of cattle feed and how the costs have risen by a large amount in the last 18 months. They have also pointed out the difficulties which they are experiencing because of the cost-push of inflation in many other commodities involved in the efficient working of our dairy farms. I believe them. I believe that they face a crisis in the dairy industry. From careful reading of the last major debate in the House on 26th June, I think I am right in saying that the Government also half believe what the dairy farmer is saying.<br><br>
In that debate, my right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I turn now to milk, pigs and beef, starting with milk. I have already referred to the situation last winter and to the action, which I support, that the last Government eventually took at the annual review to increase returns to the producer. In the months since the review milk production has not recovered as much as it might have done. That has been because of the effect of dry weather on the grass. But I recognise that the main concern of milk producers is over the level of profitability that they can expect for the year as a whole.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>At this time it is not possible to predict what the outcome will be. The level of feed costs during the coming months and through the winter will be a crucial factor in this matter. There has been some easing of the prices of dairy compounds in recent weeks, but how prices will move in future will depend heavily on the cereals harvests in the northern hemisphere."—[<i>OFFICIAL REPORT</i>, 26th June, 1974; Vol. 875, c. 1588.]</p></blockquote>
That passage acknowledges the damage inflicted by external events and also by the Conservative Government's inaction in the period before the annual price review. It further acknowledges that the review award did not repair the damage, and that events since then, both weather and continuing inflation, have left a large question mark over the dairy farmers' future and the future of supplies of milk and milk products this winter and next year.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend's remarks about awaiting the outcome of the harvest in the northern hemisphere, with a later passage in that speech exhorting dairy farmers to have faith in the future, is—I say with respect and implying no real criticism—not enough to reproduce the necessary confidence in the industry and avert a large-scale milk shortage this winter. It may be strange for someone to say in an agricultural debate that we cannot wholly rely on nature's treatment of the current harvest to determine the future for the dairy industry. If action is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 190</span>
delayed until very late this year, or—even worse—until the next price review, the industry could collapse. That is no exaggeration. Additional support is required now. I understand that Governments are harder to convince than back benchers, which is proper, for they have expertise and research at their disposal that we have not, but if the Government are not convinced of the industry's plight, they have given the impression of being at least half convinced. Will they consider establishing a joint working party between the Government and the dairy sector of the farming industry, to monitor events between now and 1st October this year? That would be a token of the Government's determination not to allow the industry to collapse: to accept the evidence from such a working party and act upon it, if it said that action was required.<br><br>
Even if the Government accept that suggestion, I have a question to put to my hon. Friend about the Common Market. My understanding is that, when we signed the Treaty of Accession, we signed away the sovereign right to introduce an interim price review award to agriculture in this country. I wonder whether my hon. Friend could confirm or deny that? If I am correct, and that right of action in agriculture was signed away, we have difficulties, even if we believe that we require an interim price review this autumn.<br><br>
I appreciate that 1 am urging additional expenditure on the Government—I do not want to load the additional cost on to the housewife—at a time of minus growth in the economy, when we have probably reached the limits of political tolerance in raising more general taxation from the body of citizens. I recognise that the consequence of extra expenditure in this sector is less expenditure elsewhere; it requires a reallocation of available Government money through a regrading of national priorities.<br><br>
A good guide to that for the Government would be to determine what we do need and what we can do without. In my view we can do without the Channel Tunnel and the forward implications for that, and—this is more controversial—Concorde, which is a technical luxury we cannot afford. I also believe that we can do without tests in the Nevada desert and the forward spending implications of chasing the illusion that we can maintain a credible independent nuclear deterrent.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0324">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 191</span>
But one thing we cannot do without is the agricultural industry and our milk supply from its dairy side. I am a member of the Tribune group, but I am not one of those Left Wing people who believe that the defence till can be robbed and robbed to pay for every alternative policy. I believe that the amount we spend on defence can be reduced substantially, but there is a limit to the reduction we can undertake. If I were given the choice in determining certain priorities and heads of expenditure, I would opt for fewer missiles and more milk.</span></p>
<p>11.56 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Steel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome much of what the hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Sillars) said and the spirited way in which he said it; but I would first congratulate the Under-Secretary on his appearance in the role of our protector in Scottish agriculture.<br><br>
I do not think that he should feel diffident or that he has to apologise for being a Glasgow Member when speaking on agriculture. I have long argued with my farming community that the curse of farmers has been the Tory farming politicians; and it is a good thing that somebody from the city should take responsibility for farming. Indeed, the reaction that the Under-Secretary has had this morning, with two other Glasgow Members bobbing up to contribute on agriculture, who previously had not distinguished themselves by their interest in the subject, was a good sign, and I hope that the farmers of Scotland will welcome his appointment and realise the significance that it could have.<br><br>
I also congratulate my neighbour, the hon. Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Ancram) on his speech. I agreed with most of it and thought it a very good speech, but I hope he will not take it amiss if I say that I thought it would have been a better speech if he had left out all the electioneering element. It is not fair to suggest that the crisis in agriculture—if we accept that there is a crisis in Scotland—all somehow began in March. He said it did not begin on 1st March; he then went on to suggest that it began on 23rd March.<br><br>
The truth is that last winter was a particularly serious time for agriculture,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 192</span>
and, as the hon. Member for South Ayrshire well knows, nowhere was it more clearly seen than in the dairy industry. Last autumn I visited a dairy farm, not very large as dairy farms go in the Borders, and looked carefully through the books and the accounts of that one farmer—which is often a better illustration than all the meetings and lobbying that go on—and I asked the then Government in the autumn to take urgent action to stop the losses in the dairy industry which would result in a cutback in production, but nothing was done about it until far too late. The whole winter went by, with the result that the North of Scotland Milk Marketing Board report last month said that milk production in the North of Scotland was the lowest for 20 years; and the effects of the slaughter of dairy cows are now being seen in the shortage of calves.<br><br>
We must, therefore, be fair and recognise that for the past year or two, regardless of which party has been in power, the farming industry has felt the squeeze, particularly in the rise in foodstuff and fertiliser prices. It was put very well by one of my local NFU office bearers, when he pointed out that the Scottish farmer was having to sustain the rise in the world price of foodstuffs and had suffered the same increase in costs as those elsewhere in Europe but was denied the prices which the European farmers obtained.<br><br>
There has been a danger of the same cycle that showed itself in the dairy industry occurring in beef. I hope that the Government's action will avert this. I impress on the Scottish Office the need, already stressed by several hon. Gentlemen, for an early date for the start of the return to certification, particularly if the calf sales in the autumn are not to be a disaster.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Berwick and East Lothian was right to point to 23rd March as a significant date. I believe that it was then that the Government denied our farmers the 12 per cent. increase in prices which farmers were getting elsewhere. Furthermore this is not really understood by the non-farming community—it meant that the British taxpayer, through the contributions we make to the agricultural fund, was paying for subsidised imports of beef. This was a serious matter to which far more attention should have been paid at the time.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0325">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 193</span>
It is not the cost of feedstuffs alone that has caused the economics of farming to change so dramatically. There are other costs. I want to raise one with the Minister, which I hope he will be able to answer. The cost of a simple commodity like baler twine, which is made of sisal and used particularly at the time of haymaking, has gone up from £210 per ton last year to £580 per ton this year. Not only has it gone up to that price but it now appears to be unavailable in many parts of Scotland. One farmer alleged to me at the weekend, at my surgery, that stocks of baler twine are being held in warehouses in Leith and in Aberdeen and are not being released on the market in order to force the price up artificially. I do not know whether that statement is true or not, but the extraordinary rise in cost and lack of availability of this commodity is something to which the Department should pay close attention now.<br><br>
One or two hon. Gentlemen have mentioned the economics of pig farming as well. It is useful again to take specific examples. A farm in my constituency last December was getting £33·42 per pig and foodstuffs then cost £80·50 per ton. By April this year foodstuffs had gone up to £90·40 a ton and the price they were getting per pig had gone down to £28·44. One can see from these figures that the complaints of the farming community are not just the old gramophone record but real and genuine grievances to which we must pay attention.<br><br>
Last, although I join in welcoming the return of the lime subsidy, I wonder why it has not been extended to slag as well. Slag prices now are about three times what they were five years ago. This is particularly important for Scotland, because in the hill and upland areas, especially if we are to encourage reclamation, it is important that the subsidy should be extended beyond simply lime.<br><br>
I hope that we shall avert any further cutbacks in the production of milk, beef and pigs. I do not think that it is necessary to raise the scare of rationing, but if we are to avoid food shortages of particular commodities, which is a real possibility, we must restore long-term confidence to the farming industry of the kind which they were enjoying a few years ago but which, in the last couple of years, has fallen away. That is what they are looking to, regardless of which
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 194</span>
party is in power. We have a duty as a society to increase home production of foods and give back to the industry the confidence it deserves.</span></p>
<p>12.4 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Frank McElhone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that time is short, Sir Myer, and that you have cautioned me to speak for only ten minutes. I should like to make a maiden speech in agriculture. May I say to the hon. Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Ancram) at the outset that my farmers did not come to see me when they lobbied Members recently, but that the point he makes about farming being a dirty word, especially in the minds of people like myself who represent an industrial area, simply is not true. I am prepared to say that we may not have taken the detailed and deep interest we should have done. That is because there are so many competing interests for a Member of Parliament's time.<br><br>
With the onset of the Common Market and the disastrous common agricultural policy, with the effect of rising costs on the consumer and certainly the effect on the balance of payments which the agricultural industry has, it behoves each one of us to take a much closer and more detailed look at the industry. The industry is certainly labour-intensive and it appeals to me in that regard, when so many jobs are disappearing because of automation.<br><br>
We must also note that there is now a marked absence of any cheap world food markets. There is no cheap food any more; therefore, if we are to keep the standard of living we want and save our balance of payments position, Government support for this industry becomes vital. Any moves to encourage Government support will have my support, because that will mean a stabilised industry and I hope that it will be reflected in stabilised prices for the consumer.<br><br>
I give a belated tribute to the hon. Member for Berwick and East Lothian on his first appearance on the Opposition Front Bench. I hope that he will not accuse me of being facetious if I say that I hope he stays on that side for many years. But he did bring in a scare—it is a scare that will be in the Press tomorrow—about milk rationing. It is grossly unfair to do so. There are no facts to prove that there is a possibility of milk rationing. We have had these scares in the past, they
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0326">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 195</span>
make the front page and they cause a great deal of dissatisfaction, especially in Scotland. While I accept that there is a shortage of liquid milk for the dairy industry and that there has been a reduction in the <i>amount of liquid milk</i>produced, I do not think that we are at crisis level either in Scotland or in England and Wales. I hope that when the Minister replies he will justify my point of view on milk rationing.<br><br>
I appreciate that this is the Minister's first speech on agriculture, but I should like him to consider the point made about the calf subsidy. We received the memos from the NFU and other bodies. While they welcomed the ·10 calf subsidy, they said that it still was not enough and made no significant effect on their perilous financial position.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Berwick and East Lothian talked about the wealth tax on farmers. If we on this side of the House do not have sympathy for the poor farmer, it is not because we do not accept that there are poor farmers. Too often from that side of the House, before he became a Member of the House, we had the cry about the council tenant with a Jaguar car. If we arc to have an understanding of the farmer who is poor and finds it difficult to earn a living, we should understand that not all council tenants have Jaguar cars outside their doors. We have heard that jibe too often from the other side of the House in housing debates.<br><br>
I should like to take up the point about beef, because beef has predominated in this debate this morning. Although the Minister gave us a wide-ranging report on Scottish agriculture, the beef position was predominant. I am disturbed to learn that a quarter of a million fewer cattle are being reared in England and Wales for beef production this year. What is the position in Scotland? If this reduction of a quarter of a million continues, it must have a severe effect on beef prices, perhaps not in 1975, but in years to come. This industry needs a stabilising period. I accept one criticism of this and other Governments, although perhaps it is too soon to criticise the Government, that this industry has not had the encouragement of long-term proposals. Farmers who were encouraged to switch from milk to beef are now in the predicament that beef prices are falling, and the milk position, especially with regard to dairy farming,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 196</span>
is not good either. I am sure that one could go right through the industry, to horticulture, poultry and other things and say the same thing. As I say, if we are to have a stable and viable industry, we must get down to long-term proposals.<br><br>
I am very much worried that we have a beef mountain building up in the Common Market alongside the butter mountain. If the suggestion of selling cheap beef to the Russians is pursued, we shall soon find an analogy with the old claim that the Labour Party owed more to Methodism than Marxism. If the Russians get hold of this beef on top of the butter, they will soon be able to say that they owe more to the Common Market than to Communism. I hope that the situation will be looked at.<br><br>
The point that I made in an intervention was that we cannot benefit from this beef surplus because the veterinary regulations do not allow us to import continental beef. I wonder if this situation can be corrected. If there is a surplus of 5,000 tons of beef every week, I should like to think that the British housewife could benefit from it—although, as I mentioned, we can benefit from the excess on the Irish market, which, I think, is 12 per cent, of the surplus. But I read in the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>that there is a strange piece of monetary lore called the "green pound" I was not aware that there was such a thing, but I understand that the green pound is used in dealing with agricultural imports and exports, and that the Irish intend to go to the Commission for a devaluation of the green pound, which will mean that this country could face higher prices for beef.<br><br>
Perhaps this is a rather dramatic question to put to a Minister at short notice, but I should like him to give me some information, perhaps by letter, on the Irish subsidy and the fact that we are prepared to consider a devaluation of this green pound, if Brussels permits, which will have an adverse effect on the British housewife, and the Scottish housewife in particular.<br><br>
It is tragic that, while we have a beef mountain and many ships are lying idle because of the depression in the shipping market, we read in the Sunday Times last Sunday that about six million people in the world are at starvation level. We read that 100,000 Asian children will go blind each year because they do not get the vitamins they need. Surely, with all our United Nations and Common Market
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0327">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 197</span>
organisations, there must be some scheme by which this excess beef mountain or butter mountain can be used, along with idle shipping, to alleviate the poverty and misery in other parts of the world. Our compassion should stretch a little more than it usually does and should not end on a harvest festival Sunday. If we are to talk as compassionate politicians, we should do so in the wider context of feeding developing countries who face appalling problems of starvation.<br><br>
May I make three brief points, Sir Myer? The first is about high interest charges, which face everyone who owns a farm, a business or a house. Although there is a scheme for helping farmers with finance, I am informed that it is only .1½ per cent. less than the normal lending rate and that it does not apply to tenant farmers. Surely, if industry and certainly tenant farmers, are to be encouraged, we should be presenting some scheme that will allow farms to develop greater efficiency. We are told that computers are coming into farming; soon metrication will come into farming. To make industry efficient finance is needed. I do not like to think that the efficiency of the industry will suffer because tenant farmers and young farmers cannot get the necessary capital to make their farms more efficient.<br><br>
Can the Minister tell me how many farmers or farm workers are encouraged to make use of our agricultural colleges? This information rarely comes out. I make these points only because we are in the same dilemma that we are always in during estimates debates: the statistics available to us are hopelessly out of date. Those that we have been presented with this morning are the agricultural statistics for 1972, which are based mainly on a census of June, 1972. I made the same point from the Opposition Front Bench last year on social welfare and housing. It is hard to make a detailed and objective analysis when one is talking about figures of two years ago. That is something which the Scottish Office will have to look into. I made this criticism of the last Government and I am making the same criticism of the present one.<br><br>
I should like to touch on many other issues, such as swine vesicular disease in Scotland and whether a ban should be reimposed—a reasonable course of action in the light of the figures we have had for this disease. I should like to touch on other points with reagard to the CAP.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 198</span>
But I rest on the view that there is a need for stabilisation of the industry, for injection of finance, and for the encouragement of tenant farmers. I hope that a scheme for financing tenant farmers will be thought up by the Government, in order to ensure that not only the industry, but the consumer, will benefit.</span></p>
<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Russell Fairgrieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I compliment and support my hon. Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Ancram), who has made a fine speech. I mention one point for the sake of the record. He talked about the fault of both parties but he mentioned a specific date—23rd March. That was the date on which all support was taken away from the beef industry. That should be made clear. It was the day on which the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food could have got a 12 per cent. advance and he took only 6·3 per cent. Under the transitional arrangements he actually could have got 17 per cent. I agree with the hon. Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles (Mr. Steel), who also supported the common agricultural policy, that we could have had benefits from it and did not take them.<br><br>
I am sorry that the hon. Member for Banff (Mr. Watt) has left. He was talking about the Common Market. I wondered if he thought that the CAP was something one puts on one's head when one is mucking out the byre. The CAP has done another thing for us recently. Were it not for the CAP, we should not have had the advantage during the last year of reasonably-priced wheat from France. We should have had to pay far more to get it from America.<br><br>
Turning to the present position, farmers welcome the increase to £18 for fat cattle, but when I was talking to them in Aberdeen Mart last Friday, they all said that it was too low. It should be £20 in order to get an economic price.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister, in his reply, will tell us when the Government will implement the O'Brien Report. I have asked twice about this on the Floor of the House, and on the second occasion the Minister of Agriculture told me that he would be giving a reply shortly. I hope that it will not be long before we have a definite reply.<br><br>
Finally, may I make a point about production, surpluses, mountains and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0328">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 199</span>
that type of thing? Here I find myself in the odd position of supporting the hon. Member for Glasgow, Queen's Park (Mr. McElhone). I believe that British agriculture—and, for that matter, Euro-pean agriculture—should produce to itsmaximum. Thereafter, if there are surpluses and mountains, surely there is a way to dispose of them without all this talk of giving something cheap to the Russians. This country, like Western Europe, gives barely 1 per cent. of its GNP to the third world—that is, the two-thirds of the world's population who are starving. Why do we not do it in kind as well as money by giving this surplus food to these parts of the world? We should thus maintain the highest possible British and European production.</span></p>
<p>12.18 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown). He was speaking, he said, not quite as a Glasgow keelie, but he spoke very authoritatively on agriculture. 1 also congratulate the hon. Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Ancram) who fairly put over an extremely good case—although, as my hon. Friend the Member for Provan said, he made some debating points and some rather sweeping statements, particularly about the milk situation.<br><br>
However, he is not the only person I have heard say this. Some farmers in my constituency with whom I was speaking during the election were also afraid that that position might arrive. One of the crazy situations in our economics is that a pint of milk is compared with a pint of lemonade, when there is no comparison between the two. The Government in their prices policy did bring down the price of milk by 1p a pint, but that money would have been better spent in helping the farmers themselves and perhaps also in bringing back milk for primary school children over the age of seven, which was taken away during the last Government's period of office.<br><br>
One of the things that always amazes me is the attitude taken by the Opposition in a new Parliament. Both in 1970 and on this occasion, as one listened to the speeches from the Opposition benches, it appeared that all the Government's problems would be solved if only they
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 200</span>
would listen to the Opposition. In so many instances, the Opposition are accusing the Government of doing something that they should have done themselves when they were in office. I think this sometimes looks a little phoney, particularly to newcomers to Parliament. As the Government have emphasised, the problems of agriculture have not arisen just since March. Hon. Gentlemen opposite could have done much more to help the farmer if they had so wished during their period of office.<br><br>
One of the best Public Relations exercises which is carried out to Members of Parliament is that of the National Farmers' Union of Scotland. We are always being given hand-outs about its position on various matters. One of the trends that has been seen in these hand-outs is a dwindling in the all-out support for a common agricultural policy. Farmers in Scotland have shown that their confidence in the CAP is continually being eroded. I believe my hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Sillars) has commented on the latest Press release we have had from the National Farmers' Union of Scotland, about the Government's action on beef and in particular on the subsidy for lime, and I am sure that this is welcomed throughout the whole of the farming industry. I know, through my association with the local farmers in Dunbartonshire and the local farmers' union committee, that they are certainly very pleased with this.<br><br>
I should like to take up a small point which is very much in the minds of farmers who farm land near towns. That is the matter of worrying by dogs. I have raised this matter with successive Governments to see what they could suggest to overcome this rather serious problem. I put forward a suggestion that there should be a substantial increase in the dog licence fee. I am quite sure that the price of a dog licence these days would cover only the administrative costs of producing it, and that if there was a proper system of licensing with a proper identification of the animal, and in particular a large increase in the cost of the licence, this would be one way of cutting down this problem, which is serious for many farmers.<br><br>
I was very pleased indeed to hear my right hon. Friend and my hon. Friend the Member for Provan say that the Government are prepared to go all the way for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0329">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 201</span>
maximum food production. This is essential. Several hon. Members have spoken this morning of the difference that this would make to our balance of payments. This is a most sensible way of reducing it and also of reducing our dependence on food supplies from overseas; I am glad that this is also the view of the Government.<br><br>
It was stated earlier that many hon. Members on this side were not interested in agriculture. I can assure hon. Members opposite that we are. As my hon. Friend the Member for Provan said, there are 70,000 workers in this industry and we want to ensure that agriculture remans a healthy industry. My hon. Friend can certainly count on my support for any move to improve the stability, the efficiency and the prosperity of the farming industry in Scotland.</span></p>
<p>12.25 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, may I warmly congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Ancram) on a first-rate speech. Coming as he does from an agricultural constituency, I would have expected his expertise and I am sure his constituents realise that they have in him a representative who knows about this subject in great detail.<br><br>
Second, I should like to congratulate the hon. Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown) on his maiden speech on agriculture in this Grand Committee. We know from the care, the interest and the research that he has put into his work in many other areas in the House of Commons that he will serve agriculture well. I should declare that, for the last ten years in the House, I have been involved in agriculture and that I am a member of the Scottish Farmers' Union.<br><br>
I should like to refer back to the period when I first came into the House, the middle 1960s, when, both here and in Scotland, there was a decline in agriculture. This was particularly so in the hill and upland areas where profitability disappeared altogether. The word that has been used most frequently this morning by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee is "confidence" Confidence disappeared then as it is doing at present. One must bring home to everybody, not only to the members of the Committee but to the consumers and the farmers, how important confidence is when one is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 202</span>
planning an expansion in production in all spheres of agriculture. I indicated that the trend in the 1960s was singularly disappointing and as early as possible after the General Election in 1970 we brought in an emergency price review to retrieve the bitter legacy of the policies that we had inherited.<br><br>
I believe it is right today in this Scottish Grand Committee to discuss agriculture, because it is especially important to Scotland, where there is a predominantly livestock-rearing agricultural economy, and where hill farming has a very special place. I think that the policies that we adopted from 1970 onwards brought expansion. Agricultural production went up by 36 per cent. in three years. Farm incomes doubled and farmers were able to obtain a fair return on the vast amount of capital that is involved in modern agriculture. That was reflected in new buildings and increased stocking rates and will eventually bring a benefit to the consumer and to the balance of payments.<br><br>
It is important to the rural economy of Scotland that agriculture should do well. It affects the grain merchant, the engineer, the blacksmith, all the shops and services. If agriculture does well, so do they. So it is important in a wider context than that of agriculture itself.<br><br>
I am equally glad that during our period in office agricultural wages went up by 66 per cent. The impression given by the hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Sillars) was wrong and unfair because farmers are very keen to pay the highest possible wages in relation to the profitability of their farms. I hope that this trend will continue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sillars</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman leaves that point, how does he justify on page 29 of his own annual price review the fact that average earnings and hours of agricultural workers in the year ended September, 1973 were £26·42 in 1973 for a 47·6-hour week? How can he possibly justify that in the face of his statement?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I quote back to the hon. Gentleman the fact that in June, 1970 the average wage was £13·15 which I am glad to say we increased to £21·80. I think the hon. Gentleman should also bear in mind that the majority of farmers do not pay the minimum wage. They pay considerably more, and I am very glad that this should be so.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0330">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 203</span>
I would say in defence of my hon. Friend that he made it very clear that there were difficulties during the past winter. T openly accept that and would never try to hide it. But it was certainly brought on and accelerated by the exceptionally high world grain prices.<br><br>
I appreciate the difficulty in making forecasts, but has the Minister any ideas on how he thinks things will go from this harvest onward? I know we have recently had a major wheat agreement between India and the United States and the forecasts for the grain harvest appear to be only average. The exact amount in reserve at present is not clear, but as the price of barley may well be the key to the economy in agricultural terms next winter, it will be interesting to know whether he has any forecasts in mind.<br><br>
I accept that through last winter the rising cost of grain caused exceptional difficulties; many of us will have met our National Farmers Union branches to discuss this. That is why we brought forward the price review to the earliest possible date, as early in February as it could be produced. I am glad that the award of £145 million which effectually made an increase of 5p a gallon on milk had a tremendous impact on that side of the industry.<br><br>
What is important is that there was further action to follow in March in the beef and pig sectors of the industry. The then Minister had made it quite clear that he would go back to Brussels on 11th March to conclude his discussions. I know that if my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) were here, he would confirm this. But instead of continuing the progress we expected in Brussels in the early part of March, the present Minister, from 21st to 23rd March, in our view took the wrong action, particularly in relation to beef—for what reason other than his antipathy to the Common Market it is very hard to follow, but it has cost farming and the country dear. The principal crime, which has been highlighted throughout the debate this morning, was to remove the floor from the market and the fallback position of intervention buying.<br><br>
In February, the average price of beef was around £19 at the end of the month. At the end of June it had fallen to £17·22— and I am talking in United Kingdom terms. That meant that some fat cattle went to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 204</span>
the market at as low as £15 per cwt. Therefore the efforts of the right hon. Gentleman to sustain the market had failed. If he had succeeded in what he set out to do in Brussels in March, there would have been no need to return to the EEC last month, or, indeed, to put forward the further proposals which I shall certainly welcome in a few moments.<br><br>
I believe that one must accept in the face of the agricultural debate we had at the end of last month, that the right hon. Gentleman had to take steps. There would certainly have been a defeat in the House if he had not seen fit to agree with the motion before the House on 26th June. Therefore, I am glad that the pressure by the farmers' union and by the Opposition has had some effect.<br><br>
But the right hon. Gentleman's return to Europe underlined his failure in March because of the decisions about which he was given a clear warning in the House of Commons. I think he made a serious blunder, supported by the Secretary of State for Scotland, and I thinkhe accelerated a then deteriorating situation into a disaster for many livestock farmers.<br><br>
In March, the Minister proposed—and this was brought out by the hon. Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles (Mr. Steel)—to increase the guide price by only 6·3 per cent., when he could have had the 12 per cent, of the EEC increase or, indeed, the 17 per cent, obtained by Ireland for those new members on a transitional basis. It is fascinating to note that the new floor of £18 that he announced last month very nearly equates the £17·90 that he could, and should, have obtained had he accepted the 17 per cent, rise in March. So the Minister is back where he should have been—he has taken a complete somersault from the position of 23rd March.<br><br>
If the right hon. Gentleman had obtained and operated a 17 per cent, increase in the guide price and retained the possible use of intervention, he would have avoided the subsidisation of beef in the form of the TCAs for the importers of beef from the EEC to the United Kingdom—again the point brought out by the hon. Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles. By not taking the action that he should have taken, the problem was accentuated.<br><br>
It was the loss of confidence in farming and the meat trade as a result of the removal of the floor and intervention buying that was the right hon. Gentleman's
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0331">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 205</span>
most criminal miscalculation. The Conservative Government removed the deficiency payments system, which was already creaking at the seams, on the clear understanding that it would be replaced by CAP guarantee, and the Minister broke that understanding, with catastrophic results. The Minister removed for the first time since 1947 a floor in the market and a guaranteed price. I accept, and one can see from what has been happening this week, that the CAP needs careful work and much improvement, but to remove the market floor was a catastrophic mistake.<br><br>
I appreciate the Minister's difficulties, but I ask him to try to tell us a little more about the £18 slaughter premium. We know that the Meat and Livestock Commission and other experts say that it takes £22·50 to produce quality beef at the present time. Therefore, even at present prices many farmers are losing £20 to £40 per head. Can the Minister tell us how the scheme may operate, because it is of paramount importance in forward planning? One is concerned that, if we hold off for too long waiting for this information, it might increase the amount of beef coming on to the market, perhaps next month. Certainly we do not in any way want to talk down the market, if we can avoid that by giving information as soon as possible.<br><br>
I appreciate that the £10 calf subsidy will be valuable to those rearing calves, but it will not help those who bought their calves last year and fattened them through the winter and the summer. We believe firmly that the £10 is put in the wrong place.<br><br>
I appreciate, also, that the Government acted in terms of heating oil and pigmeat. All this added up to a total of about £78 million in a United Kingdom sense. But I hope that that will be borne in mind in relation to the total increase in costs alone of agriculture last year of £800 million. One can see what a discrepancy can arise in terms of prices in an escalating situation. The National Farmers Union of Scotland welcomed the Minister's announcement last week as a first step forward, and so do I, but we shall be interested to know as soon as possible—obviously not today because there has not been time to find out—what impact the Minister's recent statement has had on calf slaughterings. As my hon. Friend indicated, they have doubled since this time last year. It is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 206</span>
important to realise, and to bring home to the consumer, that the production of beef is on an 18-month or 20-month cycle. One cannot turn on or shut off beef production day by day.<br><br>
It is very important—and this has been highlighted—that we should reflect on what may happen in the store markets this autumn. So much of the income of the hill farms of Scotland comes from suckler calf sales. If the prices are far below what they were last year—I appreciate that they were good last year—hill farmers in Scotland will certainly be affected. If the Minister can give any indication of how he thinks the store market will go, I shall be very pleased to hear from him.<br><br>
We have heard from my hon. Friend the Member for Bute and North Ayrshire (Mr. Corrie) that the store market, particularly in terms of black and white cattle, is very depressed at this moment—perhaps £13 and £14 per live hundredweight. There will be a very serious situation if that remains the price for beef cross cattle that come on to the market at the end of September and through October.<br><br>
We have talked about pigs today, and the fact is that the trade was very sticky last September and October. It was hoped that feed levels might ease off, but they did not. Despite that, the situation improved marginally in November, December and January, but by March the situation was again extremely serious. We are used to this cycle in the pig trade, but it is serious at this moment. The Government injected the 50p a score into this sector, but we accept that it will begin to phase out again in September and will be gone in November. Can the Minister say anything about the longer term position regarding pigs?<br><br>
I appreciate that the Minister will not have had a great deal of time in which to collect his thoughts, but there are a number of questions that I would like to have had answered and the hon. Gentleman may well be prepared to answer them. First, when and how will the slaughter premium work? What does the Minister think the store market for cattle will be this autumn? What will be the position in relation to pig meat after November, when the 50p a score is completely phased out?<br><br>
The situation regarding milk is as serious as hon. Members have said. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Queen's Park (Mr. McElhone) tried to indicate
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0332">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 207</span>
that there was nothing particularly serious about the present situation, but I think we would all accept the word of the Chairman of the Scottish Milk Marketing Board as being above reproach. In The <i>Scottish Farmer,</i> under the heading "Dairy recession could be a disaster" he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"With milk production and average yields per cow tumbling well below last year's level, the present recession in the dairy industry will become a disaster unless the Government take action soon"</p></blockquote>
This is reflected by the English Farmers Union in its Press release last week, so we must not take the milk position lightly. There was talk at the Royal Show last week that there might be 2p a gallon in the autumn. It will be interesting to know from the Minister whether that is likely to be true.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McElhone</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I am racing the clock to give the Minister time to reply.<br><br>
The situation in the poultry and egg market is, of course, serious. The fall in the price per dozen eggs has been about 9p or 10p in the past few weeks—from 27p which it costs to produce, to the selling price now of 18p.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Lawson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I really must not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Lawson</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Did the hon Gentleman make a proper declaration of his own interst before he started to give us this tirade in the interest of one section,and one section only,of society?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I gave a full declaration of my interest in agriculture.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>:.A full declaration of interest One sees farmer after farmer on the Opposition benches.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I am sad that tha hon Gentleman is leaving the House and Ihope that he dos not depart in such a contentious way If the hon gentleman had been her for longer than the past 20 minutes,he would a lod this morning.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 208</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lawson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have been here all morning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to go back to what I was saying and ask the Minister about the position regarding eggs, because the egg producer is facing a serious situation.<br><br>
Can the Minister tell us what is likely to happen in relation to heating oil after December? Already the subsidy has dropped from 6p to 4p, and it will disappear in the winter. This is most important in the long-term planning of the horticulture industry.<br><br>
I should also like to know whether the hon. Gentleman has anything to say on the O'Brien Report on the export of livestock. There are other questions which I should like to ask, but I promised that the Minister would have a quarter of an hour in which to reply, and I shall not continue with my speech. I hope that the debate has brought home to the Committee and to all those concerned how important agriculture is in the longer term, not only from day to day; how prices today—which the hon. Member for Motherwell and Wishaw (Mr. Lawson) should bear in mind—affect the amount of production next year and in succeeding years.<br><br>
If we want to get the balance of payments right and the food there for the consumer, we must have longer term planning in the interests of the consumer. If we do not have increased production, the consumer will not have the opportunity to benefit from that increased production.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lawson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman telling us that the consumer is getting food too cheap?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Two weeks ago the House accepted the motion:
<br><blockquote><p>"That this House calls on Her Majesty's Government to take immediate steps, especially in the livestock sector, to safeguard the future supplies of home grown food for the consumer.—[<i>OFFICIAL REPORT,</i> 26th June, 1974; Vol. 875, c. 1577.]</p></blockquote>
If the Government are to fulfil the promise given by accepting that motion, we shall want to know what action they will take in the immediate future. If not, the Government will stand condemned for the failure of their own agricultural policy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lawson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State comment on the

fact that, important though the farming interest is, there is on the Opposition side of the Committee virtually no voice but that of the farming interest? Will my hon. Friend say a word about the consumer?</span></p>
<p>12.46 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take the point.<br><br>
I am curious to see how HANSARD will report what I would describe as croaks coming from the Chair. At least I heard you, Sir Myer, and I hope that I shall remain in order, whatever difficulty you had earlier today.<br><br>
I am not complaining about the time factor, but I do not think that the hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) would expect me to reply in detail to the many points that he raised. I touched on some of them in opening the debate. I am grateful to him for posing all the questions, and I shall read his speech with as much interest as I shall read my own. I shall go over in detail all the points that he made and if I do not cover them in the general reply I shall write to the hon. Gentleman and discuss matters with him in due course.<br><br>
Probably the most important thing that came out of the speech of the hon. Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Ancram) was the general question of the new arrangements on beef support. He asked specifically whether it was seasonal or average. The details of any beef support scheme are clearly a subject for discussion, as the hon. Gentleman knows. I remind the hon. Gentleman of the tenor of the statement made in the debate on 26th June, when my right hon. Friend said that we would need to be in a position to give producers an assurance covering a period, that their returns will not drop below about £18 per live hundredweight for clean quality cattle. It is most unlikely that this could be achieved by a seasonal scale, but again the hon. Gentleman will appreciate that this is still the subject for detailed discussion, and no doubt he will be aware of the fact that there is a meeting next week. I think that we may be in a position to supply some of the details in the near future.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor) in an interjection—and I am taking this up because this is also a matter of some public interest—raised the question of intervention beef and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 210</span>
asked whether old-age pensioners would get it. Again, I cannot give a specific reply. These are only proposals at present. They will be the subject for discussion. There is a change which appears to be included in the proposals—and I repeat that they are only proposals—which I should have thought the hon. Member would have welcomed. When surplus supplies of subsidised food are available, it now looks as though, instead of selling such surpluses to the Soviet Union, they will be used by the members of the Community for sound social purposes. I repeat once again that these are only proposals which are subject to discussion but I am sure that the matter will be followed with great interest by all hon. Members.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the news this morning it was stated as a fact that Britain would not stand to benefit by these proposals because we had departed from our adherence to the CAP in respect of beef prices. That is the matter of public interest at the moment: whether that is true.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not trying to make any particular party point here, but hon. Members on both sides cannot have it both ways. If there is common agreement that there should be some renegotiation of CAP, there may, in the transition period—which everybody recognises that this is—have to be some give and take in detailed discussions on one aspect. Hon. Members, with their long experience in every kind of negotiations, will appreciate that. I certainly should not jump to any conclusion about what has been said so far until we have had proper examination of the details.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has been fair in saying that these are only proposals. We should like to have from him an indication that the policy of Her Majesty's Government will be to seek to obtain these supplies for Britain. Is this the policy or is it not?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The proposals have only just come out. The hon. Gentleman is not going to trick me into declaring Government policy in the course of an interruption like that. I have already outlined, I thought, quite fairly, what I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0334">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 211</span>
think may be the outcome of the discussions. It is certainly something that will be kept in mind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You are the Government now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give the hon. Gentleman the assurance for which he asks. I have already said so, and there is no point in his getting huffy about it. It is one of the things that will be looked at carefully. It is our job as the Government to protect the interests of the farming community and the consumers: that we shall do, but the details of how we shall do it I clearly cannot go into at this stage.<br><br>
Perhaps I may reply briefly to the hon. Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Ancram) on his question about a wealth tax. I am giving no assurances here. As I said, agriculture suffers from the same problem of inflation as other industries. I know that the industry has some peculiarities, and I think it would be reasonable for any Government to look at any future tax in the light of special circumstances that might perhaps be found to apply to agriculture. That is not giving any promises: it is merely saying that I recognise that there may be some need to look at agriculture because of some of the points that hon. Members have raised.<br><br>
The other thing that he and the hon. Member for Dumfries mentioned was the fuel subsidy to growers with glasshouses. The Government introduced this subsidy, covering a full calendar year, to enable growers to adjust to the greatly increased fuel costs. It is too soon to assess the future level of profitability, but naturally we shall consider any representations, and the points made today, in deciding how it might be continued or what might take its place.<br><br>
I turn to some of the other points. Some hon. Members raised the subject of animal welfare and the O'Brien Report. This is being actively pursued. There has been pressure from both sides of the House on this. The Leader of the House has given an assurance that the report will be debated in the House. I do not think any promise has been given as to when, but it will be debated before any legislation is forthcoming.<br><br>
I take the point made by the hon. Member for Banff (Mr. Watt) that this is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 212</span>
a matter of concern. The report to some extent vindicated or justified existing arrangements for the bulk of exporting, but the hon. Gentleman will recognise that there has been pressure from both sides, and it is something that will be given urgent attention.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell), in his usual courteous fashion, gave me notice that he intended to raise the matter of bees. On the general point, there is no question but that the Scottish Office, like all Government Departments, has machinery for scrutinising, and consulting interested parties about, directives and things that are likely to be the subject of directives. No one would pretend that it is perfect: I think no organisation is ever perfect in the sense that it cannot be improved. But I should like to look at the subject of beekeeping in more detail. My information is that perhaps the Scottish Beekeepers Association is worrying unnecessarily because there are exceptions or exemptions that may cover this problem. My hon. Friend and I could perhaps have fruitful discussions about this.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The beekeepers' situation has already been sorted out. What concerns many of us is the machinery for the future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But my hon. Friend raised the specific subject of beekeeping, and I am merely saying that I think some of his fears are unreal. As I understand it, the association has had discussions and is reasonably satisfied, but if there are detailed points I shall follow them up.<br><br>
I would make one comment to my hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Sillars). I am willing to look at any ideas for improving the wages and conditions of farm workers. I do not know—I am of course not giving a commitment here—that this necessarily needs to be tied in with price reviews. It may be that something better can be established. There is machinery, as he knows, and if he has any criticism that it does not function often enough, or that there is something wrong with it, I should be willing to see whether there is substance in his criticisms.<br><br>
My hon. Friend asked a specific question about a joint working party with the milk industry. He has tabled a Question to my right hon. Friend for tomorrow, but I think

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 213</span>
it will breach no parliamentary convention if I tell him now that I have arranged to meet the Milk Marketing Board this week, and shall keep all his points in mind.<br><br>
I should like the hon. Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles (Mr. Steel) to give me more details about baler twine. I shall have investigations made and write to him. I think it is worthy of investigation; though it may not be my direct responsibility, it may be a matter for the consumers' side of the business.<br><br>
To the others who have taken part, 1 would say that I have noted all their points. I was interested to hear the maiden speech on agriculture of my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Queen's Park (Mr. McElhone). I did not think that there were farmers in Queen's Park, any more than there were in the Gorbals, but my hon. Friend will forgive me for that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lawson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are consumers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Discussions are going on about agricultural colleges, and training and education schemes, but I do not have time to go into them now.<br><br>
I note what the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Fairgrieve) said about surpluses for the Third World. This issue raises all sorts of international complications, and I do not think I have time to go into that now.<br><br>
May I finish with the assurance that I gave about the aims and objects of the industry? I can repeat it by quoting the figures to which the hon. Member for Dumfries referred. Since the Government came into office, subsidies for Scottish farmers introduced or reprieved amount to a total of about £15 million. That is not an inconsiderable sum, by any standards. Bearing in mind the consumer's reaction to high beef prices, which was one thing overlooked during this debate, I think I can say that both farmers and consumers can look forward with confidence to the Government taking whatever action is required.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps, Sir Myer, I might be permitted to thank you for chairing these Estimate debates. I have already thanked you personally. I do not think it has been any disadvantage that you have lost your voice this morning, because this has been a reasonably friendly debate, for which I am grateful. May I thank you for the way in which you have handled these proceedings?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I also thank you, Sir Myer, on behalf of the Opposition? You have taken us through all the Estimates with your usual grace and charm. I hope that your voice is better this afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank hon. Members very much. I appreciate the generous remarks they have made. One of the disadvantages of having a croaky voice is that I could not make my customary interventions in the debate as a neutral Chairman.</span></p>
