	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Attorney-General (Mr. S. C. Silkin)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee have considered the draft instrument.</p></blockquote>
That may strike members of the Committee as a somewhat strange form of words, for we are about to carry out the consideration, but as a matter of history it will become appropriate by the time that we make our deicsion. We shall then have considered that that is the form of words incorporated in the new Standing Order 73A which sets up this procedure. I am sure, Mr. English, that you will bear with me if I commit any cardinal error, for this is the first time tat the Law Officers' Department has been involved in this new and useful procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main purpose of the order is to raise the upper limit of the jurisdiction of the county courts from £750 to £1,000 in cases based on tort and contract. The limit of £750 was applied in 1970. Since then, the value of money has fallen by approximately one-third and the new limit will therefore restore the jurisdiction to the 1970 level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That level has been raised at intervals over the years. In the pre-war years, there were three rises only in 93 years. In the post-war period, there have been four rises in less than 30 years—in 1955, 1966, 1970 and now 1974. However, to preserve what I am sure will be the bipartisan approach of the Committee, one may say that politically the rises have been evenly divided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present increase involves some consequential changes. The bar on the recovery of costs on the High Court scale where an action is brought in the High Court that could have been brought in the county court is raised from £500 to £650. The floor on recovery of costs in the High Court goes up from £100 to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
£150. The jurisdiction of county court registrars goes up from £75to £100.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thus it will be seen that the figures do not all rise in exact mathematical parallel with the basic increase. The figures are rounded up or down to avoid inconvenient figures, such as 33·33 recurring, which would otherwise occur. The practical result will be to give litigants a marginally wider latitude in bringing claims in the High Court without risking the loss of High Court costs but at the slightly higher risk of losing all their costs if they bring proceedings in the High Court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give the Committee some detail of the practical effects of the changes. In recent years, the average annual number of writs issued from the Queen's Bench Division claiming between £750 and £1,000 have been about 18,000. As county courts now have an average of one and a half million plaints annually, the addition of 18,000 is relatively minimal. But the matter goes a good deal further than that, because in the Queen's Bench Division only 1½ per cent. of actions commenced are actually tried—a remarkably small proportion, so that on the same basis the actual additional work load of 30 judges sitting in the county court is likely to be negligible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That leads one to consider whether the limit could not safely have been raised still further to, say, £1,500. This was considered and would have found some support among the judges of the county courts, but it was rejected because it would have created complications with costs, that is to say, without fairly substantial changes in the costs structure there would have been overlapping between the High Court and the county court scales at the top end of the county court jurisdiction, and, as hon. Members will appreciate, without a lower scale in the county court than in the High Court the attractions of using the county court would necessarily be reduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will, however, have to be some change in the costs scale to provide for the new band between £750 and £1,000, which is the county court costs scale. That is a change which can be effected by the Rules Committee after this order is approved. But for the High Court scale of costs a very much more comprehensive review would be needed to avoid the difficulty I have mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0623">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
The new limits for registrars will not add significantly to their burdens. The Committee may feel, however, that there is advantage in extending the range of cases which a registrar may refer to himself as arbitrator under the new procedure. That will be one effect of the changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The no-costs limit of £75 in the county court is not directly affected by the order, but that is a matter that the Rules Committee can consider. If it takes the view that that limit should be raised to be in parallel with the new limit of the registrars' jurisdiction, no doubt that will be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been full consultation with the legal profession, the circuit judges who sit in the county court, the registrars and with the under-sheriffs who are marginally concerned, all through their various representative bodies. It is fair to say that there has been some criticism, not of the changes themselves, but of the proposed adjustments to the costs scales. That criticism has come from the Law Society, but, as I have said, there is a limit beyond which county court costs cannot be raised without overlapping High Court costs, this making the increase in jurisdiction counter-productive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite that criticism, both the Law Society and the Bar Council have indicated their acceptance of these adjustunder-sheriffs. Some circuit judges would The changes have been generally accepted by the judges, the registrars and the under-sherics. Some circuit judges would have preferred a rather higher limit for contract and tort cases, but I have explained the difficulties that would be created with ovelapping. Of course, if sufficient desire is shown for a further increase, I have no doubt that my noble Friend will give that full consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order will take effect from 1st October of this year, but proceedings which have already been started in the High Court, or may be started between now and that date, will be unaffected by the various provisions of the order and therefore unaffected as far as costs are concerned. That is probably all I need say in explaining this matter to the Committee at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.41 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Michael Havers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that we are grateful to the right hon. And
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
learned Gentleman for the way in which he has explained the details that give rise to this order. It was delighted with his comments about the powers for arbitration under the Administration of Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act. I had intended to ask whether it extended to that. That has been a very useful addition to the armoury of registrars and county courts and has been working most successfully. It is right that that should be extended, as is the ordinary jurisdiction of the registrar under this order. Certainly my inquiries indicate that there is no particular objection in principle from either the Bar Council or the Law Society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me comment on increasing the limit beyond £1,000. It is important to remember that we must preserve a right of access to a High Court judge in cases where there are issues more important than the amount of damages that may be recovered. Anything which may, by reason of deprivation of costs, penalise that right of access must always be considered with great care. For that reason, I believe that the limits imposed here are probably sensible in the climate in which we now live.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.43 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Weitzman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly approve of the order but I should like to put an observation to the Attorney-General. Paragraph 2 of the transitional provisions of the schedule says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In relation to proceedings begun before 1st October 1974".</p></blockquote>
and certain provisions apply. I have not done my homework and frankly I have forgotten what the position is. However, perhaps the Attorney-General will answer a question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a man began an action two years ago and is awarded a sum of £600, does that mean that he gets county court costs only or, within the discretion of the High Court judge, does he get High Court costs? It seems to me a little unfair when an alteration of this kind is made that that should apply. I may be quite wrong about that, because Section 47 may leave out this provision or deal with it later, but I should like to know the correct position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.44 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Attorney-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, the explanation that I gave
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0624">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
earlier about what will happen applies in the case that my hon. and learned Friend has mentioned. I assume when he speaks about a figure of £600 being awarded that he means after this order takes effect—say, after 1st October—so that the action was brought two years ago, but the judgment is given after 1st October. The position would then be that for that action it will be as though this
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
order had not been passed. Such a person would be in the same position as he knew he would be under the existing provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
