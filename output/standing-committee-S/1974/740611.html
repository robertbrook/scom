	<p>[Sir MYER GALPERN 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>HOUSING (SCOTLAND) BILL</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Teddy Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Myer. One of the difficulties of being Chairman of a Committee is that one gets plagued with points of order which are not always relevant. I should like to put to you four specific points of order which are important and relevant and which affect the whole constitution of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first one arises out of Standing Order No. 62, which reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In nominating a Committee the members of the Committee of Selection shall have regard to the composition of the House."</p></blockquote>
I suggest that there may be a case for the Committee not sitting at all because it does not represent the composition of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As there has been an increase in the number of Liberal and Scottish Nationalist Members of Parliament, my understanding is that at least one of the members of each of those minority parties should be taking part in the proceedings of the Committee. I understand that this matter was considered by the Committee of Selection. To my utter astonishment, I heard through the usual channels that, although a place on the Committee was offered to the Scottish Nationalists and to the Scottish Liberals, both parties declined to take part in the proceedings of the Committee. This is an utterly unprecedented situation. I have never before known an occasion on which a party has been unwilling to take its share of what we know as the donkey work of the House of Commons. We appreciate that the Committee proceedings may be lengthy and complicated, but it is utterly unprecedented that parties represented in the House of Commons should be apparently unwilling to do their share of the work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the first time in my 10 years in the House of Commons we have a Committee which does not reflect the composition of the House, and this raises an important question of principle. I ask you, Sir
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
Myer, what protection the major parties have against action of this sort by minority parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point of order is that one consequence of the Scottish Nationalists and Liberals refusing to play their part in the Committee is that the Opposition have had to provide eight Members to serve on the Committee, which is about 'half our total parliamentary strength. In addition, my hon. Friend the 'Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind) has to serve not only on this Committee but also on Standing Committee C. An unreasonable burden is put on members of the majority parties if they have to fill up places simply because minority parties are not prepared to play their part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I 'have studied the composition of all the Standing Committees which are sitting today. They are the Standing Committees on the Rehabilitation of Offenders Bill, the Trade Union and Labour Relations Bill, the Finance Bill, the Housing Bill and the Housing (Scotland) Bill. Although, if all the Scottish Nationalists and,Liberal Members had been busy serving on other Standing Committees there might have been a case for making a special arrangement, we find that not one Scottish Liberal is serving on a Committee and only one out of the seven Scottish Nationalists, namely, the hon. Member for Aberdeen, East (Mr. Henderson), is serving on the Trade Union and Labour Relations Bill. We are, therefore, being forced to do more of the donkey work simply because the Scottish Nationalist and Scottish Liberal Members are not paying their full part in the work of the House of Commons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My third point of order is that I believe there is justification for you, Sir Myer, as Chairman of the Committee—I hope with the support of all members of the Committee—to make a report to the Services Committee of the House of Commons suggesting a reduction in the salaries of the Scottish Nationalist and Scottish Liberal Members of Parliament if they are not prepared to do the full work involved in serving in the House of Commons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that serving on Committees, which involves detailed deliberations, long sittings and getting up early in the morning, is the main part of our work. It is not glamorous. We shall not get newspaper headlines because of the work we
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0023">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
do here. On the other hand, it is utterly irresponsible and lets down the people of Scotland when two parties, which claim that Scotland is their main interest, are not prepared to serve on the Standing Committee on the Housing (Scotland) Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is concerned with trying to alleviate the problem of slums, improving old tenement properties and setting up housing action areas. The Bill is important and will help the people who live in poor housing conditions in Scotland. I therefore feel that you, Sir Myer, as Chairman, with the support of all members, should make a report to the Services Committee suggesting that the salaries of Scottish Nationalists and Scottish Liberal Members of Parliament should be reduced until such time as they are prepared to play their full part in the work of the House of Commons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My fourth point of order concerns precisely what action we can take as a Committee to protest against the blatant hypocrisy of members of the Scottish Liberal and Scottish National Parties. Last year there was a sit-in by members of the Liberal Party when we discussed the Local Government (Scotland) Bill. We had to explain that, because of the rules of the House of Commons, they could not be guaranteed a place on the Committee. Since then the Liberals and Scottish Nationalists have had electoral success. They have won more seats and they are entitled to a seat on the Committee. On the Second Reading of the Bill there was a demonstration by the Scottish Nationalists objecting to an English Member of Parliament being present. Yet on this major Scottish Bill not one of the seven Scottish Nationalists and not one of the Scottish Liberal Members of Parliament is willing to do his share of the donkey work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have some parliamentary layabouts who are not doing their job. It is utterly wrong, and something should be done about it. We as a Committee should protest but, more important, I suggest that you, Sir Myer, as Chairman of the Committee, responsible to the Speaker of the House of Commons for the management of the affairs of the Committee, should do something about it. It is utterly wrong and shameful that these two parties, which allegedly
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
represent the interests of Scotland, are not prepared to do a share of the work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise to you, Sir Myer, and to the Minister for taking up valuable time. We want to get ahead and discuss Scottish housing, but I feel that this matter is so important that I should put it to you and ask you to give it serious consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point or order—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me deal with one point of order at a time; otherwise we shall get into a complicated maze of points of order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question whether the Committee, or any Committee, gets publicity is not a matter for the Chair. I notice that there are more Press men here this morning than would normally attend a Committee at this stage. I do not know why. The business must be of great importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chairman has certain duties to hon. Members who serve on the Committee, to the House and to the Speaker. His principal duty is to ensure that the members in attendance have been selected by the Committee of Selection and that the business is conducted with the quorum required by the House of Commons. Beyond that, as I am sure the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor) fully appreciates, the selection of members to serve on a Standing Committee is entirely in the hands of the Committee of Selection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An hon. Member who has been selected to serve on a Committee cannot be compelled to serve on it. Having been chosen, he can indicate to the Committee of Selection that he has no desire to serve. Whatever reasons prompt the individual to decline to serve on a Committee is a matter of his own choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cathcart referred to "layabouts". I do not know whether that is a strictly honourable term. It is a matter for the electors to decide when the time comes whether they desire to elect Members who are prepared to discharge their full duties as Members of the House of Commons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that an opportunity was offered to the Liberal Party and to the Scottish National Party to nominate a member to be selected to serve on the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0024">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
Committee, but they have declined to do so. The Chairman has no power to adjourn the Committee or to compel any member of any party to serve on the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having ventilated this matter in the points of order raised by the hon. Member for Cathcart, I think that we should now proceed to deal with the Committee Stage of the Housing Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamish Gray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the points of order. We should perhaps bear in mind that we are in a situation of minority government and that it is irresponsible for minority parties not to play their full part in assisting a minority government in what must inevitably be a difficult time for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been for some considerable time the policy of certain minority parties to represent to the electors that they, and they alone, truly represent the feelings of the people of Scotland. It is significant that in this Committee, which is discussing such an important Bill for Scotland, those people because presumably there is not the same scope for publicity in the day-to-day routine work of a Committee, have not taken up the place which it was signified to them would be made available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that we should proceed. The hon. Member for Ross and Cromarty (Mr. Gray) is fully aware that probably rewards for diligence will come at the appropriate time.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir Myer. I feel that my hon.

Members,vhc represent Scottish constituencies are not willing to play a full part in our deliberations, with the result that the hon. Member for Pentlands has to serve on two Committees. Is there nothing we can do? Can we not at least request that the salaries of those who are not playing a full part should be reduced and extra salary be given to those who have to play a double part?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that I cannot be helpful to the hon. Member for Cathcart. That is not a matter for

	<div class='title'>GENERAL PROVISIONS RELATING TO IMPROVEMENT GRANTS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 1, in page 3, line 7, at end add
	<br><blockquote><p>'(5) It shall further be the duty of local authorities to process and come to a decision on such applications within a reasonable period of time'.</p></blockquote>
This is an important amendment. Clause 2 sets out the general provisions relating to improvement grants. In recent years, largely because of the work of the last Government, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of improvement grants offered to the people of Scotland, and this has made a considerable contribution towards improvement of our housing stock. But there has been a definite difference in the attitudes which local authorities have taken to improvement grants. Some have offered grants to most people who have applied for them, where there were the appropriate qualifications, while others have had a different attitude. There have also been variations in the manner in which the applications have been processed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some cases, because of the ease of administration there has been considerable speed in arriving at decisions on improvement grants, but in other instances
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0025">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
there have been long delays, sometimes because of staffing shortages and sometimes simply because of slow administration. It is a little unfair that the speed with which an improvement grant application is approved depends largely on the local authority area in which the applicant resides.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Bearing in mind that these grants are going ahead, admittedly after 23rd June at a lower level in some areas of Scotland, it is important that we should place a simple duty on local authorities to process and give decisions on such applications "within a reasonable period". It may be alleged that these words are not necessary and that they would not impose any specific obligation on an authority. What is "reasonable"? We know from experience in the House of Commons that the word "reasonable" is in many Acts of Parliament and lays an obligation of a general sort on a local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have received from people who have written to me indications of considerable delays. In recent weeks, but more particularly in recent months, there has been a rush to get improvement grants approved and work completed by 23rd June, the cut-off date for the 75 per cent. grant, and the public have become more acutely aware of the importance of a speedy decision upon their applications. Some applications are simple, while some are complex and have to take longer than others to be considered, but it would be fair and reasonable to put an obligation such as we suggest on local authorities. It may be contended by the Minister that there is no need for it because local authorities act reasonably and give decisions within a reasonable period. But if that is the case, no damage would accrue to local authorities or to people in Scotland by our amendment. I hope that the Minister can agree to it, but if he cannot, I hope he can give an assurance that steps will be taken by him and by the Scottish Development Department to ensure more uniformity of practice and more speed in coming to conclusions on applications.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Mr. Bruce Millan)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the intention of the amendment that local authorities should make decisions on applications as quickly as possible, but I doubt whether the amendment would
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
add anything of value to the Bill from that point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a lack of definition in the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"within a reasonable period of time."</p></blockquote>
I am not sure that in practice one would be able to determine in any particular case, with any certainty which would help the applicant, whether the application had been dealt with within a reasonable period of time. If we were to admit such a defect and put into the Bill something more specific, there would be two difficulties. There would, first, be difficulty in determining the precise period which we should insert in the Bill; secondly, there would be a danger, since we are dealing with what is largely a discretionary system, that, in particular circumstances, by imposing an obligation on the local authority, of the net result being that the local authority might use its discretion not to approve an application whereas in other circumstances, given more time, it would have approved it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would not basically add anything to the Bill and might do more harm than good. Generally speaking, we are not anxious to impose additional obligations on local authorities, particularly in discretionary areas in which we have to rely in other respects on their good judgment. I ask the hon. Gentleman not to press the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we shall encourage local authorities to approve applications within a reasonable period of time. If there is evidence from any area that an authority is not doing so, I will be happy to take it up with the authority. Apart from standard grants and grants in housing action areas, we are dealing with a discretionary system, involving a discretion which rests with the local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for what he has said, particularly for his assurance that if we have evidence of unreasonable variations in the way in which applications are dealt with, he will take the matter up with the local authorities.

The amendment deals with an important matter. The Minister of State said that the improvement grant position is an entirely discretionary arrangement for local authorities, apart from some provisions for standard grants, but it is a little unfair, when we are passing a new law and making millions of pounds available so that people can imrove their homes, that there should be such wide variation in practice between authorities.

Some local authorities have recently taken decisions virtually to put a ban on improvement applications, while others are being more flexible and reasonable in granting them. Clause 3(1) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A local authorty may in any case, other than in respect of an appliction for an improvement grant to which section 7 of this Act applies, refuse to approve an application for an improvement grant on any grounds that seem to them sufficient."</p></blockquote>
Some people consider that it is important to maintain this position because it is one of the real discretionary powers of local authorities and it would be unfair to fetter it, but it is a little unfair that success in obtaining an improvement grant should depend on the area in which the applicant resides. Therefore, instead of leaving a total blanket flexibility for the local authority to refuse or grant an application, we should include the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"on i any grounds that seem to them appropriate n relation to their general responsibility to residents and ratepayers in the area."</p></blockquote>
This would do two things. It would, first, reduce to some degree the total freedom of local authorities to reject improvement grants on grounds which were not sufficient, bearing in mind the housing needs of the community as a whole; secondly, it would prevent any question of discrimination against particular areas. It has been suggested by
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
some people—I am not sure whether it is true—that some local authorities provide grants in some parts of their areas while they are not so agreeable to giving grants in other parts. The amendment would put an obligation on local authorities to use their powers in such a way as not to discriminate against particular areas or people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I drafted the words of the amendment myself, and I appreciate that they may not be totally appropriate legally. But it is important that we should put a general restriction of this sort upon the absolute freedom of local authorities to refuse grants on any ground which appear to them to be sufficient. The grounds should at least be appropriate in relation to the general responsibility of members of local authorities as elected councillors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have here a similar difficulty to that in the earlier amendment, for we are dealing with what is basically a discretionary system. We have to make up our minds whether we wish local authorities to exercise discretion. Later in the clause, we lay down certain conditions in which a local authority will not grant an improvement grant. Those conditions are reasonable because they are directed towards avoiding what could be abuses of the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But when it comes to other cases, if we give discretion to local authorities we have largely to do just that, and there is a limit to the extent to which the Secretary of State can then interfere in legislation or otherwise in limiting that discretion. Apart from that, the amendment is deficient, because all it does is take out the word "sufficient" in line 12 and put in other words which it is not clear to me would substantially alter the meaning of the clause. But the important thing is the discretion given, as I understand it as a layman, in line 11 in the words " … that seem to them …" That is what imports into the subsection the real discretion to the local authority. If we change the word "sufficient" and put in other words, we are still left with the words " … that seem to them …" and those words would seem to give the local authority considerable discretion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that the wording proposed would substantially change the meaning of the clause. If there was strong
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0027">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
feeling that we should attempt to circumscribe the discretion of local authorities in any way—and I am not convinced that we should—I should be willing to consider other wording. But on the whole we have to allow local authorities discretion in this matter. Many local authorities would be extremely aggrieved if we were to limit their discretion in this or in any other way which might be suggested, and I cannot recommend the Committee to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has been understanding and I am grateful for the information he has given. If we have evidence of local authorities appearing to discriminate against particular areas in the giving of improvement grants, will he take the matter up?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not want to give an absolute commitment on that because I would want to know the particular kind of discrimination. It might be a discrimination which, in the circumstances of the authority's case, is perfectly reasonable. The authority may decide, given its other financial commitments, that it wants to give priority to particular types of improvement rather than others, and to concentrate, for example, on areas of particularly bad housing rather than on those in which there are basically reasonable standards of housing. But if I had evidence that authorities were behaving in a way which suggested that we ought to circumscribe their discretion in some way, I would certainly consider it, although the wording involved would probably be very difficult to draft, and I doubt whether it could be done successfully. If evidence is brought to me between now and the Report stage, I will consider it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These amendments, particularly the first one, are to make clear that the maximum approved expense for improvement grant is £2,400, and that the figure includes an amount for any approved expenditure for repair works which come under subsection (3) of the clause. This point was raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Spring-burn (Mr. Buchanan) during Second reading. The hon. Gentleman asked whether the £2,400 included the £800 in subsection (3). It does include that sum. It was not intended that there should be a total of approved expenditure of £3,200. The £2,400 is the total, and amendment No. 4 makes the situation clear.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 5 provides different wording for subsection (3) which I hope will make the provision clearer. I find some difficulty in following the exact convolutions of subsection (3). In regard to repairs, it is intended to provide more liberal provisions where standard amenities are involved. In the 50 per cent. provision was the same in a case involving standard amenities, and, indeed, in other cases, the result would be that where the approved expense was only, say, £100, the amount of repair allowances would also be only £100. The way in which the amendment is drafted allows for the fact

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
that where a standard amenity is to be included, if the sum of £800 is greater than the 50 per cent. of the total of approved expenditure, the £800 will be the limit. The Bill's provisions are rather more generous for houses lacking standard amenities.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a little worried about Amendment No. 4, particularly on the point whether the figure of £2,400 should include any repair grant. I should like to know whether the drafting did not make the intention clear, or whether there has been a change of policy between the Second Reading of the Bill and Committee stage. My understanding of Clause 5 was that the £2,400 was to be considered apart from the £800 and that it would be possible to have a total grant for improvements and repairs exceeding £3,000. Will the Amendment require a change to be made in the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum in terms of its effect on the Bill? Will this result in a reduction of the grants set out in the Bill? Perhaps the Minister could make the situation clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is wholly a question of drafting. I am not even persuaded that the drafting is necessarily defective, but the intention is not as clear as it might be. To put the matter beyond doubt, we have made a drafting change. It was intended all along that the £800 would be comprehended in the overall total of £2,400. So far as I am aware, that also was the intention of the Conservative Government. There has been no change and the Financial and Explanatory Memorandum therefore stands.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to ask one question relating to the ambiguity of the Amendment. The Amendment, when read with the subsection, says that an approved expense for an improvement grant will include:
	<br><blockquote><p>"any amount allowed for the purposes of subsection (3) below …".</p></blockquote>
It goes on to say that such expense will be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
subject to a maximum figure. The words which I find slightly puzzling—and perhaps I am being slightly legalistic—are the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"expense for an improvement grant".</p></blockquote>
They could be ambiguous. I presume that what is meant is expenses for the purpose of determining improvement grant. I hope that the Minister will make the matter clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall consider that point.

During yesterday's proceedings in the House on the Finance Bill reference was made by Ministers to certain undesirable practices in private industry, but unfortunately it must be said that private industry is not alone in these bad practices since
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0029">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
public bodies do not always set a good example in this respect. Local authorities are notoriously bad payers and the sums involved in the payment of improvement grants are not large in terms of a local authority's income and expenditure, but they are enormous sums for the householder.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from the buying of his house, it may be that a householder will never again in his lifetime incur such a large financial liability as when entering into an arrangement to take up an improvement grant. A large financial liability always causes worry. If Amendment No. 6 is accepted, I believe that it will help to protect the householder from any procrastination in the payment of moneys by a local authority and will thus reduce his worries. At the moment there is no guarantee that he will recover this substantial liability and I hope that the Minister will be able to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to say that I can accept the amendment in principle, but not its wording which is defective. I accept the intention of the amendment. Local authorities normally pay grants within a reasonable time, but in some cases there has been undue delay and I shall be happy to include appropriate words in the Clause as drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is defective in its wording because, among other things, the determining period should be the period by reference to the date on which, in the opinion of the local authority, a house first becomes fit for occupation after completion of improvement work.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 7, in page 8, line 42, to leave out subsection (3).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope the Minister will give serious consideration to this Amendment because the matter to which it relates has caused a great deal of worry. It relates to the conditions to be reserved in respect of houses to which an improvement grant has been awarded. Subsection (3) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"it may be a condition of the grant that the house at all times at which it is not occupied by the applicant or by a member of his family will be let or kept available for letting."</p></blockquote>
I can envisage circumstances in which a person will have to leave his house for a period of time after an improvement grant has been given. We appreciate that later in the Bill there is a let-out clause. If somebody finds that he cannot manage the five-year qualification period, then he can pay back the money and nothing is lost, apart from the original grant. On the other hand, it is a little unreasonable that a house in a sound condition should be let at times when members of the family are not occupying it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will know that under previous housing legislation, and particularly under the various rent acts, if a house is let, it is difficult, if not impossible, to regain possession. I wonder whether the Minister has in mind the idea that the house would be made available for letting to an applicant from a local authority housing list, in which case the local authority would accept responsibility for the house. It seems unreasonable that if, for example, I obtain a grant for a house, occupy it for four years, and then go to New Zealand on business for six months,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0030">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
it must be on condition that I have to let the house. If I took that course, then under the provisions relating to security of tenure it would be impossible for me to regain possession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May we be told what the Minister had in mind when introducing subsection (3)? I hope that there is a simple explanation and that the dangers to which I refer are not as relevant as I think they are.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor). There appears to be a danger of confusion following promises made by the Labour Government about security of tenure in furnished lettings, since this provision might eventually make it impossible for somebody to regain possession of a house after it had been let as a result of conditions laid down for the receipt of improvement grant. I am not clear about the situation in regard to security of tenure in a furnished letting in these circumstances. I hope that we shall have an assurance that in no circumstances will somebody be deprived of the use of a house by virtue of housing legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully understand why Clause 9 has been included in the Bill, and there is no disagreement in principle on that point. But legislation covers many situations which are not originally foreseen when legislation is first enacted. The point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor) is very important. I hope that the situation in regard to security of tenure and specific lettings is made clear. There is a great danger that a serious injustice may arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This provision is limited to five years by subsection (1). There have always been conditions about the occupancy of houses improved with the aid of grants. Some of these are set out in subsection (2). Subsection (3) is meant to deal with the case of an owner-occupier who gets a grant and then sells the house for owner-occupation within five years. There may be a perfectly valid and acceptable reason for that sale, such as a change of job for example. In those circumstances, we do not wish to impose an obligation upon him to repay either the whole or part of the grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
On the other hand, there is certainly the possibility—it has happened—of owner-occupiers receiving grants, which are quite substantial, to improve their houses and then selling the improved house, moving on to another property and perhaps doing the same thing again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances, there ought to be a discretionary power given in a local authority to recover all or part of the grant. There is a distinction between subsections (3) and (2), in that (2) is mandatory whereas (3) contains provisions which can be imposed at the discretion of the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will he seen from paragraph (3) of Schedule 2 that the local authority can decide in appropriate cases not to require repayment of the grant. By Amendment No. 8, we shall be seeking to give the Bill a flexibility which will allow a local authority in such circumstances to recover the whole or a proportion of the grant, depending upon how much of the five-year period has elapsed. This is simply a safeguard to prevent what could be an abuse of the scheme. It is likely to be used only in a minority of cases. I do not think that any authority would use it in circumstances in which an owner-occupier, having received the grant, had to leave his home soon afterwards for quite legitimate reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will look at the point raised by the hon. Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Ancram), but I do not see that this provision can have any effect on matters concerning security of tenure in furnished lettings. Subsection (3) has no particular relevance to furnished or unfurnished lettings. It is a provision on its own and related to the circumstances of a sale of a house within five years of the payment of an improvement grant. It is a necessary safeguard against an abuse, such abuse may not occur frequently, but the safeguard should be there. The 1968 Act embodied similar provisions, although not drawn in such flexible terms. Similar provisions will be incorporated in the English legislation. With this explanation, I hope that the hon. Member will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says, that this subsection is to do with the selling of a house, but it seems that that is precisely what it is not to do with. It is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0031">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
to do with the situation when a house is left empty for a time but when the owner is expected to return. The subsection says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"at all times at which it is not occupied by the applicant or by a member of his family".</p></blockquote>
This appears to assume that the applicant will be away and will then return. It is in those circumstances that the danger I spoke of will arise. If it is a furnished house and the occupant leaves it for a time, and if he is bound conditionally to letting the house, he could find himself unable to obtain possession of the house again. I was seeking an assurance that any letting conditional on the grant would in no way endanger the owner-occupier's rights.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There would be no obligation on the individual concerned to let the house in one way or another. There would be certain obligations upon him if the local authority decided to exercise its right and ask him to repay part or the whole of the grant. There would be no obligation upon him not to sell the house but to make it available for letting. The letting provisions will apply to houses let in a variety of circumstances. The legislation would no doubt take into account any house let by an owner in this position. There would be no penalty imposed on an owner and he could always voluntarily repay the improvement grant under Clause 10.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not terribly happy about this. If a house which is the subject of an improvement grant becomes vacant for a period while the family is away, it seems that there could be an obligation to let the house. The Minister is right that the family could, under Clause 10, refuse to let it and repay the improvement grant. But the situation we envisage could arise in some cases, however, and if it does then a family will be in difficulty when it comes to repossessing their house because of the security of tenure provisions in earlier legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need some indication of the kind of cases covered. I live in a small house, but I know that some hon. Members opposite live in large houses. Suppose the hon. Member for Govan (Mr. Selby) wished to convert his house into two houses and asked for an improvement grant of £2,000. Would it be possible for Glasgow Corporation to say to him,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
"You may do that if you wish but only on condition that the second house will be made available for letting." It seems that that could be done. It is an entirely new principle and we ought not to adopt it without being fully aware of the consequences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What, precisely, is a family? I cannot see any definition. Is my cousin part of my family? Is my sister? Is my second cousin from Canada? This is something which could cause real concern. In what circumstances is it envisaged that this provision will operate? The Minister said that it would be very seldom, but if it did operate could the member of the family who has obtained the grant get repossession? My understanding is that he could not in the light of the security of tenure given to furnished and unfurnished lettings. If it happened to me, could I get my house back? My feeling is that I could not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need answers to these points before approving this subsection. In the circumstances, it might be better to take it out of the Bill, let the Minister have a look at it, and then return to it on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot accept that. This provision is intended to prevent what might otherwise be an abuse of the improvement grant scheme. It will concern only a minority of cases and will actually apply in a minority of those cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is given here is a discretion to the local authority to recover part of the improvement grant. This is not unprecedented. There was a similar provision in the 1968 Act which applied automatically to all houses, admittedly for only three years after the improvement grant had been effected. It did not have the discretion and flexibility which we are incorporating here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not most concerned about the case of the owner-occupier who lets the house for a temporary period. We are concerned about the indivdual who sells his owner-occupied house because he wishes to cash in on the improvement grant. If there is a legitimate reason for selling the house, then normally the local authority would not exercise its discretion. If the owner-occupier decides to leave his house temporarily there will be available to him the provisions of the furnished tenancies legislation.

The Rent Bill was read a Second time in another place yesterday. The hon.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
Gentleman will see that there are safeguards in that Bill enabling an owner to obtain possession of a house which he has temporarily let on a furnished basis. These are quite distinct safeguards, applying to a whole range of circumstances. No novelty which attaches particular conditions to a furnished or any other kind of tenancy is introduced by subsection (3), which is intended to do an entirely different job. Those basically are the points which are at issue. This is not unprecedented in previous legislation and the matter has been inserted for a good and sufficient purpose. It is to be hoped that this power will not have to be used very frequently, but in appropriate circumstances it is right that a local authority should have it available to use.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has given us a full answer but I am not entirely satisfied. If the purpose is to stop people getting improvement grants and then selling at a profit, I agree that a local authority should have full powers to claw back the grant. However, I am not at all happy about many unanswered questions. For example, who is a member of the family? How long should be the period of absence? The Bill does not provide that the absence should be, for example, three months, six months or one year. The Clause says "….at all times'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the lengths to which the Minister has gone to satisfy us, but we are not happy. We believe that it would be wiser for the Committee to take out the subsection in the meantime so as to allow the Minister to study the matter with his colleagues and to insert something on Report which is not open to abuse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In all the circumstances, I recommended my hon. Friends to approve the amendment so as to give the Government the opportunity to consider further the point that we have raised. That will enable them to bring forward something that is better and less open to abuse. It is true that reasonable local authorities act reasonably and never create any trouble. However, there is always the possibility, if we frame the law in an incorrect way which places sweeping powers in the hands of local authorities,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
that we shall find that these powers will be open to abuse. In that event we would have only ourselves to blame.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend. I fully accept the Minister's explanation and I think that his intentions are entirely acceptable, but the trouble is that the clause does not only meet the purpose which he intends. That is what is worrying us. We have already envisaged a number of situations which could arise. A further situation which has not been mentioned and on which I would like the Minister's view is if a local authority were always to use this discretionary provision every time to give an improvement grant. I am sure that the Minister would disapprove of that. He has told us that that is not the intention of the clause. However, there is nothing in the Bill which gives any protection against such action by a local authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to go back over the ground that I have already covered. Of course, it is open to a local authority to make certain conditions. The important thing is what will happen when a local authority has the discretionary power to impose a condition and when there is an obligation on the part of the individual to repay the money. I do not believe that local authorities will behave unreasonably in those circumstances. I do not believe that they behave unreasonably in terms of the 1968 legislation. That legislation, of course, was much less conditional than the legislation that we are providing by including these provisions. The 1968 legislation also gave rise to certain difficulties.

I shall recommend to my hon. Friends that the subsection should stay in. If it comes out, the amendments which I shall be moving to Clause 10 and the schedules will be inappropriate and the Government's full intention will not be incorporated in the Bill as it leaves the Committee and will not be explicitly open to consideration by hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The substance of this group of amendments is to be found in Amendment No. 35. In a sense, I am sorry that we have to discuss the matter

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>27</span>
in this order but Amendment No. 8 is consequential on the other amendments to the schedule. The basic amendment in this group is Amendment No. 35.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I previewed to some extent in the discussion of an earlier amendment, we are saying that in the event of a breach of Clause 9(3) we shall deal with the possible sale by an owner-occupier within the five-year period. The local authority may have the discretion either not to recover the grant—that is what paragraph (	<i>a</i>) of Amendment No. 35 says—or to recover the appropriate amount under paragraph (	<i>b</i>). That matter is subsequently defined in Amendment No. 41 on a time basis. The third choice is to recover the grant completely. There is, therefore, complete flexibility in this group of amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments that we are considering with Amendment No. 35 are really consequential. Perhaps I should mention specifically Amendment No. 8. It has to be put into Clause 10, which deals with the voluntary repayment of improvement grants and includes the provision that an owner who breaches the conditions in Clause 9(2) should not be able to avoid repaying the whole of the grant simply by volunteering to repay a proportion of the grant in a voluntary way. Therefore, the voluntary repayment of an improvement grant is confined to the repayment of the whole of the grant. Anyone who breaches or intends to breach the occupancy condition in Clause 9(3) and who wishes to repay voluntarily will not be put at a disadvantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that these complicated provisions, which have a basic purpose of giving more flexibility to the overall position, will be accepted. As I have already said, when they have been inserted in the Bill it will be possible before Report for hon. Members to see how the Government intend the whole matter to operate with the maximum flexibility and with discretion given to the local authority. Hon. Members can then consider whether they wish to try to amend the Bill on Report. If I find that anything that has been said this morning raises a substantial point which is not now covered, I shall make any necessary clarification by way of amendment on Report. I think that I have already made clear the Government's
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
basic intention. We believe that the amendments would properly insert that basic intention properly into the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has given us a perfectly reasonable explanation of these complex amendments. I have only one small point to make about the provisions for voluntary repayment. One provision is that there will be no question of anything but the total sum being paid back under voluntary repayment. I accept that if the person who received the grant wishes unilaterally to get away from the restrictions put in the grant he should pay the full sum. However, I can evisage circumstances in which a local authority would care to waive the conditions. For example, a person may be going to a new job, or somebody may want to get rid of the conditions for various reasons that may fall between the two extremes. In such circumstances would an individual be prevented from putting the proposition to a local authority that because of a change of circumstances the authority might agree to waive the restrictions if three-quarters of the money were paid back?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all accent that circumstances vary from case to case. The last thing in the world that I would want would be an obligation nut on local authorities to accept a lesser sum for voluntary repayment. That would be wrong and not in accord with the provisions of the clause and the amendments that the Minister has introduced. However, if a person who owned a house put a proposition to a local authority that the authority should create in special circumstances an 80 per cent. or 90 per cent. repayment, would that be accepted?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two separate provisions. I am sorry that these matters are not easy to explain. The conditions under Clause 9(2) are mandatory. Clause 9(2)(	<i>b</i>) deals with the second home point. I know that that is a matter which the hon. Member for Ross and Cromarty (Mr. Gray) will be happy to see in the Bill. The conditions must, therefore, apply for the whole of the five-year period. If any of the conditions are broken, the result is that the grant is repayable in full.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>29</span>
Clause 10 and under Schedule 2 the owner-occupier will be in exactly the same position. He will be under no obligation to pay more under Clause 10 than under Schedule 2, or more under Schedule 2 than under Clause 10. Where there is provision for a proportional repayment of the grant, Clause 10 and Schedule 2 will have the same effect, and the owner-occupier will not be at a disadvantage. Where there is provision for complete repayment of the grant because of a breach of the mandatory conditions, the repayment will be of the whole amount. That is a long-standing piece of legislation which goes back to the earlier stage of improvement grants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a minor amendment dealing with Exchequer contributions in respect of repairs and other grants for the most substandard houses. The subsection refers to a grant of 90 per cent., but there might be circumstances in which the Government want to make a contribution in excess of 90 per cent., and I am wondering whether the flexibility suggested in the amendment would be helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millian</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The effect of the amendment would be to allow Exchequer contributions to local authorities in housing action areas to be at a higher rate than 90 per cent. There is considerable difficulty in doing that. The refund to a local authority of 90 per cent. of the cost of improvements in a housing action area is reasonable. To go beyond 90 per cent. and to make the Government responsible for the whole of the cost of the local authority proportion goes further than can be reasonably justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a need to maintain a certain discipline on the local authorities, and to maintain the interest of the local auth-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
orities in seeing that money is spent with due regard to the need to keep public expenditure within reasonable proportions. If we took the amount up to more than 90 per cent., there would be no incentive on the local authority to see that the expenditure was justified in terms of the Bill. Under later provisions of the Clause the Secretary of State may vary the Exchequer contributions, but I suggest that 90 per cent. is as far as one would reasonably wish to go and I cannot, therefore, recommend acceptance of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Clark Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor) said that he could envisage cases where a grant of more than 90 per cent. might be needed. What sort of cases has he in mind?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was simply suggesting more flexibility whereby, in dealing with substandard houses in housing action areas, the Government in special circumstances, if they saw fit, could pay more than 90 per cent. of the cost of improvements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I envisaged certain major cities in Scotland where a major programme could go ahead only at substantial cost to the local ratepayers. Bearing in mind the substantial burden of rates this year and next year in Scotland, the Government might feel that a local authority could go ahead with a substantial housing action programme only at the expense of further putting up the rates. I am not suggesting that more than 90 per cent. should be paid, but that in special circumstances the Government should have the power to pay more than 90 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We often under-estimate the cost of improving old tenements in housing action areas. Our experience in Glasgow shows that the cost which at first sight may appear to be reasonable is, in fact, excessive. I am concerned about the excessive burden of rates in some Scottish cities. However, having had the Minister's explanation, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This is a purely drafting amendment. I do not think I need to give the rather elaborate explanation of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Russell Fairgrieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 11, in page 11, line 38, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'or to any other circumstances which appear to the authority to be relevant'.</p></blockquote>
This is a simple, short amendment which we believe will improve the Bill. As drafted, we feel that subsection (8) is too tight and too narrow. It does not give sufficient scope to the local authority. I know from my experience as a housing convener that circumstances can arise that are not covered by the clause. We are dealing with varying types of houses and with people who have different incomes and cannot be tied down to a simple formula.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We must have regard to what subsection (8) does. It allows local authorities to pay repairs grants. These grants are not related to improvements. They are specifically repairs grants in housing action areas. The provision is a new one and, in the nature of things, it has to be circumscribed, certainly at the beginning to a considerable degree, until we see what is involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an important new principle. I would not like it to be thought that the Government were interested in making indiscriminate repairs grants, even in housing action areas, to people who allowed their property to get into a bad state of repair. A certain element of repairs is allowed in the provision for improvement. That is necessary and desirable, but repairs on their own raise rather different issues. In normal circumstances, one expects an owner-occupier to keep his property in good repair. If he does not, that by itself does not entitle him to financial assistance from local or central government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When one is considering whether to make a repairs grant, the only relevant consideration is whether the owner-occupier can repair his property without undue hardship. I am not clear what other circumstances could justify the giving of public money. It is dangerous to say to an owner-occupier that he need not keep his property in a good state of repair because the local authority, with
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>32</span>
Government assistance, is liable to help him to do so. In a housing action area there is likely to be financial hardship, and one accepts that help is desirable, but the grant must be related to financial hardship, and I cannot see what other circumstances are relevant. For that reason I recommend the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to take up two points in the Minister's reply which still do not satisfy me. There is the question of the ability of the individual to afford the repair. That is governed entirely by the size of the bill for the repair, which may he large or small. That is what worries me. Secondly, the clause does not allow the local authority discrimination.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment. There is no question of our saying that the local authority should be obliged to give money for repairs to people who can afford to pay for them. We are suggesting more flexibility so that if the local authority wishes to make some other provision it can do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister asked what other circumstances come into it. Suppose that people have done everything reasonably possible to have a repair done but have been frustrated by one or two people in the close who will not allow it to proceed. Six or seven people living in a close might wish a repair to go ahead, and one person stops it. Suppose that the one person who does not wish to it go ahead is an old lady of 80 who has saved up £1,000 for her old age. It is unreasonable to give grants to seven people and not to the eighth because that person has saved up a small sum of money. Glasgow tenements are full of elderly people who have saved up a little money which has been eroded by inflation under both Governments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I am not saying that we should go out of our way to force local authorities to give grants to wealthy people, we should allow flexibility for hard cases in the full understanding that the local authority has complete discretion and is not obliged to do anything. A local authority might occasionally come across a case where it is unfair to say that a person who has £500 in the bank should pay, whereas the others should not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a perfectly reasonable request which does not force any local authority to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0037">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>33</span>
do anything. I hope that the Minister will consider this matter between now and Report stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect to the hon. Member for Cathcart, the circumstances which he has just indicated are financial circumstances. He has not mentioned circumstances other than financial circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, as sometimes happens, it is impossible to carry out repairs to a roof, for example, because of the unwillingness or financial hardship of tenants, that sort of case must be examined, but if the repairs have not been carried out because one of the tenants is unable to afford to pay for the repairs, then the repairs grant comes in at the discretion of the local authority at any percentage which the local authority thinks is relevant up to a maximum of 75 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the reason for a particular repair being frustrated is that one tenant in a tenement close is unwilling to pay for it although he is perfectly able to do so, I am not clear on what grounds the local authority should step in and add to the injury to the other tenants by giving money to the unwilling tenant, although he has frustrated the repair for several years, and no doubt added to its cost. If the tenant is not able to afford it, the local authority will step in, but if, for other reasons, the repair has not been carried out, there does not seem to be any reason why the public purse should pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that in a particular tenement property there will be some tenants able to afford repairs, but others for whom the cost of repairs would be a considerable hardship. Some tenants in those circumstances would not like it if they had to pay their share of repairs while the local authority helped those who could not pay. But we do not improve circumstances by saying that the local authority should pay a grant to everybody regardless of whether they can afford it. That would be an unnecessary expenditure of public money in particular circumstances in which there is no improvement to the property at all, but simply a necessary repair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am puzzled to know how a local authority will discover who has enough cash and who does not. What
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>34</span>
are the mechanics of it? How will a local authority find out? There is scope for all sorts of swindles and lies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The simple answer is that, once it is known in such areas that repair grants can be made, the local authority will be open to receive applications for grants. All the subsection says is that a local authority shall have regard—it need not be an overwhelming consideration—to the circumstances of the occupier concerned. If the hon. Gentleman found himself in a housing action area and thought that he had a good chance of getting a local authority to pay for repairs which he had not carried out for a number of years, the local authority would be able to ask, before paying the grant, for some idea of whether the hon. Gentleman was able to pay for it himself. That is a perfectly reasonable position. I am not clear what other circumstances one ought to introduce into this subsection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister of State has misunderstood my point. I do not quarrel with the attitude he is taking. However, when a local authority asks an applicant about his finances, it may not get a true answer. Has it any power to go into it more deeply?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister was asking for circumstances which would not be covered by the present wording. My reading of the wording is that it is the hardship of the applicant, and only the hardship of the applicant, which would be considered. There might be cases—and in my experience they might be fairly numerous—where the applicant would not himself suffer hardship but may have dependants, such as a separated wife and children to whom he makes payments, and he would have to stop making the payments in order to pay for the repairs. That is an example of the sort of circumstances which would be covered by the amendment and which are not covered by the clause at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We understand the Minister's intention, but he is in effect advocating that, if a local authority wishes, it can have regard to the financial situation of the individual. The Minister is, in effect advocating a means test. I am wondering what kind of inquiry should be made. That is also in the mind of my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find that the discussion is becoming slightly bizarre. I thought that hon. Gentlemen opposite, in approaching the whole question of housing finance, were anxious that we should have regard to the means of, for example, council tenants regarding such matters as rent increases. But here, in the case of repairs grants, which might be substantial, they are arguing that we ought to widen the consideration and where there is no financial hardship expend public money. In this case I am coming forward as a defender of the public purse against the extravagance and prolifigacy of hon. Gentlemen opposite, who seem anxious that we should spend large sums of public money unnecessarily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case which the hon. Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Ancram) gave as an illustration is a financial case. In such circumstances, if the payment for the repairs would cause undue hardship, the case would be covered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not covered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is covered by subsection (8).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Getting the details of financial circumstances, raised by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Hutchison), must be left to the good sense of the local authority. If a person applies for a grant, the local authority can expect him to provide whatever substantive information on his financial circumstances it may desire. I do not believe that this new power would be used by local authorities to investigate an individual's financial circumstances beyond the point which would be reasonable. The local authority would simply want to see in a particular case that undue hardship would be unlikely to arise. A typical case may be that of an elderly person on supplementary benefit. It would be wrong to expect that individual, even if he had savings, to pay a large sum for repairs. It would be too much to ask. I have confidence that the local authorities will exercise this additional power with due consideration of all the circumstances. Having had regard to the financial circumstances, if they still want to pay grant, there is nothing to prevent them from doing so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully understood that the hon. Gentleman was on the side of the public purse—he always is. His position is perfectly clear, but I am rather puzzled about the position of some of his hon. Friends. The answer to his point is, "yes", because this is a discretionary grant and therefore a local authority need not pay it at all. Thus, the incentive is with the applicant to demonstrate to the local authority that he has a good case, and that, rather than elaborate provisions for the local authority to get information, is the appropriate safeguard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the hon. Gentleman is in danger of seeing ogres under the bed which do not exist. I was genuinely seeking clarification and not making an issue of the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 12, in page 11, line 39, at beginning insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'Subject to the provisions of subsection (5) above'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this amendment it will be convenient to consider Government Amendments Nos. 13 and 14.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the amendment will be some comfort to hon. Gentlemen opposite because the effect will be to enable local authorities to give grants in cases of financial hardship at 90 per cent. instead of 75 per cent. for repairs as well as improvement grants. It would seem to be a sensible provision. One ought to have the same kind of percentages here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of Amendment No. 13 is to disapply the requirement on a local authority in Clause 5(5) to deduct from an improvement grant any previous grant made in respect of works to the house in considering whether to give a repairs grant. The repairs grant will be given only, as I have already made clear at

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>37</span>
some length, in cases of financial hardship. Therefore, we do not need to apply any additional constraint to it, and the amendment removes that additional constraint.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 14 enables subsections (3), (4) and (5) of the clause to be applied to repairs grants as well as to improvement grants. The purpose is clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>No. 14, in page 11, line 45, after 'Act', insert:

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 15, in page 11, line 46, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(11) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, a local authority may provide assistance towards the cost of house repairs outside housing action areas subject to each such grant being approved by the Secretary of State '.</p></blockquote>
The purpose of the amendment is to prevent the. Bill, so far as repairs are concerned, from being restricted to houses in housing action areas. During Second reading, many hon. Members were disturbed about difficulties which may be encountered in setting up housing action areas, because this may exclude certain conditions of housing. It is accepted generally by the Committee that these housing action areas are likely to be small, and the effect of the amendment is merely to try to ensure that nothing in the Bill will prevent isolated houses, where there are bad and intolerable conditions, from being eligible for application to be made to the local authority for assistance towards the cost of repairs. During Second reading, the Secretary of State proclaimed the Bill as an attack on "slumdom" but it would be unfortunate if the Bill attacked " slumdom " only in blocks rather than wherever it exists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment in the spirit in which it is offered and thus ensure that, where there are bad conditions and repairs are required outside housing action areas, it will be possible, at the discretion of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>38</span>
Secretary of State, to allow a grant to be given.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that I cannot recommend the Committee to accept the amendment. We are introducing a new and unprecedented measure of help in the form of the repairs grant. We must, at least at this stage, confine this to the housing action areas which are by definition the areas which a local authority feels to be most in need of renovation and improvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not for a moment disputing that there will be cases outside housing action areas of houses needing repair. Perhaps there will also be cases where, if one was simply looking at the circumstances of the owners, one would see that financial assistance would be justified, at least in the sense that it would be as justified as what is likely to happen in some cases within the housing action areas. Nevertheless, in introducing a new provision we must have regard for public expenditure and for priorities. The priority must be for repairs grants to be given within housing action areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think this point is seriously disputed on either side of the Committee. Indeed, the amendment limits the discretion provided for a local authority to give assistance outside a housing action area by saying that the grants in each case would have to be approved by the Secretary of State. Apart from the matter of principle, we believe that if the terms of the amendment were used on a substantial scale, it would be administratively impossible for the Secretary of State to administer without imposing an insufferable burden on the Civil Service or building up a large staff to deal with the provision. We believe that this would not be justified in the present context of legislation and public expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that when these repair grants have been operating for a number of years, we might wish to consider extending them outside housing action areas. I make no commitment on that matter and express no opinion one way or the other as to whether that would be a desirable priority to follow, but at the moment the priority must be to deal with the housing action areas. For these reasons, I ask the Committee not to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>39</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend put his case very clearly. We accept that the Government must observe priorities in housing. We also appreciate that the amount of money available at present is limited and therefore that the number of housing action areas will probably be small. But things may improve and more money may become available generally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that at some time in the future it may be possible to consider extending these facilities outside the housing action areas. But if ever this happens we shall need new legislation. Therefore, would it not be sensible for the Government to have some provision by which in, say, three or four years' time the then Government will then be able to consider extending the grant outside housing action areas? It is a little foolish to miss this opportunity of taking some action in this Bill rather than to have to introduce new legislation on a future occasion. Would it not be sensible to make a start on the matter now? It may be that in three or four years' time, under a Conservative Government with the extra prosperity that will bring, and also with the added prosperity which by then will flow from the oilfields, we may wish to take advantage of such a provision. Although I hope my hon. Friend will not pursue his Amendment to a Division, I hope that the Minister will give an assurance that he will take power to do something about this matter at some time in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having laboured through this Bill, any proposition which suggests that we should avoid something similar in future evokes a sympathetic response from me. But the proposition advanced by the hon. Gentleman is not the proposition that is contained in the amendment. If another amendment were tabled, I should consider it on its merits, but we are not dealing with such an amendment now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no shortage of housing legislation. We seem to have a Housing Bill every year. If any future Government decides to take some steps on the lines suggested, when the oil revenues may by then begin to flow, then I am sure that there will be no difficulty in their obtaining some legislative vehicle to include that provision. Housing Bills tend to appear with great regularity. However, these other considerations are in a way
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>40</span>
irrelevant to the matter with which we are now dealing. The present amendment is one which I cannot recommend the Committee to accept.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed by the Minister's reaction to the amendment. I feel that many of my constituents, and indeed constituents throughout the country, will suffer if the amendment is not accepted. People in rural areas may be just as much affected as are those who live in areas of greater population. People living in isolated houses in rural districts will be excluded from the benefits which those living in more populated areas will be able to obtain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, in view of the Minister's reply, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment, but give the warning that we shall table a different amendment on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This is an extraordinary motion to move in this Committee, but we have made extremely good progress this morning. Before we adjourned for Whitsun, I discussed the Bill's progress with the hon. Member for Cathcart, and we agreed that if we reached the end of Part I this morning, that would be a reasonable target and would enable hon. Members to consider further clauses so that they could, if necessary, table amendments in good time. We have done very well; I am happy with progress, and I hope that the motion will be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very grateful for the motion and have pleasure in supporting it. The Minister could take a lesson from these proceedings. It is my experience that if a Minister is reasonable in considering amendments, then a Committee can make rapid progress. If, on the other hand, a Committee does not receive understanding and assurances on various points, then its proceedings can take a long time. I think that we have improved the Bill and I believe that we shall continue to do so in later stages.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I associate myself with the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor). I suggest that when the Minister reports to the Secretary of State on the proceedings in this Committee, he should point to the responsible and constructive opposition which has taken place on this side of the Committee. Proceedings in the past in Scottish Standing Committee have not always seen this kind of approach. I hope that the Secretary of State will be apprised of what has happened on this occasion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>42</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I gladly undertake to do that. It is an unusual situation, and when I report to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State I shall have to do so with a certain amount of caution in case the shock of such news causes any kind of mental disturbance. I shall let him know that precedents can be set in Scottish Committees and will inform him that we have dealt with 12 Clauses in a period of two hours. I shall be delighted to try to facilitate the proceedings on this Bill in subsequent Sittings and elsewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
