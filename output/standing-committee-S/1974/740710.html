DRAFT NATIONAL RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION BOARD (EXTENSION OF FUNCTIONS) ORDER 1974</div> <!-- legislation -->

<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Health and Social Security (Dr. David Owen)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee have considered the draft instrument.</p></blockquote>
This is a simple order. The National Radiological Protection Board was set up under the Radiological Protection Act 1970 to undertake functions concerning the protection of mankind from the hazards of ionizing radiations. At the time it was considered that it might be necessary to extend the remit of the board to cover the potential hazards from nonionizing electro-magnetic radiations such as microwaves and lasers. Accordingly, Section l(16)(<i>a</i>) of the Act gave the Secretary of State the power, after consultation with the Atomic Energy Authority and the Medical Research Council, to make an order—subject to the affirmative resolution procedure—to extend the terms of reference of the board and of the Statutory Advisory Committee appointed under Section 4 of the Act to cover the dangers arising from the use of non-ionizing electro-magnetic radiations.<br><br>
In view of the increasing use of lasers and microwaves, and other forms of non-ionizing electro-magnetic radiations, and of the national and international moves to ensure their safe use, the time has come to extend the board's terms of reference to cover this group of radiations. The order is limited only to this widening of the board's remit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timothy Raison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We on this side of the Committee are satisfied that this order is necessary. I have read some lurid accounts of the kind of things that may arise from this form of radiation and it

is entirely appropriate that the order should be made.</span></p>

DRAFT SCOTTISH SPECIAL HOUSING ASSOCIATION (LIMIT OF ADVANCES) (SCOTLAND) ORDER 1974</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>10.34 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Mr. Bruce Millan)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee have considered the draft instrument.</p></blockquote>
The purpose of this order is straightforward. It is to increase to £290 million the limit of the aggregate amount of advances which may be made by the Secretary of State out of the National Loans Fund to the SSHA to finance its operations in providing houses for rental.<br><br>
The statutory limit on these advances was first set in 1955 at £75 million and it has been raised from time to time by subsequent legislation. In terms of the Housing (Amendment) (Scotland) Act 1970 it now stands at £230 million with provision for increase to £290 million by order of the Secretary of State.<br><br>
The total of advances made to the SSHA at the end of the 1973–74 financial year was £199 million, since when further advances of £4 million have been made. The association also has firm building commitments, against which no advances have yet been made, amounting to £22 million. In addition, it has a future programme of new building and improvements authorised in principle, for which detailed costs are not yet approved, which will amount to well over £150 million at today's prices. It is clear therefore, that the present limit of £230 million will be reached by about the middle of 1975, and it seems prudent to make an early approach to the House for an increase in the authorised limits.<br><br>
The activities of the Scottish Special Housing Association are well known to members—at least to the Scottish members—of this Committee. It has a very wide remit. Rather than attempt at this point to deal with that in any detail, I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0566">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
prefer to make one or two brief observations about what the association is doing. If hon. Members have particular points of information or argument to put to me about the SSHA, naturally, I shall be glad to try to catch the eye of the Chair again to answer them.<br><br>
The association has already provided about 80,000 houses throughout Scotland, and it has thus made a major contribution to meeting public sector housing needs. It is now heavily engaged in providing essential infrastructure for the areas of Scotland where economic expansion is taking place. Since 1966 the role of the SSHA has basically been to provide in areas of economic expansion for incoming workers and also for Glasgow overspill. It has a programme at present of some 17,000 houses for completion over the next four or five years, and 4.600 of these are to be built in the areas of oil development around Aberdeen, the Moray Firth and in Shetland. These houses are intended primarily to meet the needs of incoming industrial workers in areas where economic expansion is stretching the resources of local authorities or where special overspill agreements have been concluded.<br><br>
It is my impression in visiting those areas that the help which the local authorities obtain from the SSHA in this respect is very welcome. Indeed, the association's building programme is vital to the development of those areas, to bringing labour into the areas, and to seeing it satisfactorily housed. We have told the local authorities in these areas that we shall give them every assistance in providing the houses and other infrastructure developments which are needed to provide for oil development or economic expansion. We and our predecessors have therefore authorised a considerable programme for the SSHA.<br><br>
That is only one important part of the work which the SSHA is doing at present. It is for that reason that this additional money is required now, and I am sure that the Committee will be happy to allow this money to be made available to the SSHA in view of its record over the years since its inception. I shall be glad to take up any detailed points about the Association's activities when I wind up later.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
<p>10.38 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Teddy Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Sir Myer, I am sure that the whole Committee will join me in hoping that your voice, which was under considerable strain yesterday, is continuing to improve. We appreciate the considerable burden imposed upon you in being Chairman of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful—as long as hon. Members do not take advantage of my croaking.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I certainly shall not.<br><br>
It is common knowledge in the Committee and the House that the Opposition have a very high regard for the Scottish Special Housing Association. We should have no objection to increasing its borrowing powers by £60 million so long as the association continues to follow the sensible and constructive policies pursued under the previous administration.<br><br>
I have six specific questions which I hope the Minister will be able to comment on and which will give us a lead on whether the previous policies are being pursued.<br><br>
The first question relates to the housing programme of the SSHA. We are aware that the SSHA has made a very considerable contribution to satisfying Scotland's housing needs, and in his opening speech the Minister kindly recognised that the previous Government had authorised a considerable housing programme for the SSHA.<br><br>
On the other hand, in the Queen's Speech, reference was made to the alarming and dramatic fall in house building and it was indicated that the present Government would take immediate steps to change the situation and accelerate the housing programme. We have not seen any sign of that so far. Do the Government intend to extend the building programme of the SSHA on top of what was planned by the previous Government?<br><br>
The second question relates to the particular problems of the North-East. It appears that the major oil developments in the North-East are creating an acute housing problem—we have had many reports of this—and the SSHA is one of the organisations which will make a considerable contribution to solving it. Some areas in the North-East are extremely concerned about the rating burden which will
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0567">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
fall on their authorities through having to provide all the facilities for expansion for the oil programme. Is the Minister satisfied that the contribution to be made by the SSHA will be adequate to cope with expansion of the oil industry?<br><br>
The third question relates to the rents charged by the Scottish Special Housing Association. The Government imposed a freeze on rents as from 8th March which applied to the SSHA as well as local government and the majority of private rented housing. As the association is in fact being given £60 million additional borrowing powers, what will be the policy on rents after 31st December? Clearly this is very important to the accounts of the SSHA and its ability to balance its books.<br><br>
It would also be helpful if the Minister could indicate that it is his long-term idea that rents for SSHA and comparable local government houses should be at the same level. I am sure that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Queen's Park (Mr. McElhone), who has now unfortunately taken from me the Toryglen area of Glasgow which used to be in the Cathcart constituency, will confirm that over the years there has been some concern about variations between SSHA and local authority rents when the tenants come from the same housing list. Is it the Minister's long-term intention that throughout Scotland SSHA and comparable local authority housing will have comparable rents?<br><br>
The fourth question relates to the sale of houses. I am very alarmed that last night apparently a Written Answer was given—unfortunately, we do not have HANSARD to check this—which seems a most inappropriate way of announcing this, in answer to a Question from the hon. Member for Glasgow, Queen's Park saying that there was to be a considerable change in the policy on the sale of local authority houses. I have not seen the details of the answer, but I think it referred only to local authorities. It is unfortunate that it seems that not only are the Government holding back considerably the sale of council houses to sitting tenants who want to purchase them but that there is a considerable change in the sale policy.<br><br>
We on this side of the Committee have always wanted to encourage owner-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
occupation. To that end, we introduced a scheme whereby local authorities could, if they so desired, offer houses for sale to sitting tenants at discount prices on the market value. I believe we authorised discounts of up to 20 per cent., which obviously was a considerable incentive to people to buy their homes, although there could be restrictions on the sale of the houses for a period of five years.<br><br>
What is to be the policy on sales to sitting tenants within the SSHA? I have received letters from SSHA tenants who want to buy their own homes and who apparently are being prevented from doing so. As the Minister has more direct control over the SSHA than over local authorities, can he say what is to be the policy on the sale of houses to sitting tenants?<br><br>
The fifth question relates to what I regard as the splendid work by the SSHA in regard to the improvement of areas. In the recent debate in the Scottish Grand Committee on housing in Scotland, it was interesting to note that instead of concentrating on house building or letting policies, almost every speech concentrated on the problems of the large housing schemes.<br><br>
There was a general view that many of these housing schemes could deteriorate further to become the slum areas of tomorrow. The whole Committee united in saying we had to do something to improve the general standards of amenities and, so far as we could, to make sure that vandalism was curbed in these areas.<br><br>
Looking at some of the SSHA areas, in particular Toryglen, now represented by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Queen's Park, I have been very impressed by the amount which is being spent, and by the effort being expended in improving the general appearance and amenity of these areas by providing trees and garden areas within the schemes instead of open bits of ground covered with wild grass. Nothing is more disturbing in housing areas than to see open spaces covered with litter and totally unkept in garden amenity.<br><br>
It appears to me that the SSHA has been taking the lead in this effort, not just in Glasgow but in other areas. Could the Minister give us an assurance that that policy will continue? It is strange that we have the SSHA in some cities
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0568">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
getting its tenants from the same housing list as the local authority, yet SSHA houses are more popular. One of the reasons is the way in which the association tries to maintain the amenities of the area.<br><br>
My last question relates to some of the problems in which the SSHA has previously taken a lead. Has thought been given to the possibility of the SSHA acting not just as a house building agency but also as a kind of research or brain bank to help local authorities to overcome some of their maintenance problems? For example, was thought given to the SSHA carrying out a major part of the work of improvement under the Housing (Scotland) Act which we recently discussed in Standing Committee?<br><br>
What worries me is that within municipal housing areas we have chronic problems of maintenance, and all the endeavours of local authorities do not seem to overcome them. For example, there is the problem of dampness in some local authority housing schemes. Every Member of Parliament who has local authority tenants in post-war houses knows that in many areas there are appalling dampness problems. Time and time again my constituents have written to me. I have written to the local authorities. They have stated that the problem is largely one of ventilation. People keep their windows open, and still the dampness appears in the walls. I have been in houses where there has been green mould on the walls, and mould on clothing. Despite all the efforts of the tenants to keep the windows open and co-operate with all the advice of the local authority, dampness is a major problem in some of these areas.<br><br>
Could the Government think of using the SSHA for a research operation to help local authorities in overcoming some of these acute problems? It is outrageous that tenants have to live in some of the conditions in the new housing areas which have dampness and other problems. Something must be done, and I wonder whether SSHA could be used for a research operation.<br><br>
There are problems in multi-storey flats. Some of my constituents have constant difficulties with lifts breaking down, not just because of lack of maintenance but often because of vandalism. Sometimes the control panels are ripped out. Could
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
the SSHA give a lead in producing better vandal-proof lifts? Could it act as a practical research body to give advice to local authorities to help overcome some of the problems which they are facing in their endeavour to maintain their property and often decent living conditions to their tenants?<br><br>
I hope that the Minister can answer these detailed questions. Certainly, on this side of the Committee we think that the SSHA has made a major contribution to Scottish housing, and we hope that it will continue to do so.</span></p>
<p>10.49 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Frank MeElhone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor). He drew our attention to some new problems, in particular, dampness, suffered by the Scottish Special Housing Association. One can go into a house and see green mould on the walls and be told by a local inspector that it is just condensation, and that if people keep their windows open it will disappear. It does not disappear. It causes a great deal of hardship and annoyance to tenants.<br><br>
I take the hon. Gentleman's point that the SSHA could well be an agency for research and development in housing standards. It could certainly help to eradicate a problem that is not uncommon and which has had a significant effect on families and older people, who blame their ill health on the dampness—or condensation as it is called in SSHA houses.<br><br>
I should like the Minister seriously to consider suspending this order at present, thereby not approving the £60 million. I am disturbed at the standard of management within the SSHA. I could have brought countless letters to the Committee, and I have no doubt that my hon. Friends can substantiate what I am saying. I have had correspondence with the present Chairman, Mr. Gordon Muir, and also with the previous chairman. The present chairman was a former Conservative housing convenor in Glasgow, and the previous chairman was a Labour housing convenor, so this is not a party matter. I cast a plague on both houses in that respect.<br><br>
I should make two specific points. The first concerns lifts in multi-storey blocks. I have had numerous meetings with a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0569">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
tenants' association in my area, representing 2,000 houses, 500 of them in multi-storey blocks. They are an extremely responsible group of people, and I pay the highest tribute to them.<br><br>
I have had meetings with the management of Glasgow Lifts, and the tenants have had meetings with the management. I should not like to say how many times the SSHA has had meetings with the management—at chairman level—of Glasgow Lifts. The maintenance contract has been broken time after time. There was a confrontation recently with the local lift engineer, and he was slightly attacked because of the exasperation of the tenants. The union blacked the lifts for a period, and I eventually had to act as a mediator in an attempt to get the matter sorted out. This is the degree of antagonism that has been reached in the Hutchesontown area.<br><br>
The lifts are out of action on average, two days a week. I have spoken personally to the chairman on the telephone, and I have met him in London. He agrees that the lifts need a great deal of maintenance and renovation. However, he expressed concern in a letter that this might not be approved by the Scottish Office because of restrictions on capital expenditure. The contents of that letter covered both Conservative and Labour periods of office. As a result of the management's vacillation it is no exaggeration to say that, with the number of elderly people who live in these blocks, there could be a fatality. If someone is locked in a lift for between one and six hours, as has happened in the past, there could be a serious situation. We have received all the co-operation one could wish for from the tenants' association, a model tenants' association for any SSHA group in Scotland.<br><br>
The second element of irritation concerns television aerials in multi-storey blocks. Glasgow Corporation has reached an arrangement with the contractor who installed and maintains the television aerials whereby the tenant will not be charged. For the benefit of hon. Members, I should explain that at one end of a multi-storey block one often does not receive a television picture unless one has a piped-in television aerial. The cost attendant upon this service—it is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
a particular problem for old-age pensioners—qualifies for no alleviation under the supplementary benefit scheme. People find that they have to pay a charge year after year for this as SSHA tenants, which they would not have to pay as council tenants.<br><br>
May I again highlight the exasperation of people in my area? It is a large development area, and people have been decanted from the old tenements. Often, they do not have a choice whether they have an SSHA house or a council house. People tell me—I do not say in every case, but often—that because of the pace of building they find that the only choice they have, unless they sit until the buildings actually come down on top of them, is to take an SSHA house.<br><br>
I say this to the Minister—he is a Glasgow Member of Parliament and is probably aware of what I say—that the choice, if I were being moved under redevelopment, would be for the local authority in Glasgow and certainly not as an SSHA tenant. There is a long history of bad relationships with the council of management of the SSHA, and, before it is allowed any other finance—the £60 million the Minister has mentioned this morning—an investigation into it must take place at Scottish Office level. I know that we are only discussing the order and will not be voting on it. However. I feel so strongly about this matter that, if there were a vote this morning, I should be prepared to divide the Committee.<br><br>
Would the Minister be prepared to recommend that a tenant or a member of a tenants' association should serve on the council of management? This would help better relationships between tenants, tenants' associations and the council of management. It would reduce the volume of correspondence I have with the tenants' association, apart from the number of meetings that I have, and with the council of management in Edinburgh.<br><br>
May I touch on my Question, which was referred to by the hon. Member for Cathcart, regarding the sale of council houses, or SSHA houses for that matter? Most of the people to whom I have spoken do not wish to see the sale of any SSHA or local authority housing. However, the Written Answer speaks about individual control with respect to SSHA housing. Perhaps the Minister would refer to that in his reply. I also
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0570">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
hope, in common with the hon. Member for Cathcart, that the rents of SSHA houses at least should be comparable with those of the local authority. That was another bone of contention, that all too often over the past few years a person found himself paying a higher rent than, perhaps, for a council house just across the street.<br><br>
These might seem trivial matters in the context of £60 million for extra development. I accept the genuine need to build more houses in the North-East of Scotland because of the oil boom. There is a good record of house building with which I can credit the SSHA. But nevertheless I am voicing, as a Member of Parliament must, the sheer aggravation of people who look after 2,000 tenants in the Hutchesontown area of the Gorbals, and the degree of aggravation in the Toryglen area, which the hon. Member for Cathcart passed on to me—for which I am grateful—with regard to dampness and other matters.<br><br>
We shall accept the order because we are not allowed to vote upon it, but I should like some assurance that an investigation will be made into the council of management and into the number of letters I have had with it on the question of lifts, and that the question of lifts in the Hutchesontown area will be dealt with speedily. I am not exaggerating when I say that there could be a fatality because of the continual breakdown of the lifts, the bad maintenance, the continual breaking of the maintenance contract and the same firm carrying out the alleged maintenance work week after week.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Cathcart referred to vandalism. I should be the first to say that my area is not without vandalism. However, when building started in the Gorbals after the Second World War, there was a feeling abroad that! the building of houses would lead to people abusing them. There was cynical talk about putting coal in baths because people did not use them. Anyone who visits that area will see a model housing estate as far as one can expect in present day terms. The vandalism is minimal, because of the attention devoted by this very strong and active tenants' association, the members of which give much of their own private time. This asso-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
ciation is not to be discouraged and is not to break up.<br><br>
The Minister must act speedily and I hope he will give me assurances which I can pass on to the tenants in the near future. I hope the points I have made will be shortly be taken care of, and I have no doubt that, on amendment, this side of the House will voice the same apprehension.</span></p>
<p>11.0 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Reid</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Since its inception the SSHA has done a good job for Scottish housing. The provision of 80,000 Scots houses has gone a long way to meeting part of the housing needs in Scotland. Clearly, in view of the forward plans of the SSHA for another 17,000 houses—4,000 to 5,000 in the oil areas—it would be churlish to quibble about the provision of a further £60 million.<br><br>
We have to relate these figures to the total housing need in Scotland. We still have in Scotland some of the worst housing perhaps in the whole of Western Europe. There are approximately 220,000 houses unsuited to human habitation, with men, women and children still living in them. That should be borne in mind when considering this matter.<br><br>
Secondly, there is the point about rents already touched on by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor). I have often found in my constituency a fair amount of aggravation and irritation resulting from the difference between SSHA and local authority rents. Perhaps the Minister could indicate whether at some point in future he sees the two rent levels being equalised.<br><br>
Thirdly, a brief word about improvement schemes in Scotland. Some of the SSHA schemes built in Scotland in the 1950s were designwise—I repeat designwise—as bad as anything to be found this side of the Iron Curtain. In many parts of Scotland Stalinist blocks were erected and now a vast amount of money has to be spent on them for basic improvement schemes. Some of the back greens, especially in West Scotland, are overgrown with grass and covered with rubbish. A great deal of money is now having to be spent merely to bring them up to a reasonable standard. Clearly that will be a continuing need unless many of the houses built by the SSHA are to become, as one hon. Member said, the slums of tomorrow.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0571">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
Moving on to standards of design today, it is fair to say that in Scotland current SSHA design, especially in high-density, low-rise housing, is better than anything being built for the same price in the private sector. I state that for the record.<br><br>
Condensation, to which various hon. Members have referred, is one of the most common problems which any Scots Member has to deal with. In Tullibody steel-framed houses have large blisters forming on the walls and the only advice we have had from the SSHA is to keep the windows open and the fires on. In these days of financial stringency that is difficult advice for many people.<br><br>
Lastly, I will deal with the problem of the single person. In many areas of Scotland. especially in the growth areas, there is the nurse, the teacher, and the young executive coming in who does not want a complete house. A bed-sit would be sufficient. It may be that in future we will have to look to the SSHA to provide accommodation for such people. It is remarkably difficult to find suitable accommodation for them in the private market and there is very little in the public sphere.<br><br>
Having made those points, I agree with the Minister that it would be " prudent " to sanction the extra £60 million. However. I take the point of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Queen's Park (Mr. McElhone) concerning democracy. It would be extremely useful in future to have a tenant on the Council of Management. That would be in the interest of everyone concerned with housing in Scotland. With the reservations I have made, I agree to the £60 million.</span></p>
<p>11.3 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. J. M. Craigen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have three substantial SSHA schemes in my constituency and there are four points on which I should like the Minister's assurance.<br><br>
First, I support the call made by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Queen's Park (Mr. McElhone) regarding tenant participation on the non-elected council of management. My experience of SSHA tenants' associations has been very good and I have found them extremely constructive. I hope that the Minister will look at this question.<br><br>
In respect of piped-in TV aerials, I can assure my hon. Friend that the Wynd-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
ford Tenants' Association has taken this matter up frequently with the Council of Management of the association but it has had rather unsatisfactory replies. I hope that the Minister will interest himself in this.<br><br>
I welcome the start which the association is making on environmental improvements to the Cadder scheme. I believe that the tendering for phase one of this scheme begins in September, but can the Minister indicate when he hopes the overall scheme of environmental improvement for Cadder to be completed?<br><br>
Lastly, the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor) raised an interesting point about the association being used as a research agency. I wonder what the building research station is doing in this field, because the SSHA has often been the body responsible for building multi-storey blocks in which the tenants have complained to me about dampness. Perhaps we should make more use of existing research agencies within the building field, rather than look to an association which itself is sometimes guilty in this respect.<br><br>
I support the SSHA's request for an additional £60 million, and I hope that the Minister will give some guarantees on the points that I have raised.</span></p>
<p>11.5 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tom McMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to raise one point. I have dealt with housing matters for 20 years. In the Strathclyde Region and the Glasgow District Council area there will be a great deal of rezoning. This means that in the Cambuslang and Rutherglen areas there will be industrial estates, while in my area there will be empty fields with no building going on at all. The best thing that could happen would be for Scottish special housing to come into Glasgow Central. These areas which will be empty for years should be filled now. The biggest problem facing the Glasgow district is that of rezoning. I hope that the Minister will consider that.</span></p>
<p>11.7 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Selby</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Many of the points which I was going to raise have been covered by other speakers. However, I hope that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor) will lose his sanguinity about the unfreezing of rents.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0572">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
I hope that rents will continue to be frozen.<br><br>
I must compliment the SSHA, because it builds very good houses, but there must be a place here for democracy. I am all in favour of the democratic control of housing, but I do not believe that appointing one individual from a tenants' association to a board is demorcacy. I believe that once the good houses are built they should be handed over to the local authorities to administer.<br><br>
Most of the complaints that I have received about SSHA houses have arisen from rent increases. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart did not refer to the situation which obtained under one chairman of the association. One of the snags was that he wore two hats. He raised the rents of SSHA houses, but kept the rents of Glasgow Corporation houses at the level which we regarded as being more in line with Socialist policy.<br><br>
I hope that when we consider giving further money to the housing association we shall take into account democratic principles and decide that once the houses are built they should be handed over to the local authorities.</span></p>
<p>11.9 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to try to answer some of the questions which have been raised by hon. Gentlemen.<br><br>
First, the hon. Gentleman the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor) asked whether the housing programme which the previous Government had authorised for the SSHA would be maintained or expanded. I am glad to say that in the last few months we have approved quite appreciable new housing for the SSHA and I would certainly hope that over the next few years we shall have very much better rates of completion of houses by the SSHA than those achieved—if that is the word—by the last Government.<br><br>
May I draw attention to the figures? It was a rising programme under the Labour Government: in 1968 the number of completions was 2,048; in 1969 this rose to 2,779 and in 1970 to 3,525. Then the rot set in: 1971, 3,058; 1972,1,739; 1973,1,328; and first quarter of 1974, 197. That is not the kind of record anyone would want to boast about, and I would certainly envisage, indeed pledge, that the figures over the next few years
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
will show a very considerable improvement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman did not indicate the figures for starts in 1973 and whether he thinks that starts in 1974 will be more.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I certainly do, but may I give the figure for starts in 1973 compared with 1970: in 1970, 3,243; in 1973, 1,674. I am afraid we have picked up a fairly dismal situation from the previous Government, though I agree that the intention to build up the SSHA activities in the areas of oil development is a very welcome development and we intend to see that the SSHA makes a major contribution there.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked whether the contribution would be adequate in the North-East. In a sense, we have to see how the programme turns out there, but the SSHA effort there is part of a bigger effort by local authorities as well. The intention has been to use all the agencies, the local authorities and the SSHA, on a basis which would provide the maximum number of houses in those areas. There is certainly no intention on the part of the Government to slow down activities in these areas. The intention is the very opposite.<br><br>
With regard to rents, the hon. Gentleman asked what would happen after 31st December 1974, and other hon. Gentlemen have asked about local authority and SSHA rents. As I said a week or two ago in the Standing Committee on the Housing (Scotland) Bill, we hope to say very soon what we intend for rents after 31st December. I would certainly hope that we shall make a statement about that before the House rises for the Summer Recess.<br><br>
So far as balancing the books is concerned, from the SSHA point of view that is not a particular difficulty because the books are balanced in relation to rents by the Government contribution. In a sense, this answers the points raised by hon. Members on both sides about the level of SSHA rents. So long as we have a system under which the deficits are borne by the Government—to the very considerable advantage, of course, of the local authorities in the areas concerned, as they then do not have to make any rate contribution towards the deficit—I think that the Government must
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0573">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
have an interest in the level of SSHA rents.<br><br>
If one has an association which builds houses all over Scotland and has a rent policy which is basically a Scottish one, then in particular areas the rents charged are likely to be out of step with those charged by local authorities. I also think it is human nature that it is only in those areas where SSHA rents are higher than local authority rents that Members of Parliament and Ministers are likely to hear about it. Taking Scotland as a whole, however, the latest published figures in the annual White Paper in May of this year for rents at November 1973 show that on average SSHA rents were not markedly out of step at that time. Admittedly they were rather higher, but on the other hand probably the gross annual value of the houses was also higher than the average for local authority houses, no doubt arising from the fact that the SSHA started later than local authorities in building houses to rent.<br><br>
Although it is true that the SSHA houses rents are higher, they are not a great deal higher, as some of the tenants, unfortunately, often believe. That does not mean to say that in particular areas there are not disparities which naturally cause the tenants concern. But, given the present situation and the financial set-up, I see great difficulty in reaching a conclusion which would produce comparability between local authorities and SSHA.<br><br>
It would be against the philosophy of the Government who wish to restore as soon as possible freedom to local authorities to determine their own rents if at the same time we were to look for exact comparability with SSHA rents which are to a considerable extent the concern of the Government and which are influenced by Government policies.<br><br>
An answer was given to my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Queen's Park (Mr. McElhone) yesterday on the matter of the sale of houses. The answer mentioned the SSHA as well as local authority houses and made the point that the sale of SSHA houses has always been subject to individual control. There is no change in the procedure there, but there is a change in the attitude of the Government and this change is outlined for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
local authority houses in the circular, a copy of which I shall make available to the hon. Gentleman, and that change of attitude will be imported into the attitude of the Department in dealing with any SSHA applications. The Government take the view that it is wrong for a local authority to sell houses in areas where there is an unsatisfied demand for houses to rent. As a Glasgow Member, I feel that very strongly indeed.<br><br>
So far as using the SSHA as a kind of research organisation is concerned, the SSHA participates in SLASH. That is one of the ways in which it makes a contribution to questions of research and development generally. SLASH itself now has groups which look into questions of external environment, rehabilitation and modernisation so that there is a real contribution. The Committee was slightly ambivalent about the SSHA's role in this field. On the one hand, hon. Members thought the association could make a contribution in research and, on the other, they complained about the terrible houses which the SSHA built in their constituencies. The SSHA, like local authorities, has built houses in some cases which no doubt it, as well as the unfortunate tenants afterwards regret. The problems of dampness and condensation are common, unfortunately, to some SSHA schemes and to some local authority schemes, too.<br><br>
I have had a long-standing problem in my own constituency of a scheme which has suffered from severe condensation and dampness problems over many years and where tenants have received the kind of answers that hon. Gentlemen have mentioned this morning about keeping the windows open and fires on. Incidentally, I always refuse to send on letters saying these things because it only adds insult to injury, in my view, to say that to the unfortunate tenants. Like other hon. Gentlemen, I have suffered from the effects of deficiencies in SSHA houses, in particular blocks which are now in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Selby) where at one time tenants had to be taken out of the houses and structural improvements made.<br><br>
Unfortunately, I do not think we can compare local authority and SSHA houses in this respect and give a clean bill of health to the one and not to the other.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0574">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
There have been deficiencies in both types of house and it is very important that research and development work should be an important part of the activities of local authorities and SSHA.<br><br>
Speaking as a layman, I find it appalling when new houses are found to suffer from problems of dampness and condensation, with which we are familiar in Scotland. Personally, I feel it is completely unforgivable from the architectural point of view that we should suffer in this way. I do not know why it happens, but, so far as it lies within the Government's power, we want to avoid these things happening either in SSHA or local authority housing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Craigen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the Minister accept that that largely happens because to far too great an extent the building industry is permitted to use new materials which have not been properly tested in many instances, with the result that tenants are the guinea pigs in their use?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There may be something in that. If there are particular aspects of this problem that hon. Gentlemen are able to draw to my attention with specific reasons for things going wrong, I shall be happy to look into them.<br><br>
I do not, however, want to give the impression that I am of the view that the SSHA does not pay attention to good design. It is unfair to say that about the SSHA. It pays considerable attention to good design, and it has within recent years had schemes which have received Civic Trust and Saltire Society awards. I know that it is extremely anxious to improve the quality of housing. That is true also with respect to external improvement, internal improvement and environmental improvement. The SSHA has a very creditable record on that. Some of us will have received within the past few days the first copy of a Tenants' Special informing tenants about what the association intends to do in the way of environmental improvement.<br><br>
The SSHA, like many local authorities, has made many mistakes. There have been schemes of which none of us can be proud. However, it recognises that these mistakes have been made and it is now making a substantial effort. The Government welcome the effort to improve both the external and internal look of houses.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
My hon. Friend the Member for Queen's Park mentioned his concern about the problems he had in his constituency with SSHA. I understand that he has written to my noble Friend Lord Hughes about these matters. Therefore, I shall simply promise him that I shall find out the situation. As he realises, my noble Friend has day-to-day responsibility for housing matters. However, if there is anything that can be done at Government level to help to resolve these problems, I shall certainly undertake to do it.<br><br>
I am familiar with the problem of television aerials in local authority houses in my constituency.<br><br>
I was glad to hear my hon. Friend pay tribute to his tenants' association. I believe that a tenants' association which is active on behalf of its tenants but is also reasonable and constructive in its atttiude towards the SSHA or the local authority has a very important role to play in housing management in keeping the Council of Management or the local authority itself on its toes.<br><br>
I shall certainly consider the question of a tenant serving on the Council of Management. There are certain difficulties, because it is a small Council of Management and we are not entitled to increase the number in an unrestricted way. There would also be difficulties about selection. But I take the point about tenants being involved, and I undertake to consider the proposition.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McElhone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for those assurances, especially with regard to my constituency. I expressed concern earlier that this order should perhaps be suspended if an investigation is not to be carried out. However, I appreciate the need to go ahead with building in the North-East.<br><br>
May I raise two matters? The Minister talked about the freedom of fixing rents and that this is a possibility in a new Scottish Office Bill. However, the difficulty, as my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Craigen) said, is that this is a non-elected body, and giving power to fix rents to a local authority over which the electors can have control is different from this bureaucratic body which is renominated every three or four years. In spite of being a small Council of Management,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0575">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
there should be at least one representative of the tenants' association on it. I gather there is a conglomerate body representing all SSHA tenants' associations in Scotland.<br><br>
On the question of lifts, which is an extremely urgent matter, I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his assurance that he will investigate the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have already dealt with the question of rents. I do not look upon the proposition that a tenant should go on the Council of Management as implying any commitment on rents. The Government have a strong interest in this and the Council of Management is not completely free on rents policy but is guided by governmental considerations.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Central (Mr. McMillan) raised the question of the Glasgow District. One of the problems at the moment is that the emphasis within the SSHA programme is away from the general needs and on areas of economic expansion and overspill. Therefore, at present it does not have a programme in Glasgow.<br><br>
I am not absolutely committed to the present policy. It originated in 1966, and obviously one does not wish in anyway to diminish the SSHA activity in the areas of economic expansion in which they are already involved. I am certainly willing to see whether there is a role that the SSHA can also play in the older urban areas of Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One of the problems in the area that I have inherited is a huge educational complex and depopulation. There are two play schools with very large capacities and three primary schools but no populatiton. The area is zoned as industrial, but the industry
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
has moved to Cambuslang and other areas. What are we to do about rezoning? If we can get rezoning and encourage the Scottish Special Housing Association to start housing projects we might be able to fill the schools.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is raising a number of wider issues which are not related to the SSHA. As the Member for Glasgow, Craigton, I am well aware of the problem. We have a number of unhappy situations in the older areas of Glasgow about which I am very concerned. I agree that we should pursue them with the Glasgow Corporation, but they are matters of general development and local authority policy which are not specifically related to SSHA.<br><br>
The SSHA has been taken away from these problems in recent years to concentrate upon other things. However, I am willing to see whether it has a role to play in the kind of development that my hon. Friend has in mind and which also affects my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Govan and other Members representing Glasgow constituencies.<br><br>
I think I have answered virtually all the questions that were put to me with perhaps the exception of one or two which were more detailed. I am glad that the importance of the SSHA is widely recognised by the Committee, together with the considerable and welcome work which it has done in Scotland. I am glad that the order is generally welcomed, and I commend it to the Committee.</span></p>
