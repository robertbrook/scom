	<div class='page-header'><h1>HOUSING (SCOTLAND) BILL</h1></div>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 13</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>GENERAL DUTY OF LOCAL AUTHORITY IN RESPECT OF HOUSES NOT MEETING TOLERABLE STANDARD</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 57, in page 13, line 7, leave out from ' standard ' to end of line 8 and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'by a date to be determined by the Secretary of State after consultation with each authority'.</p></blockquote>
The purpose of the amendment is to try to clear up what appears in the Bill to be a vagueness. At the end of the clause, the time limit which is put on bringing up to a tolerable standard houses which do not meet that standard as defined in Clause 14 is merely
	<br><blockquote><p>'such period as is reasonable in all the circumstances'.</p></blockquote>
This sort of vague provision on time leaves far too many options open to local authorities, where delays can occur. The purpose of the amendment is to try to ensure that in each case the Secretary of State is able to make sure that the right priorities are followed and that where cases occur in which the renewal and improvement or, indeed, the demolition should take place swiftly, the Secretary of State is able to exercise control over that. As the clause stands, a local authority could argue on many grounds that it did not need to do the work within a short period.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Teddy Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend. I am afraid that although successive Governments have faced up to the problems of clearing and improving Scotland's slums, with the best will in the world we have not done the job as quickly as we should. What has been lacking is a target date. If local authorities had a target date to which to work, a date agreed between them and the Secretary of State, there would be more incentive for them to keep to that date and to ensure that the job was done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>44</span>
There are all kinds of reasons for delay—planning hold-ups and administrative holdups, and so on. Many reasons for delay can be advanced. It would be unreasonable to fix a date for Scotland and say that the jobs had to be done by 1978, for instance, for the whole country, because circumstances vary enormously. In the Borders—although we sometimes think that this is a Glasgow problem—there are acute problems of sub-standard houses in some burghs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to recognise that each authority has a given problem. There is a strong case for a target date to be fixed. There will be difficulties in doing this, but my hon. Friend has advanced the case well and it is certainly worth consideration. I hope that the Minister will at least assure us that even if he cannot accept the amendment he will try to come to an informal understanding with the authorities as to what they would mutually agree to be a satisfactory date at which to aim for completing the job.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Mr. Bruce Milian)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can appreciate the reasons for the amendment. I have every sympathy with the objective that hon. Members have in mind. It is true that successive Governments have talked about solving the problems of Scotland's slums within a certain number of years and, as we know, unfortunately, the problem has not been solved yet and is not within reach of solution, as far as we can see, within the next few years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Basically, it is for that reason that I doubt very much whether it makes a great deal of sense to set targets. Certainly it does not seem to make a great deal of sense to set them under what would be, if the amendment were accepted, statutory provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important thing is that the Government should provide in the legislation every kind of statutory power which an authority will need to tackle the job and impose on it a general duty, as we do in the clause, to tackle the job. Then, having done that, the Secretary of State will have a considerable interest in seeing that local authorities move as rapidly as possible in this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to the point made by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart, (Mr. Taylor), I certainly give an undertaking that we shall see that local authorities discharge their duty under the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0045">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>45</span>
clause, and we shall make the necessary representations with any local authority which does not seem to be tackling the job as it ought to be—expeditiously. Having said that, however, it would be rather impracticable and, I think, probably a waste of effort for us to have to discuss with individual local authorities—there are over 200 of them at present, and there will be still a substantial number after local government reorganisation—the establishment of particular dates for achieving the aims of the clause in their areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I cannot recommend to the Committee that they accept the amendment. But obviously we shall be having consultations with local authorities, as necessary, on an individual and a collective basis once the Bill becomes an Act to see that the job is tackled as expeditiously as possible. I think that on both sides of the Committee the objective is the same. It is simply that I do not think that putting this provision into the Bill would add very much to that objective, and it might</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In accordance with the explanation I gave at an earlier Sitting, I</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 58, in page 13, line 10, after 'to', insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'the range, quality and suitability of'.</p></blockquote>
The purpose of the amendment is to try to provide in this part of the clause a safeguard for residents in and occupants of these houses. Again, this is an instance in which the clause as drafted is unclear, and in its unclarity it is likely to cause difficulty for the residents. By amending the clause to insert the words
	<br><blockquote><p>'the range, quality and suitability of'</p></blockquote>
it is our intention to try to provide safeguards for the people who are either being transferred to other houses because their houses are being demolished or are being decanted while their houses are being</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>46</span>
	<p>simply involve us in a good deal of administrative work, consultation and so on at the beginning of the operation of the Act, with no great purpose served at the end of it.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister's reply. However, I still feel that it is not enough to leave this matter merely in the hands of local authorities. As my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor) pointed out, there are local authorities, unfortunately—and there probably still will be local authorities—which will not be as diligent, perhaps, as they should be in seeing that the work is done. Unless a date is fixed by the Secretary of State, the work simply will not take place within the time that it should. Accordingly, I hope that my hon. Friends and hon. Members will support the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 7, Noes 7</p>
	<p>cast my vote with the Noes.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>renovated and brought up to a tolerable standard.</p>
	<p>The experience in previous cases of renovation has been that where there has not been suitable housing, especially for old people, while people's houses are being renovated, they have been decanted into unsuitable houses, in some cases with tragic consequences. The same applies, indeed, to cases in which people have been transferred because their houses are being demolished. Unless they can be assured before they are transferred that there are houses available into which they can move which are of a suitable quality for them, the clause as it stands could cause more harm than good to residents whose areas are being either razed to the ground or improved.</p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0046">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>47</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamish Gray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend in this amendment. It is very important. It would improve the clause considerably if these words were to be added. Taking "range, quality and suitability" and dealing with each of those, we can cover quite a piece of ground which is very important in these matters. For example, when people are moved out of homes which are to be demolished and are moved elsewhere, the kind of home to which they are transferred is of very great importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This varies throughout their country with different authorities. In a rural area, for example, the requirement can be different from that which is needed in a city. In my constituency I have a little experience of both requirements, because I have very large rural areas and in recent years we have had developing around us considerable industrial complexes as well. I know full well that what would be considered an ideally suitable house, perhaps, for a family from one part of the constituency might vary considerably from that which was desired elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all know the difficulties with which local authorities are faced. Some local authorities are blessed with extremely able planners and architects, whereas others, perhaps, are not so fortunate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Lambie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Name the authorities which are not so fortunate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the honourable Gentleman wish to intervene?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lambie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the honourable Gentleman name the local authorities in Scotland that are not serviced by good officials?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For that intervention I really should not have bothered to give way. It was fairly typical of what I always suspect from the honourable Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lambie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the honourable Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not suggest that there were not authorities who were served with good officials. I said that the quality of the architects varies and that in some authorities there are extremely able people who are able to diversify and accommodate all needs, whereas other authorities, perhaps, are not so well served.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>48</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lambie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the honourable Gentleman name them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not name them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The same description applies to Members of Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged, Sir Myer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I do not want to see necessary is a standard type of accommodation provided. There is a great danger of that unless every care is taken at that stage. After all, what might be acceptable to the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Lambie) in his constituency may certainly not be acceptable to some of my constituents. Just as their tastes differ, our tastes differ; at least, I hope that they do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The quality of work is also of great importance. When we talk about the quality of housing, we must talk also about the quality of the work. We can have various building skills brought into the external finish of houses. Their whole appearance can be made extremely suitable for a rural area especially—rather than concrete monsters. If some thought is given to this matter at a committee level and then given on an architectural basis later, the whole quality of life of those who are to occupy the houses can be improved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons I hope that the Minister will carefully consider our suggestion regarding the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I add my support to the amendment and I hope that we can carry hon. Members opposite with us on this occasion. We suggest the amendment not because it would make a fundamental change in the provisions for Governments and local authorities, but because it would be an indication of our attitude to this clause, and, indeed, to the provisions of the Bill as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is well know to some hon. Members present that in my short but happy spell at the Scottish Office before the election—which contrasted sharply with my previous time there, when I was not happy at all—I tried to get across that we should not regard measures such as this as popular and necessarily creating human happiness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are wrong if we regard a slum or run-down area necessarily as a place where many people are chafing at the bit to be rehoused and move elsewhere. Sometimes
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0047">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>49</span>
a wrong impression is given in this regard by housing propaganda agencies. Photographs and television programmes may depict families of seven or eight people living in appalling conditions, with no light or water. But when these matters are checked it is often found that the people involved are squatters who may have been evicted from other houses for not paying rent and electricity bills, for example. Housing propaganda agencies often give a wrong idea of what tenement areas are like.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In such areas, houses may be occupied by elderly people who have lived there for a long time. What are we asking them to give up, and what are we giving them in return? We are asking them to give up a great deal—for instance, the system of having an electric pre-payment meter. Some people may not think this important, but if they had spent their lives paying for electricity through a pre-payment meter and getting accustomed to receiving a bonus from the collector each quarter, they would realise that this can mean a great deal. Its importance is particularly underlined when people move into a new house and are suddenly faced with a quarterly electric bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are also asking people to give up the local shop in exchange for perhaps a single giant shopping centre, without any personal touch, in new housing schemes. We are asking them also to give up their local church, which may be near at hand. I believe that in all denominations elderly people are the backbone of the churches, which are often social refuges as well as other things.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further, we are asking people to give up old, cheap, controlled rents and low rates, as well as the idea of living near the city centre and all its facilities. In exchange for all this, we often give them a new house with a bath and inside toilet. While the prospect of moving into a new house can be exciting and can offer great hope for a young couple with perhaps three or four children, many elderly people do not look forward to the idea of being torn out of their own areas, where they have lived for many years, where their families grew up and where, in the case of widows their deceased husbands once lived. It can be the road to utter misery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Often, a wrong impression is given of what houses such as those in the area of the hon. Member for Glasgow,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>50</span>
Govan (Mr. Selby) are like. While many of the tenements are crumbling and the sanitation and plumbing are dreadful, they are often little palaces inside. They are well looked after by tenants who are happy to live there and who have all their memories there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the well merited intention of trying to clear some housing areas, we often end up moving people from city centres, from their friends and from their own environment and other facilities. They are faced with the costs of carpeting and furnishing for new homes, and this is a considerable problem for the elderly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although it will not necessarily make an enormous difference to the legislative provision, we should show that we appreciate that this is not necessarily a popular Bill which is bound to give happiness and joy to those who are moved out of the tenements. We believe that local authorities, before proceeding with these measures, must ensure that there is considerable range and quality of houses for people who are being moved. In certain parts of Scotland, particularly in big cities, there have been dramatic housing records. Houses have been built all over the place, but not enough small houses have been provided for the increasing aged population. Many of the houses in clearance areas are occupied by old people, including old couples.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While it would not make much difference to people's rights under this legislation, the amendment would set on record the attitude of the Committee. We do not want people to be offered new accommodation miles from their previous homes, their own environment, and their churches, friends and shops. We should not be rehousing people miles away; rather, we should be offering them a real home in circumstances appropriate to their needs. I hope that the Minister can at least accept the principle behind the amendment, which we regard as important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept a good deal of what has been said about the amendment, although not necessarily everything. Basically, the intention of the amendment is misplaced in this clause. We are dealing here with the general picture that the local authority must take account of in determining its basic policy about housing action areas and such matters. We are not dealing in this clause with what
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0048">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>51</span>
happens in the circumstances of the individual tenant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that, even without the provisions of this clause, the local authority which is discharging its obligations under the clause will have to have regard to the kind of alternative accommodation which would be available for people who are displaced, and that would include the range, quality, and suitability of the accommodation as well as a number of other factors not mentioned in the amendment—for instance, the size and number of houses that would be available as alternative accommodation. Therefore, I do not believe that the amendment would make a substantial difference to the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, that does not mean that I do not accept the general proposition that, in the case of an area where, under other legislation-for instance, that involving a closing order-the local authority is placed under an obligation to rehouse a tenant who is displaced, the rehousing should be of a suitable standard. I accept that absolutely, but it is already provided for under Section 36 of the Land Compensation (Scotland) Act 1973, and by the provisions of Schedule 3 to this Bill the provisions of that Act regarding rehousing are brought into any of the provisions of the Bill which might involve rehousing of tenants. Therefore, the statutory provision regarding suitability is already present. The important point is that, in implementing the statutory provisions, the local authority should have regard to a number of matters which hon. Members have mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I doubt whether we can write into the Bill all the factors of which we would want to see a local authority take account. It would be extremely difficult to do so. I do not believe that the addition of a few words, such as proposed in the amendment, could possibly do the job in practice. If it is a good local authority, doing its job well, it will do the job without these words being included; if it is a local authority which is not doing the job well the insertion of the words in the amendment will not make any difference to its actual performance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is better in a matter of this sort to try to proceed by way of guidance to local authorities through Departmental circulars. A Departmental circular dealing with this matter has already been issued, and we shall consider sending out further guidance to local authorities after
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>52</span>
the Bill is passed. I do not think that the amendment should be agreed to and I hope that it will be withdrawn. However, I undertake that, in the guidance which we shall send out after the Bill is passed, bringing previous guidance up to date, we shall take account of the points made this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we wished to change the legislation, we should want to do so in a different part of the Bill. For reasons which I have explained the amendment will not do the job. It is better to have more detailed guidance of a more informal kind rather than to insert these words in the Bill. I hope that with the assurance I have given the honourable Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Henderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the Minister's argument, but does not he feel that an amendment of this kind has merit in that the legislation to which he referred, which could meet some of these points, is not linked to the provision of housing action areas? In other words, it would not itself be grounds for the Secretary of State refusing to accept a proposal for a housing action area. We are looking here for a way to ensure that, when a housing action area is defined, it is possible to ensure that the wider considerations, in terms of the planning and implementation of the housing action area, can be effectively carried out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are other safeguards regarding the Secretary of State's approval which can take care of what the honourable Gentleman has mentioned.

This is a most important amendment. It is not sufficient that we should merely pass Acts of Parliament and then withdraw from all further responsibility. We have a duty to see that Acts of Parliament are carried out in terms of justice not only being done, but being seen to be done. It is the duty of Parliament to monitor local authorities to ensure that they are carrying out their obligations under the Bill, and that is why we want to include this amendment.

I represent a part of Scotland where we are about to see much growth in housing and housing action areas, although it may not appear to have the same importance as other areas. But the converse might be the case. Some housing action areas might be forgotten in the flood of euphoria regarding the new housing required in the North of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two-thirds of my constituency is rural, but one-third includes the urban ring round Aberdeen and this is a fast growing housing area. In the North of Scotland there are burghs such as Peterhead, Keith and Elgin, but hon. Members who could be taking an important part in these deliberations are not here today. The North-East of Scotland is a vitally important area. Perhaps housing action areas do not attract a great deal of publicity, but there is a difference between service and publicity and between responsibility and irresponsibility. It saddens me that I seem to be the only Member—and I do not include the three Scottish National Members—from the North-East of Scotland who is interested in the importance of this Bill to the people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>54</span>

This measure has an important part to play in the revival of areas of housing in Scotland. I think that there should be some way in which we can ensure that the intention of the Bill is followed through.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that we should have information at parliamentary level about what is happening following the implementation of this measure, but I do not think that it is necessary to write such a provision into the Bill. There is, of course, a need for us to have information about many other aspects of housing, and the annual report from the Scottish Office gives a good deal of information of that nature. There is also the housing return for Scotland, which is published quarterly, giving information specifically related to improvement, the clearance of slums and other matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such information is already available. Nevertheless, we have in mind to improve the information and to improve the statistics following the recommendation of the Expenditure Committee in its 10th report on improvement grants that statistics relating to unfit houses should be improved and that a better system of monitoring the performance of local authorities should be established. That recommendation has been accepted by the Government and we are working on improving the quarterly returns. I ask that the principle within the amendment should not be written in the Bill because other statutes dealing with housing do not include a similar provision. It seems unnecessary to put such a provision in the Bill when there is a whole range of housing legislation which does not include the statutory obligation to make a report.

I am moving this amendment to try to remove wording which could cause confusion to the people who will be affected by these provisions—namely, those whose houses will be demolished, as in the case of this clause, or improved, as in the case of Clauses 16 and 17.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that Amendment No. 62 was not selected as it is in a sense the other half of this amendment. Nevertheless, the purpose of amendment No. 61 can stand on its own. The reason for tabling the amendment is that previous experience following the 1969 Act, in which certain areas were not called housing action areas but housing treatment areas, is that when notification was sent to the residents whose houses were to be involved there was a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0051">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>57</span>
great deal of confusion in their minds as to whether their houses were to be renewed, so that they would be able to return to a house with a new lease of life, or whether they would be demolished and razed to the ground.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is to try to prevent that sort of confusion—and I am sure that it will be appreciated that it causes great anxiety in the minds of residents—that I am moving the amendment. It would ensure that notification under this clause would be for demolition and for nothing else. In that way the people who received notification would be in no doubt of their position. I hope that the Minister will give this matter a sympathetic hearing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend's amendment. We know that when people receive official notices they become confused. It may be said that a housing action area for demolition has a clear meaning. Nevertheless, I feel that when five or six words are used when two would suffice we should use only two. That applies particularly to official notices that could confuse the people concerned. It would be better, if we mean a demolition area, to say just that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin F. Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment and I urge my hon. Friend to consider it carefully and accept it. It is my experience, when people have come to my surgery with these notices, that they believe that their house is to be improved. They come to me for advice and it seems never to cross their minds that housing treatment subsumes demolition. It is rather like going to a hospital as a patient, understanding that an illness is to be treated, only to discover that treatment includes amputation. Perhaps that would be justified in medical jargon but it would give a severe shock to the patient. I believe that we should consider making some change in the terminology so that a repetition of the confusion which I have described will not take place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have considered this amendment and amendment No. 62 which has not been called. The two amendments would require a substantial number of other amendments. I am not sure that a change of terminology would make the kind of difference that hon. Members have in mind. What is much more important than changing the Bill's
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>58</span>
terminology is to ensure that any notices which go to individual house owners or tenants about housing action areas are explicit. The Bill's provisions regarding housing action areas provide that a notice shall be sent at the draft resolution stage and then at the final stage to every individual who is likely to be affected. It is specifically provided that such notices must tell the individual whether his house is to be improved or demolished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further, the form of the notices will be prescribed by the Secretary of State. I give an undertaking that in prescribing the form of the notices we shall have in mind the necessity of making it clear to anyone who receives a notice whether his house is to be improved or demolished. There are a number of different things that can be done to make the matter clear. I do not believe that the amendment is the most practical way of dealing with the problem. Simply to change the wording will not help. For example, it would not solve the problem in an improvement and demolition area. To change the terminology would not do very much in an improvement area because no difficulty arises about the word "improvement". It is only in the demolition area and the demolition and improvement area that there might be some kind of confusion. In the demolition and improvement area no change in the wording of the Bill can help the position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that this matter can be of real concern to the individuals involved. I suggest that it is much better to approach the matter on the basis of ensuring that the notices are drawn up in a way which makes it clear to the person receiving them what it is intended should happen to their house. The forms will be prescribed by the Secretary of State and I undertake to ensure that the matter is made clear and that the forms are written in simple language. Perhaps by the use of different coloured forms we can eliminate some of the difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With those assurances I hope that the honourable Gentleman will be willing to withdraw the amendment. I do not think that to change the wording will help substantially. I shall consider what has been said before Report and I shall consider whether it is necessary to change the wording. Such a change would mean substantial changes all the way through the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his answer. I am sceptical about his view that to change the wording to "demolition area" would not get across the message to the people living in the house that it was to be demolished. I would have thought that "demolition area" could mean nothing else but demolition. It is in cases of demolition that it is vital that the residents should know what is to happen to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Minister's undertaking that he will consider the matter before Report. I hope that he will write to me and perhaps to other hon. Members on another matter to let us know what form the notice will take. The word "demolition" should be printed very large and clear where it is the operative word. It must be made clear to each resident that his house will be razed to the ground.

This is what might be called a genuine probing Amendment. What does the subsection mean? It seems that basically we are deeming something to be what it may not be, and it is always dangerous to have legislation that does that. We are saying that
	<br><blockquote><p>'a house in respect of which a closing order has been made …shall be deemed to be a house which does not meet the tolerable standard'.</p></blockquote>
It seems to me that whenever we see the word "deem" in legislation it means that we can call something what it may not be. It is unfortunate. I have seen "deem" used seven times over the past year in legislation, and every time it means that we shall assume that something will be what it may not be. It is always silly to put it in legislation unless it is necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter we are now considering is rather complicated. We are repeating something in the 1969 Act. A difficulty arose from a previous measure in which a house was deemed to be a building or part of a building which is occupied or is intended to be occupied as a separate dwelling. Once a closure order has been placed on a house, it is no longer occupied or intended to be occupied as a separate dwelling, and therefore doubt arose as to whether a house in respect of which a closure order had been made met the other definitions of the Acts for housing treatment areas and so on. Therefore, there was an anomalous position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was a legal technicality, but apparently it gave some local authorities difficulty, in that a house on which a closing order had been placed was no longer a house for the purposes of the legislation, and therefore nothing could happen to it. That was an absurdity. This wording was put in the 1969 Act to take care of it, and it is repeated here. No doubt the difficulty could be taken care of with much more substantial and detailed amendments to other legislation, but on the whole it seems better to have it here, dealing with the question of housing action areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the honourable Gentleman for his reply, I do not entirely understand it, but the way in which he gave the impression of fully understanding the situation leads me to believe that if I study his answer in HANSARD I shall be fully satisfied.

	<br><blockquote><p>'10'.</p></blockquote>
The effect of the amendment is to reduce from 15 years to 10 the period for which local authorities are satisfied that houses have a future life. There is no scientific way of measuring the future physical life of a building. No one can say which property that appears to be crumbling will survive for the next 10 or 20 years. Nobody can foresee which apparently sound tenement may become the subject of a dangerous building order next week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I give as an example the Stock Exchange building in Edinburgh. When the Stock Exchange first wanted to put up a new building, it said that it wanted to build it in Queen Street, and it asked for a demolition order on a listed building there which it claimed was falling down anyway. Ten years later, the listed building is still there and is very sound, and it is the new Stock Exchange building that has fallen down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One cannot distinguish between 10 years and 15 years for the future physical life of a building. We are talking about the life of the building within the terms of planning proposals for the area, and the amendment is pertinent because we cannot foresee those proposals beyond the next 10 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I could illustrate this point with two examples from our two major cities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Edinburgh, there is considerable indecision over the roads proposals. There always has been indecision over them, and there always will be. Much of the slum clearance programme for the next five years is affected by those road proposals. Therefore, it cannot be said that the buildings concerned have a guaranteed life of 15 years, because the road proposals may be agreed. But it can be said that they have a guaranteed life of 10 years, because even if the road proposals are confirmed it will be 10 years before the stage of knocking down the buildings is reached.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we make the change that I propose, a larger number of buildings could be improved to a fairly high standard. In Glasgow, the project in Govan carried out
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>62</span>
by ASSIST is now coming to an end. The area was given a life of 10 years, because the site was required for a further education college. If the amendment is not made, it will not be possible for a similar project to insist on a higher standard where there is such a limited life for the area. The irony here is that, now that the project is coming to an end, Glasgow Corporation has announced that it no longer requires the site for a college, and the property has a life of 30 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That shows that one cannot plan beyond a 10-year period. Therefore, I commend the amendment, which would bring the Bill into line with the similar period given in Clause 54 (5) of the English Bill. I know that officials of my own local authority are anxious to see this change, and I hope that my hon. Friend will accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend has explained, the amendment concerns an area of some difficulty. It is not possible to say that any particular period will be exactly right in all the circumstances. The period in the subsection determines the level to which improvements in a house will be made, the standard to which a house will be brought. In all cases, the house has to meet a tolerable standard and has to be in a good state of repair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The time limit is directed to the question whether a house should also be provided with all the standard amenities. The limit laid down is 15 years. But I have considerable sympathy with what my hon. Friend has said, and I gather that many local authorities feel the same. They point out, as has my hon. Friend, that in terms of local planning 10 years is about as far ahead as one can look.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I am willing to recommend to the Committee that they accept the amendment. It will give additional powers to local authorities and may mean that we can improve certain houses for the great benefit of those occupying them even if the period of life is no longer than 10 years. This is a desirable improvement. There may have to be consequential amendments elsewhere to provide for consistency, but that need not prevent our accepting the amendment now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important amendment, which we on this side of the Committee accept. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Cook) has

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>63</span>
advanced a convincing case for it. However, I have one caveat. We are happy to accept the amendment mainly because of the circumstances the honourable Gentleman outlined. It is not because we think that we should spend an enormous amount of money on major improvements to properties with a very limited physical life. One of the great unknowns of the Bill is the cost of improving some old tenement properties. The experience in Glasgow, and, I understand, to a lesser degree in Edinburgh, is that the financial cost of major improvements to tenements is always greatly in excess of what it might appear to be in the first instance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, while there is an excellent case for the amendment, I hope that local authorities will not regard it as an "Open Sesame" to the spending of vast sums on houses with a limited physical life.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe that the amendment will have that effect. One of the other circumstances that should be taken into account is that prospects for a house which seem pessimistic at one time are often not justified by events. Quite often a local authority's plans provide for a house or an area to be demolished within, say, 10 years, but the process takes a good deal longer. I think that local authorities will welcome the period now proposed, because it will give them more scope.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The subsection with which we are now dealing ensures that the Secretary of State can waive both of the requirements in those subsections.

and Amendment No. 72, in Clause 30, page 25, line 15, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(3) If the Secretary of State refuses to make such a direction, an owner may make application to the Sheriff for the house to be designated as well maintained if, in the opinion of the Sheriff, the house falls within the criteria set out in this section'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of these amendments is to give an additional safeguard to residents. Amendment No. 63 relates to Clause 18 which allows the Secretary of State, if he is satisfied, to give directions in regard to the waiving of requirements where
	<br><blockquote><p>'the greater part of the houses in any area…lack one or more of the standard amenities'.</p></blockquote>
There may be circumstances where the Secretary of State could use this authority, but this will be in a case where he considers that a minority of houses in an area are of an intolerable standard. He will then use the power to apply to the whole area. In such an instance, the resident has no means of appealing against a decision. The purpose of Amendment No. 63 is to give protection to the citizen who is threatened by an upset of this kind, so that he may have an opportunity to go to the sheriff to ask whether the proposed direction is unreasonable and contrary to the general interests of residents in the local authority area as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that this amendment seeks to bring another factor into the Bill, but in the sensitive area of housing, where people's homes are involved, it is important that people who feel that they have a complaint should have a means of appeal. We believe that the sheriff is the right person to whom that appeal should lie.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 68 relates to Clause 22, subsection (2) of which refers to,
	<br><blockquote><p>'any other part of the building so identified'.</p></blockquote>
We believe that this gives a local authority far too great a power of decision-making which could adversely affect the residents of other parts of a building. In Scotland, perhaps unlike other parts of the United Kingdom, we have buildings which are very large indeed. In some Scottish cities, tenement buildings take up almost the whole side of a street and possibily affect streets on the other side of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>66</span>
building. People within a building affected by the Bill's provisions could be put at a disadvantage. Therefore, it is important that residents should have recourse to appeal, in this case to the sheriff, if they believe they have a legitimate complaint.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 72 relates to Clause 30. That clause deals with payment in respect of well-maintained houses. It is left in the hands of the local authorities and the Secretary of State to decide whether the house has been properly maintained and whether the work involved has to a material extent been carried out by the resident or at his expense. Any arbitrary decision could give rise to a feeling of injustice, if not to an actual injustice. It is essential that we should encourage people to maintain their houses in a proper fashion, but it is important that if a resident feels unfairly treated he should be able to go to the sheriff, who is a judicial personage, to get the complaint aired and, if necessary, put right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the purpose lying behind all three amendments. I admit that perhaps they extend the Bill by bringing in a judicial factor where no such factor existed before, but there are other parts of the Bill which provide for recourse to a sheriff. Therefore, these amendments will not affect the Bill to any great extent. We believe that, if accepted, they will improve the Bill and bring about an extra safeguard where needed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I strongly support my hon. Friend. The Bill gives wide and sweeping powers to local authorities to take over areas and property. We accept that, in view of the urgency of the situation, if an area is covered by the strict criteria laid down in Clauses 15 (1), 16 (1) and 17 (1), the authority should be able to go ahead, and we wish to put no restriction in its way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Amendment No. 63, we are not suggesting powers that would hold up development in a normal housing action area. We do not wish to place in the way of the local authorities time-wasting procedures. We are suggesting that where extraordinary powers are used—and where the word ' deemed ' is used—there should be a basic right of appeal by a local resident when he feels that the power is being unfairly used. We suggest that there should be a simple appeal to the sheriff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0056">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>67</span>
It may be suggested that there is no need for this proposal because all local authorities will act reasonably. If I were to suggest that some local authorities might act unreasonably, I know that the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Lambie) would challenge me to say which authorities I had in mind. Let me tell him that there are some local authorities in Scotland which I do not trust on the issue of housing. I know that some are dominated by people who believe that their task is to municipalise all private rented property. I know that there are people in the Parliamentary Labour Party who take this view. Some of them, such as the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire, may before long find themselves in positions of considerable responsibility. In these circumstances we must have some kind of protection against the unusual use of powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be suggested that sheriffs would have a difficult job in deciding whether there was an unreasonable use of power. I do not agree, since I believe that a sheriff will bear in mind the interests of residents in a local authority area as a whole. If we are considering a good area where only 10 per cent. of the houses are not to a tolerable standard, an area in which people in general look after their properties, and if a bad local authority, perhaps aided and abetted by a bad Secretary of State—I do not suggest that this is the situation at present but it could happen if there were a re-shuffle—took unreasonable action, then there should be some protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that it is dangerous to give such wide and sweeping powers as those contained in the Bill. They will no doubt work well if everybody acts reasonably and harmoniously, but we are suggesting that some simple safegard should be provided to meet the case where unusual powers are employed. We are not suggesting proposals which, in a normal housing action area, would hinder developments. All we are saying is that when unreasonable action is taken, the individual should have some protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 72 is, in a sense, in a separate category. The Bill provides poor compensation for houses which are to be taken over or demolished. On the other hand, the Secretary of State has taken power, where he believes that a house is well-maintained, to make extra cash available to a resident whose house is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>68</span>
being demolished. Unfortunately, again there is no provision for appeal if that person feels aggrieved. It is only fair that there should be some kind of appeal system if local authorities are to be given more and more rights. Tenants and owners must have some protection. We believe that these provisions would provide a reasonable safeguard which might be a restraint on local authorities which use powers unreasonably.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that I could not recommend the Committee to accept any of these amendments. Each amendment contains power for an appeal to a sheriff against a discretionary decision of the Secretary of State. Such a power would not be in accordance with our normal practice and, we believe, would be highly undesirable. There is a difference between an appeal to the sheriff on a point of law and an appeal to the sheriff on a discretionary decision of the Secretary of State. The way in which our Parliamentary democracy works places powers in the hands of the Secretary of State in all sorts of areas, but he is accountable to Parliament for the way in which he exercises them. Therefore, I say at the outset that the amendments should be rejected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 63 directs itself towards Clause 18(2), which gives a wider power to local authorities to declare a housing action area in circumstances where normally that would not be possible. I should have thought that would be welcome to Conservative Members, since I know that many now present in the Committee represent areas to which the normal housing action area provisions would be difficult to apply, whereas many of the Labour Members in this Committee represent city constituencies where those provisions will apply. In other words, the Bill's provisions provide opportunities for local authorities in small burghs, villages and rural areas to obtain some of the advantages of housing action areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What circumstances are envisaged in which a resident would feel himself at a disadvantage in terms of the Bill? It is suggested that such a person could be in a number of categories. It should be remembered that when the draft resolution is passed by the local authority the residents will receive a notice and will have an opportunity to make representations.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0057">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>69</span>
A resident may live in a house which is fit only for demolition. I am not sure whether such a person would be in any different situation from any other resident in any other housing action area where a house is fit only for demolition. In view of the provisions relating to rehousing, I do not see that such a person could be at a disadvantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, to take another example, the person is in a house which is to be improved, then he will have a positive advantage if the area is declared a housing action area. Improvements will be carried out with grants of 75 per cent. instead of 50 per cent., and therefore again such a person will not be placed at a disadvantage. Furthermore, a resident will not be placed at a disadvantage by having other houses in the surrounding area improved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The idea behind the Bill is to improve an area's general standard. If the resident lives in a house which does not have to be improved, he will be informed that his house will be neither demolished nor improved because it is already of a satisfactory standard. That person will not be at a disadvantage when houses surrounding his dwelling are to be improved. In other words, if he lives in a satisfactory house in an unsatisfactory area, it is to his advantage that the area should be improved. I hope that, for all these reasons, Amendment No. 63 will be rejected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 68 deals with Clause 22, involving purchases by the local authority by agreement. If the person concerned does not wish to sell his house to a local authority, there is nothing in the clause to enforce the sale and the amendment will provide no protection for the individual at all, because we are dealing here with purchase by agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When one comes to Clause 26, dealing with compulsory purchase, the situation is different, and then the normal protections are available to the individual faced with a compulsory purchase order, as they are available in the rest of our legislation dealing with compulsory purchase. In relation to Clause 30 and Amendment No. 72 the circumstances are rather different, because I suppose that it could be claimed that an individual who applied for a "well maintained" payment felt aggrieved because it was refused.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>70</span>
But the amendment falls foul of the basic principle that I mentioned earlier. We are dealing here only with the "well maintained" payment. There are other provisions relating to compulsory purchase and so on which we can discuss on other occasions, but in the case of the "well maintained" payment the situation has been that this is a power which rests in the discretion of the Secretary of State. It would be wrong in principle to give a further appeal from that to the sheriff, for reasons which I have explained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions that we have in Clause 30 go as far back as the Housing (Scotland) Act 1950. So far as I am aware, there have been no serious complaints that those provisions are not carried out with considerable skill and fairness by officers acting on behalf of the Secretary of State. Therefore, I do not think that we need additional provisions here. But if the present situation were unsatisfactory, for whatever reason, I am afraid that I could not recommend the Committee to remedy the position by providing an appeal to the sheriff from a decision of the Secretary of State. If there were evidence that these provisions were not working satisfactorily—I do not have that evidence—obviously I would be willing to consider it. But if I wanted to change the Bill I would have to recommend to the Committee that we did it in a way that was rather different from what is suggested in the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons I do not recommend the Committee to accept any of the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed by the Minister's reply. We have here a very important point. The burden of the Minister's argument seems to be that it appears to be an unprecedented kind of amendment. I accept that. But we are giving here unprecedented powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's second point was: no one would want to complain, so why should a procedure be set up? We are living in a fool's paradise if we do not believe that there will be significant grounds for complaint from people whose houses are being improved. They may come, for instance, from people who live in three dwellings in a house which has three floors when we say that we are making them into two and giving them bathrooms. Before we proceeded with municipal improvements
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0058">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>71</span>
the view was taken that everyone would welcome them. I wish that hon. Members would take a trip to Knightswood in Glasgow some day and hear what people are saying there about the wonderful improvements which everyone thought that he would be welcoming. These improvements can often involve people in major upsets to their lives and in being housed in areas in which they do not want to live.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not suggested that in an area in which the houses are not of tolerable standard we should hold up what the Government want to do. But if we are to have housing action areas set up in areas in which houses are not of a tolerable standard, we must give people protection against a power for the local authority to go ahead and start massive improvements or demolition projects which may be against the wishes of the residents or may not take those wishes into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister feels that this protection will not be needed, nothing will be lost by inserting it. As a matter of principle, when giving great rights to local authorities we should think of the rights of residents and tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances, to register our view on this matter—I do not want to take up the time of the Committee later by dividing on all the amendments, as we are now discussing the three amendments together—I hope that my hon. Friends will divide on Amendment No. 63. If we win, I hope that we shall go on and vote on the other two amendments. But if we do not win, perhaps we should regard a Division on Amendment No. 63 as our protest. We firmly believe that there is a need for more protection for people in areas in which extraordinary powers are being used by the local authorities and the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Corrie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friends in this matter. Some people who have not been mentioned in the debate are those who have just improved their houses when a new scheme comes along. They are suddenly told, for instance, that things are to be covered by electrification and that night storage heaters will be put in. If someone has put in a gas system at his own expense, this will have to be taken out and something else put in. Surely those people should be covered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>72</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Milan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to carry this argument on. Some hon. Members are anxious to express disapproval of the Government about something, and this appears to be just as good as anything. The hon. Member for Bute and North Ayrshire (Mr. Corrie) is talking, perhaps, of different circumstances and what happens in local authority schemes where a tenant has gone one way and the local authority decides to go another. That is a particular point of difficulty. But that would not happen under this scheme because the provisions could not be overturned by the authority simply because it had a view about gas or electricity, or some other view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the general point, I do not dispute what the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor) said about people wishing, perhaps, to make known objections to having improvements done. I accept that. That is why there are provisions for representation in the Bill. But there seems no reason at all to provide an additional safeguard in the particular circumstances of Clause 18(2). If one wants an additional safeguard in the Bill, it ought to be put in on a wider basis. Clause 18(2), taken by itself, is not so special that one needs additional safeguards there. I do not want to re-open the whole argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a Committee we must remember that it is not a satisfactory appeal to say that one can make representations to the local authority if the local authority has made the decision to use extraordinary powers and the Secretary of State has supported it. It is not enough to say that the local authority will thereby be the court of appeal and that one can thereby make representations. We want someone apart from the local authority to whom one can appeal. That is why we shall press Amendment No. 63. I hope that every hon. Member will vote for that amendment, although the Minister has indicated that he may not be able to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed with the Minister's reply. Some of his arguments seem to be that because people have not so far needed a safeguard, a safeguard should not be provided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>73</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's argument seemed extraordinary. We are extending the powers of local authorities and in certain circumstances giving power to the Secretary of State over many new areas. It is essential that a safeguard is provided. It is all very well to say that in the past with other sorts of legislation people have not had to complain. But as my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor) said, we are here creating a new situation in which it is quite likely that people will complain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When talking about the first of the amendments and the clause, the Minister was referring to the benefits to people of having the houses around them improved. But the clause deals with areas in which the majority of the houses do not need improvements. The Minister asked for examples. I have in my constituency a case at present in which certain steel houses were built in the 1930s and a decision was made that they should come down. These houses were all in excellent condition. They happen to have been tenanted by people who had taken great care of them and had done a lot of work on them themselves. This decision had nothing to do with the question whether they were tolerable. It was a policy decision that they would have to come down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My reading of sub-section (2) is that this is the sort of provision which will be used when houses are not of an intolerable standard but are in an area in which most houses must be improved or demolished. In those circumstances, it is not sufficient to say that representation can be made to the local authority or the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State is in the position then of being the author of a policy and the final arbiter as to whether his decision is fair. This dual position of the local authority or the Secretary of State gives no confidence to the people of Scotland that justice is being done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not criticising local authorities or the way in which the Secretary of State can exercise this power. All that I am asking for in the three amendments is that the people of Scotland should realise at the end of the day that they have a final court of appeal to which they can go.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that courts of appeal were for points of law. In most circumstances that is true. But there are vast areas in Scotland where the sheriff, sitting in the Sheriff Court, acts as an arbiter on
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>74</span>
the facts, and these elements are creating another area in which the Sheriff is asked to decide on facts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the honourable Gentleman is a lawyer, but Amendment No. 63 is not concerned with facts. It is concerned exclusively with judgment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 63 days:
	<br><blockquote><p>'the exercise of such power shall be subject to annulment by the sheriff if, on application by a resident affected by the proposed direction, the sheriff takes the view that the proposed direction is unreasonable and contrary to the general interests of residents '.</p></blockquote>
That is a decision on fact. It is not a decision on a point of law. The general interests of residents could never be defined at law. That is where the sheriff would be exercising the position of arbiter rather than judge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other cases in which this happens. In other areas there are cases in which other judicial bodies deal with this position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend accept that there was one very interesting recent case which took place in the Sheriff Court in Glasgow? That was in relation to the way in which the Corporation of Glasgow is exercising its powers in relation to the taxi trade—a matter in which the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Selby) took a very real interest. This was exactly the same kind of determination of the facts of reasonableness of the case as we are considering. The Sheriff Court in that particular case was deciding something on the same kind of basis as we would hope that it would decide this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to my hon. Friend for producing that example of a sheriff exercising this sort of function. I do not want to continue for too long, but the attitude that has been taken by the Minister makes me very suspicious. A set of new powers is being created.

This amendment is similar to an earlier amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor). It is concerned merely with the use of words. I suggest that the wording "may be" means nothing. However, on the general point it would not be right for someone who has been here only a short time to criticise parliamentary draftsmen. Indeed, I make no criticism of them or of the great deal of work they do. Before I came to the House, I was worried about the amount of paper in local authorities and in industry, but I had never seen as much paper as I have since I came here, and I feel that about two-thirds of it must be wasted—no doubt a reason why recycling has got to come. I say this particularly bearing in mind the paper mills in my constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>I am suspicious when told that when new power is to be created nobody has a final body to which he can go to try to get the exercise of powers questioned. For that reason, I hope that the amendment will be supported by the Committee.</p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes, 6; Noes, 7.</p>
	<p>wastage of paper by putting down similar amendments to the clause, because the expression to which the honourable Gentleman referred appears four times in the clause, in lines 10, 30 and 37 as well as in line 27. I am informed that it makes no difference and that the meaning in legal terms is exactly the same, whether we stick to the wording which we have at present or insert that proposed in the amendment. To make such a change would not import any greater sense of urgency into the clause. If there was to be a change we should, for consistency, have to make changes at three other places in the clause and possibly elsewhere, thus taking up the time not only of draftsmen and civil servants but also of Ministers and hon. Members. The wording should be left as it is. I do not advise the Committee to accept the amendment.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a bit disappointed with the Minister's answer. We accept that the phrase is mentioned four times in the clause, but its use in line 27 is the one which we want to tighten up. We have no objection to local authorities submitting a draft resolution to the Secretary of State. They can take their time if they want. Our objection relates to cases where the Secretary of State may say that he cannot consider the matter in 28 days
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0061">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>77</span>
and that he needs more time. An obligation should be imposed to ensure that the Secretary of State gives a decision "as soon as practicable thereafter".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be suggested that the expressions "may be" and "practicable thereafter" mean the same, but I wonder what we as laymen, as opposed to the lawyers, think about it. If, for instance, I said to my hon. Friend the Member for Ross and Cromarty (Mr. Gray), "Let us finish the the deliberations as soon as may be", or, "as soon as may be practicable", he would think that there was a difference between the two. One expression has greater sense of urgency than the other. But if the Minister, aided and abetted by his legal friend behind him, sees no difference, he should find other words to bring more urgency into the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State may say that he cannot decide a matter in 28 days—he may be too busy because he has first to nationalise 100 firms in Britain. There should at least be an obligation on him in such circumstances to come to a decision in as reasonable a time as he can. The Minister may say that "practicable thereafter" are not the correct words. I suggest, therefore, that the Minister should talk to the draftsman and say that words implying more urgency are needed. He should look at this matter between now and Report. We are not trying to tell the Minister or the draftsman their jobs. But we are worried about such things as Ministerial changes. I notice, for instance, that the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Lambie) has adopted an attitude of careful caution on the Committee—it may be that he is destined for higher things. We must think not just in terms of reasonable Ministers, as we may have now, but also of high flyers, more vigorous and excitable people whom we may have in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The honourable Gentleman must address himself to the amendment and not attempt to make forecasts about the behaviour of future Ministers, or about appointments which may be given to members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that everyone, including yourself, Sir Myer, has an interest in this matter, but I do not wish to push it too far. However, we believe there is a case to tighten up the words.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>78</span>
Would the Minister, if he does not readily agree with the words which we suggest, at least agree to look at the matter and to have consultations between now and Report?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the explanation of my hon. Friend the Minister of State, but I must press for some clarification. Has he any notion or idea how often the Secretary of State is likely to have to use the powers under subsection (3) (	<i>c</i>) to have the period extended? As I understand it, this clause replaces an existing provision in the 1969 Act whereby a treatment area order has to be confirmed by the Secretary of State. In the past two years, treatment area orders which have been sent to St. Andrew's House for confirmation have disappeared for a long time. It took between six and 12 months before they came back. I understand the average has been about eight months and that it is now lengthening rather than shortening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Bill, the period has been considerably shortened to 28 days in, presumably, most cases. That is a considerable foreshortening. Has the Department been strengthened and have changes been made to accommodate this reduction of the period, which I welcome? If not, I fear that it will be the generality rather than the exception that the Secretary of State uses powers under paragraph (	<i>c</i>) to notify that he requires an extension. If this is the case, any amendment at this stage has added pertinence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The intention is that it would be an exceptional circumstance where one would go beyond 28 days. There would not be much point in stipulating 28 days and then allowing everything to proceed at a more leisurely pace by using the exceptions provision. This provision is for exceptional cases and there does not seem to be much virtue in adding a precise further period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor) has asked me to think again about the amendment. I was intending to accept the amendment, since it makes no difference, and it looked at one point that it might make some hon. Members happy if I did. If the honourable Gentleman wishes me to look at it again, instead of accepting it, I am willing to do so. However, if any hon. Member feels strongly, I am perfectly
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0062">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>79</span>
happy to accept the amendment. But my advice is that it will make no practical difference. If anyone can think of other words, I shall consider them on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 66, in page 18, line 3, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'and (	<i>c</i>) serve on every owner, lessee and occupier of any premises to which the draft resolution relates an invitation to a meeting to be held in a public hall or other suitable building in the vicinity at which officials of the authority can explain the effect of the resolution and answer questions '.</p></blockquote>
This is an important amendment. Under the provisions of the Bill, when housing action areas have been set out formal notices have to be issued to everyone involved. The Minister has said that he will ensure that these notices are in language which is as simple as possible, but I have seen many attempts to put notices into sensible, simple language. When elderly people get notices through their door, many of them immediately panic, thinking that their rights are to be affected. Often they discuss the matter with people who do not know the facts. This frequently causes a great deal of worry and confusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No matter how much the Minister tries to have the notices simply worded, the moment people receive them much alarm and despondency may be caused. People will want to know how the consideration of a housing action area will affect them, what their rights are and what they will get in the way of rehousing and compensation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only satisfactory way to deal with this is to have a public meeting, to tell people to go along to the local school or to the local Conservative rooms, where officials will be present to answer questions. I do not necessarily suggest that councillors should speak at these meetings. They could by all means sit in on the meetings, but councillors can be tempted to indicate their special interest in the matter, and we want to have present officials who will simply tell people the facts—not to say that a scheme is hopeless or is wonderful, or to claim that Glasgow or Lanarkshire are succeeding in their housing objectives, but merely to tell people how the proposals will affect them and to tell them about
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>80</span>
their rights regarding compensation and rehousing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am convinced that a public meeting is the way to tackle this. The Minister may say that he hopes that most sensible local authorities will hold public meetings. No doubt some would try to do so, but there should be a firm statutory obligation on local authorities to hold public meetings in nearby halls. There may be cases where there is not a conveniently-situated hall. In such cases, local authorities should have power to hire buses to take people to a hall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps there should be not just one public meeting in each case—perhaps meetings should be held on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, in case people have to attend meetings of other organisations on particular evenings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Public meetings are needed even if only 40 people are involved—although 100 or 200 people may be affected. If notices are issued telling people that their houses may be demolished or improved, or that they may be rehoused—it may not be known where—this will mean maximum concern and confusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned here with a delicate situation which affects many elderly people. There must be a firm guarantee in the Bill that public meetings will be held and that everyone affected will be invited to the meetings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment. To a large extent, we are dealing with elderly people, but even younger people have great difficulty with many of the forms and notices sent to them nowadays. No matter how simple we try to keep these documents, they must of necessity contain a certain amount of information or advice which is difficult for the average person to follow. At a time when we are trying to impress that local government must not be remote but must be brought to the people, this type of amendment is needed. Indeed, I would like to see such an obligation included in many other pieces of legislation, particularly those dealing with planning matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No matter how much communication there is with people through the post, nothing can replace the personal touch of local officials presenting themselves and explaining in detail to the people exactly what is involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0063">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>81</span>
The Minister may suggest that Clause 19 (6) could cover this matter in that the Secretary of State
	<br><blockquote><p>'…may prescribe different requirements for the different resolutions'.</p></blockquote>
I accept that the matter is reasonably left open to the Secretary of State, but nowhere is it insistent that a public meeting be held for the purpose of explanation. We again deal with the point which I made earlier—and I am sorry to hark back to the matter—that often in housing legislation we tend to concentrate very much on cities and to forget the circumstances which prevail in rural areas. In some rural areas the village hall is virtually the centre of the community. I accept that circumstances vary, but the village hall is often the obvious place in which to gather people together and to explain fully what is intended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will seriously consider this matter. If the wording of the amendment is not exactly to his or his draftsmen's liking, perhaps he will give us some assurance that he will bear the matter in mind and offer something on Report which will satisfy us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I too support my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor). I appreciate that an important point of principle is involved and that it may be that this matter could be regarded as creating a precedent. If that were so, I would all the more enthusiastically support the amendment. I believe that it involves a principle which offers great advantages, as my hon. Friend the Member for Ross and Cromarty (Mr. Gray) has said, in that it will include other areas in the political arena.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One reason for there being resistance to this kind of approach is that officials sometimes fear that they may get in public a bloody nose or a red face. They prefer to keep themselves in more comfortable places so that they do not have to deal directly with the public. In my view, that is a totally unfounded fear. If officials took part in public meetings—and on occasions they have done so in my constituency—they would find that rather than causing further difficulty or exacerbating feelings a situation would often be created in which they would be able to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>82</span>
remove totally unfounded fears. As a result, it would often be possible to reach a speedier conclusion than if the meeting had not taken place. We are anxious to see that speedy action is taken in carrying out the intention of the Bill. I believe that this amendment, far from slowing progress, would positively speed it up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a lot of sympathy with the amendment. However, I believe that it would be extremely difficult to write this kind of provision into the Bill, to get it exactly right and to be sure that it met every kind of circumstance. For example, if a housing action area took over a small number of houses, a public meeting would hardly be an appropriate vehicle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I undertake that when the Bill comes into force we shall stress, in the guidance which is issued to local authorities, the importance of having in most circumstances some kind of public participation—principally, I think, by the media and by public meetings. I believe that to go further and write such a provision into the Bill would be a considerable drafting task. Nevertheless, I should like to consider the matter. Therefore, I invite the honourable Gentleman to withdraw the amendment. If that is done I shall consider the matter and write to the honourable Gentleman before Report. I shall consider whether such a provision can go in the Bill. I fear that this will not be possible, but I do not dispute the objective that the honourable Gentleman has in mind. If that course is taken it will be open to Conservative hon. Members to table suitable amendments on Report. Although selection is not for me, I should be glad to have another opportunity to discuss this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could not recommend to the Committee that they accept the amendment as it stands. I do not think that it is properly drafted. I do not wish to mislead the Committee into thinking that I can see a way of putting the terms of this amendment into the Bill. Nonetheless, I am sympathetic to the idea. If I fail to find a way of inserting it in the Bill before Report I shall let the honourable Gentleman know. We can then return to the matter on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friends and I regard this as an important point of principle which should be in the Bill.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>83</span>
has succeeded in finding a way of doing so. In view of the Minister's helpful advice, I shall be glad to ask the Committee's leave to withdraw. On the strict understanding that if the Minister cannot insert this principle we shall discuss the matter again on Report, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This amendment will have the effect of allowing the Secretary of State to prescribe the notices under Clause 19 (5) (	<i>a</i>) and (	<i>b</i>). I think that this amendment will be acceptable to the Committee because obviously the Committee is anxious that the Secretary of State should prescribe the way in which the notices are given so that they can be of maximum assistance to the people who are affected by them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should be clear what we are doing by inserting this provision. We are not encouraging local authorities to take the whole three months to make up their minds. We are saying that if they do not make up their minds, then the whole matter lapses after three months. We
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>84</span>
want to remove the uncertainty that hangs over people's heads as to whether or not a local authority will go ahead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we change the provision from three months to two months we shall, in effect, be speeding up the procedure. We shall reduce the uncertainty in the way that I have indicated. I think that there has been the general feeling in Committee, which was expressed on Second Reading, that the period was perhaps an encouragement, as the Bill is drafted, to take rather longer than we would like to see. Therefore, it would be an improvement to reduce the period for the reasons that I have mentioned. I recommend that the Committee should accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

find no difficulty in accepting. If a small housing action area is created in somewhere like Yoker and the whole of Drumchapel is drawn into it, for example, there would be a need to insert in the clause the principle behind the amendment. I hope that the Minister will feel able to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that I cannot recommend—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Milian</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am getting into dangerous territory. On the whole, I prefer to deal with amendments on their merits. In this case I am afraid that the merits are against the amendment. It is not intended to enable a local authority to acquire large pieces of land and property contiguous to a housing action area. There are already safeguards against that. For example, if a local authority tried to do that by agreement, then by definition it would have to have the agreement of the sellers. In that event, there would be no real difficulty because the authority could no doubt purchase the land even without this provision. If an authority were going to do so compulsorily, then there are all the protections involved in a compulsory purchase order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The more important consideration is that there are circumstances in which a housing action area may, for example, be adjacent to a number of cleared sites. The cleared sites might be considerably larger than the housing action area. It would make a good deal of sense from a local authority's point of view and from the point of view of the community that in such circumstances the authority should acquire the contiguous land. It may be that in such circumstances the owners would be happy that the authority should acquire the land round about so as to give it a parcel of land which would be a sensible area if demolition and redevelopment were to take place. I think it is necessary to leave that element of flexibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole power is circumscribed by the words in lines 33 to 36:
	<br><blockquote><p>'if the acquisition is reasonably necessary for the purpose of securing an area of convenient shape and dimensions or is reasonably necessary for the satisfactory development or use of the housing action area'.</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>86</span>
Having put in those words, we have sufficiently circumscribed the powers of the local authority. To try to lay down another qualification related to the area of the land, which I agree in most circumstances may be perfectly sensible, would in certain circumstances not be sensible as it would devalue the useful additional power which the clause will give to local authorities. Therefore, I cannot recommend the Committee to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the Minister's example is helping his argument. He talked about the possibility of an extensive area of reclaimed land. Whether it is reclaimed land, farming land or speculative land makes no difference. The Minister is saying that there might be a substantial area of land available for housing near to the housing action area and that somehow that land can be acquired on the basis of this measure. I do not follow why that should be the case. I think that the opposite should be true. If there is a large area of vacant land, it is up to the local authority to acquire it for the purpose of building houses under legislation, if it wishes. The land should not be brought into a housing action area. That would extend the scope of the Bill beyond what is intended of it, which is to improve the situation in areas where action is needed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not happy with the provision either, because it could be open to abuse. We have said:
	<br><blockquote><p>'relatively small in relation to the size of the housing action area'.</p></blockquote>
If there is a large parcel of land nearby, it should not be dealt with under housing action area proposals. We are a little suspicious of the clause. My hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot recommend acceptance of the amendment.

The amendment would limit the time available to an owner of a house which is to be improved in a housing action area to apply to the local authority for a loan. The local authority representatives feel that there should be a limit. By setting a limit of nine months we are giving every opportunity to the owner who wants a loan to make the application. There is no question of his having to rush, but the amendment will prevent proceedings being dragged out unnecessarily, to the detriment of local authority administration.
