This is a drafting amendment, which I hope that the Committee will accept. It substitutes the wording used in Section 12(1) of the Mental Health (Scotland) Act, to which Clause 1(1)(	<i>b</i>) of the Bill refers, in place of the present less appropriate wording which originated from the Education (Mentally Handicapped Children) Act 1970. It does not change the effect of Clause 1(1)(	<i>b</i>), which removes from social work authorities their present obligation to provide for mentally handicapped children in day care centres.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 2, in page 2, line 5, leave out 'that a child required special education'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a drafting amendment required because of an error in printing which was not picked up in time. These words are not appropriate, because Section 63(1)(ii) of the Education (Scotland) Act 1962, to which these words refer, relates to the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
ascertainment of children as being unsuitable for education or training and not to decisions that a child requires special education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This is a drafting amendment. It is necessary in order to avoid the necessity of reciting the full title of the Education (Scotland) Act 1962.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill is of relatively restricted scope but of considerable social value. It is also, I am confident, a Bill which will command the support of the whole Committee. All parties have already signified their approval, as is indicated by those who have sponsored the Bill with me. Indeed, the last Government gave their full support to an almost identical measure which was to have been introduced by the hon. Member for Midlothian (Mr. Eadie) but which became a casualty at the last election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel privileged now to have the opportunity of conducting this Bill through Parliament, and I should like to reiterate my appreciation of the co-operation which I recived from the Scottish Office while I was drafting my Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The objectives at which the Bill is aimed are derived from the Melville Report published last year and entitled "The Training of Staff for Centres for the Mentally Handicapped". The report has many aspects, most of which do not require legislation and are not in question here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Briefly, the situation to which the Bill is addressed is that under the Scottish Education Acts there is a general duty on parents to educate their children and a duty on education authorities to provide facilities for education which together result in a universal education system. When a child is handicapped in some way—for example, if he or she is blind or deaf—so as to be unable to benefit from ordinary education, the authority must provide special education suited to the child's capacity and needs. This extends to mental as well as physical handicap.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0008">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
For the majority of mentally handicapped children, the education authority provides, first, special schools and special classes in ordinary schools, and, secondly, if the children are too handicapped to be able to benefit from that kind of education, junior occupational centres, which are really a kind of special school where something more appropriately called training is available. I emphasise that the Bill now before the Committee has nothing to do wtih any of these children for whom education or training suited to their capacity is already being provided by education authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are, however, children who are very severely mentally handicapped or who have a mental illness such that those two kinds of special provision are unsuitable. These children, under the present law, represent one of the very few exceptions to the rule of universal education. One of two things may happen to them. They may be hospitalised and become virtually long-term patients in a mental or mental deficiency hospital, or they may go through the process of ascertainment, which is laid down for all handicapped children, and be classified as too disabled to be suitable for education or training of any kind. In both cases, they cease to be the responsibility of the education authority. They are excluded from the education system. In the former cased, the health board becomes responsible and, in the latter, the social work authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The education authority has power, which most education authorities now exercise, but no duty, to provide education for the farmer group, but for the latter it has neither duty nor power. Children in the latter group are given places in day care centres, many of which are provided and staffed by voluntary organisations on behalf of the social work departments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one doubts the kindness and patience these children receive, but the emphasis is on nursing care and basic social training. Some of those who look after these children have had special training, but regrettably they comprise only a small number.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recently had the opportunity of visiting the Willowbrae day care centre in Edinburgh where I was most impressed by both the staff and the children. I should like to pay a tribute to those
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
dedicated people whose work so often goes unnoticed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The number of children with which the Bill is concerned is not very large—the Melville Committee estimated that in 1972 there were about 700 attending day care centres and about 1,200 in hospital—but if it is the case that more can be done for them than at present, even that number is extremely serious, and that is the whole point of the present exercise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have it on good authority from educationists and experts in the development of children's minds that the care they are getting, devoted and understanding as it is, falls short of the potential of at least some of them. No one supposes that these children can receive education in the sense in which we normally use the word. They cannot be taught to read and they cannot be taught to write. But that does not mean that they must simply be written off as incapable of any development. Programmes and techniques now exist, and are being explored and extended, which can appreciably increase their awareness of themselves and their response to the world in which they live.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is no small matter. The gain can be very worth while relative to the child's condition. One does not need to be a specialist to appreciate the difference between a child who lies staring at the ceiling when its name is spoken and one which turns its head, and, even if the child cannot speak, smiles back.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most hon. Members know only too well the despair of parents when they feel that something more could be done for their children, and if an improvement in potential achievement is provided for even a small number of children in any constituency, this Bill is surely worth while. I can testify from the many parents who have contacted me that they certainly favour this measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to make a long speech, nor do I believe that one is necessary. The object is simple, and the Bill is short. The whole essence is in Clause 1, which empowers the Secretary of State to appoint a day on which two things will happen. First, the ascertainment of children as unsuitable for education and training will come to an end, and existing ascertainments to that end will be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0009">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
cancelled. Secondly, the responsibility for the training both of the children who hitherto would have been so ascertained and of children in mental and mental deficiency hospitals will devolve on the education authorities. That is the essence of the Bill. The rest is consequential or formal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, however, one consequence of which I should sneak. Hon. Members may wonder how the staff who look after these children at present will be affected by the change. There are, I understand, at present important issues in this area arising from other parts of the Melville Report which are under consideration. My Bill does not touch these. The staff affected by the Bill fall mainly into three categories—those employed by social work departments in day care centres; those employed by voluntary bodies in day care centres and those employed as teachers in hospitals. All of these will be transferred to the education authorities and there is no reason to fear that their terms or conditions of service will be worsened. I understand that there is no apprehension among those directly concerned. But as a precaution the Bill provides power for the Secretary of State to protect their interests in various ways by order which he would place before Parliament. I do not visualise that this power will need to be exercised, but it is available if needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How quickly the new kind of approach to the development of these children can be adopted is not directly a matter for me. I can see that its full achievement may be a gradual, though I certainly hope not an unduly gradual, process. Perhaps we can be told something about that, either now, when the Under-Secretary speaks, or later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will say only this. Until this legislation has been passed, there is no onus on anyone to set the wheels in motion. From contacts I have made I believe that the progress now envisaged—so very welcome to the parents of the children concerned, as represented by the Scottish Society for Mentally Handicapped Children—is by no means unwelcome to the education authorities. They recognise that there is work for them to do and they are ready to do it but the preparation for the change will not begin in any
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
practical sense until we have put the Bill on the Statute Book. I therefore invite the Committee to approve Clause 1</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to follow the hon. Member for Ross and Cromarty (Mr. Gray) and I begin by complimenting and congratulating him on bringing this measure forward. As he rightly said, it was proposed during the last Parliament by my hon. Friend the Member for Midlothian (Mr. Eadie) that such a measure should be brought forward and there was an indication that the previous Government would give their wholehearted support to such a measure. This Bill will be seen by parents of the children who will be affected by the measures envisaged in it as marking a milestone for those children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of these parents have hitherto found it very difficult, if not impossible, to understand why their children can be brought to such an advanced stage by instructors in occupational centres and day care centres in the field of remedial occupations and such like, yet not be allowed to go to a school and be educated to the limits of their capabilities. I am delighted that this measure is being brought forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I think it right and proper to say that while we shall be resolving some problems there is no doubt that we will be creating some problems also, because we are now entering a new field where we are seeking to combine two skills, and this will be a very difficult thing which will require a great deal of willpower both on the part of the Government and of those concerned in this amalgamation. It will not be easy to combine the skill and devoted care of the instructor in the occupational centre with the educational skill that is necessary in the exercise of the new function.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also true—it would be wrong to deceive ourselves into believing Otherwise—that concern is being expressed among instructors in occupational centres and day care centres that their status or importance will be reduced because of the measures that are being introduced in the Bill. I do not accept this, because I am one of the sponsors of this Bill. But it is our duty, as the politicians involved, to reassure
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0010">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
those people that this is not our intention and that it will not be the case when the Bill becomes an Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hitherto, as the hon. Member for Ross and Cromarty said, there has been categorisation of these children, and overriding all these categories has been the prevailing belief that all these people were ineducable. This is one sphere in which we in Scotland are behind the times. Scotland is one, if not the only, European country that has taken this view for so long. It seems regrettable that a country with such a progressive educational outlook as Scotland, has taken so long to realise that nobody is ineducable and these children should be allowed to develop to their full potential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I do not think that it is necessary to speak at length on this measure. There is a wide acceptance of all that is proposed in the Bill and I am delighted to give my support to it and to welcome it as presented today, particularly Clause 1.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The whole Committee will wish to join the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Harry Ewing) in congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for Ross and Cromarty (Mr. Gray) on introducing the Bill and on explaining its purpose so excellently and succinctly. I was impressed also by the skill which my hon. Friend—a Whip—showed in managing to make a Second Reading speech on the Question, "That the Clause stand part of the Bill". I was pleased because the Bill went through quite properly, on the nod, downstairs. This is the first opportunity we have had to hear my hon. Friend explain the purpose of his Bill, and I am grateful for what he said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill marks an important step forward along the road on which the Melville Report is a milestone and I welcome it for another reason, that it is another demonstration of the way in which social work of all kinds in Scotland is very advanced. I remember that one of the most pleasurable occasions for me in the House was to take part in the debates on the Social Work (Scotland) Bill, in which, I think, both parties can take great satisfaction. The only pity of the position today is that the staffing of the social work departments is often inadequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
It is on the matter of staffing that I wish to address some questions to my hon. Friend. Subsection (2) makes clear—my hon. Friend emphasised this—that the Secretary of State will have power to do whatever he thinks
	<br><blockquote><p>"necessary or expedient … for the protection of the interests of persons who before the appointed day have been employed for the purpose of functions of health boards or local authorities".</p></blockquote>
I understood from my hon. Friend that he expected the Bill to take effect gradually over a period of years. I am sure that that is right. I do not think that one can make a sudden, sharp change in the organisation and management of day care centres and later, no doubt, occupational centres too, in view of the delicate nature of the work they do. This has to be a gradual process, and the process pointed to in the Bill is one which I welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there is a certain amount of understandable worry among instructresses working with mentally handicapped children in Scotland. The message of the Melville Report and of my hon. Friend this morning, as I understood it, was that qualified teachers would gradually take over the instructing role in day care centres and in occupational centres. The report makes this clear in paragraph 76—
	<br><blockquote><p>"We have already concluded that both day care centres and junior occupational centres require the services of teachers".</p></blockquote>
The reasons for that conclusion are spelled out earlier, in paragraphs 51 and 57.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no quarrel with that finding, but I am concerned about the effect of this change on instructresses who have worked devotedly for many years with mentally handicapped children. I accept that one wants in every possible way to push forward the limited horizon of capability for the mentally handicapped child, and it may well be that a teacher, specially trained—I emphasise that—may sometimes in the long term be able to achieve a little more than an instructress. But I am not positive about that. I recently saw a child who, under the loving care of an instructress in an occupational centre, has made a quite remarkable breakthrough and is now able to receive more normal education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The instructresses see that teachers coming into the profession alongside them are better paid and have—as I noted from at least one advertisement I read in a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0011">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
Scottish newspaper the other day—the prospect of larger responsibility payments. This seems perhaps a little unfair. The instructresses in many cases have been there for a long time. They have the training which is gained by experience and they are devoted people, It is especially important in this field that we should take particular care to make certain that they are reasonably and fairly treated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, may I ask my hon. Friend to bear in mind—I do not ask for a positive answer now—the importance of the training which these teachers will receive. I do not believe, although I do not claim to be more than a layman in these matters, that the normal training that teachers receive makes them in any way specially qualified to cope with the problems of mentally backward children, My hon. Friend himself poignantly described some of the difficulties which confront teachers and instructresses in the day care and junior occupational centres. Indeed, the Melville Report itself in paragraph 78 calls attention to the importance of training:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Up to the present, very few Scottish teachers have had experience of education of the severely mentally handicapped and there are no training courses designed for teachers wishing to specialise in this field. We recommend that such courses should be introduced."</p></blockquote>
Having said that I welcome the Bill and that I applaud everything my hon. Friend has said, I think that it would be unwise for us to embark on this change until we are completely satisfied that proper training will be available for teachers coming into this field. Perhaps the Minister would be good enough to comment on this question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Bill. I congratulate my hon. Friend most warmly on introducing it and on the skill and care with which he has spoken today. But I hope that he will be able to say a little more himself, or through my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) on the Front Bench, about the protection which I seek for the instructresses who have served these children so well in the past.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join with my hon. Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) and the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) in congratulat-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
ing my hon. Friend the Member for Ross and Cromarty (Mr. Gray) on presenting this important Bill. It may be small in size but it is most important in its application for the future. It concerns a subject which has been discussed for many years, and highlighted in the Melville Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Melville Committee was set up by the present Secretary of State for Scotland to report on the training of staff in this field, particularly for occupational centres and day care centres, for both children and adults. The committee was asked to report on training, but it rightly decided after looking at the subject that it was most important to examine the purposes of the centres in relation to what development ought to take place. This is set out in Chapter IV of Melville. The committee came to the early conclusion that no child is untrainable or ineducable. This recommendation is the heart of the Bill and forms the substance of Clause 1, which repeals the various sections of the Education Act which categorised children as ineducable, and said that they had to be looked after by social work committees or, now, by area health boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, that is only a part of Melville; we must not overlook that. I merely wish to set out the history of the Bill in view of comments that have appeared in certain papers. Melville reported well over a year ago, but by last summer it was obvious, while discussions were going on with many associations and authorities involved, that this part of the recommendation affecting handicapped children could be drafted into a small Bill last autumn. This my Departmentas it then was—was very glad to do, with the hope that a Scottish Member would draw a high position in the Ballot last November. That in fact happened, and we were delighted to ask the hon. Member for Midlothian (Mr. Eadie) if he would bring this Bill to the House as a Private Member's Bill and subsequently, we hoped, to the First Scottish Standing Committee, as we are today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Midlothian was most helpful, and we drafted the Bill. Had there not been an election, the Bill would have been presented by him in March and, no doubt, by now would
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0012">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
have become an Act. I say that because the education correspondent of the '	<i>Scotsman,</i> who has written at some length about the Bill, indicated that the Government should not receive any credit for Bills which they are not seen to be getting on with. Perhaps I am in collusion here with the Under-Secretary, because he is in exactly the same situation as I was then. I feel it wrong that that should be the accepted attitude.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scottish Members of Parliament have always accepted that, in view of the amount of legislation in the Scottish Grand Committee and the First Standing Committee, Bills that were non-controversial and generally accepted could proceed through the House of Commons muck quicker by Private Member's Bills. My hon. Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) and the hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow (Dr. Mabon) know that only too well over recent years. It is wrong to criticise this system. I give my full support to my hon. Friend the Member for Ross and Cromarty (Mr. Gray) for his Bill, and I hope it will have a speedy passage through its remaining stages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people in Scotland may be wondering what is happening to the major part of the Melville Report, which has been the subject of Questions over many months. The Under-Secretary may tell us what he has in mind. However, it should be put on record that consultations went on all through last year, and at the time the previous Government left office we were still awaiting the last observations from the General Teaching Council. But in any event it was, in my view, impossible for legislation or major decisions to be made until the next Parliamentary Session, beginning as it would have done in October. There was no delay on the part of the previous Government or the present Government in implementing further action on Melville, because this autumn was the time when it should take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only matters I should like to put to the Under-Secretary are for information rather than as any form of criticism. There may be some fault in the mechanics of HANSARD or in the provision of Written Answers which I had down for yesterday, because I have neither received them through the post nor read them in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
HANSARD. They referred to the matter raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire about qualifications and training.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first matter—this is really a joint question to the Under-Secretary and to my hon. Friend the Member for Ross and Cromarty—is as to their thoughts on the appointed day. I and other hon. Members are not too happy about the amount of enthusiasm being shown by education authorities towards developments in this area. We want to see a change of attitude and far greater enthusiasm towards preparing the places that will be required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend mentioned qualifications of instructresses and teachers. Of course, Melville stressed that it was not the availability of instructors that caused it concern but their qualifications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I, too, would like confirmation that those who are now employed in special schools, junior occupation centres and day centres will be protected in their future employment, both as regards the employment itself and their salary structure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Has consideration been given to the recommendation in paragraph 74 of Melville that these schools and centres might in future have a terminology bringing in the word "school"? I think that that would clarify the position, since there must be some muddle in the mind of the lay public as to when we are talking about special schools and junior occupational centres and when about day centres.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, I pay a tribute—which, I am sure, is echoed by all hon. Members —to the Scottish Society for Mentally Handicapped Children. This organisation is of immense value as both a national and a local organisation. In all our constituencies the local branches do tremendous work and deserve all credit not only for what they do from day to day to help handicapped children but for the way they have pressed authorities and Governments to take action in this field.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The greatest tribute that could be paid to the SSMHC would be for the education authorities to buckle down to this problem at the earliest possible moment and accept that Members of Parliament and all involved with mentally handicapped children want to see the position of those children improved and we want
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0013">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
to see help and guidance available to the parents whenever possible. If all this goes ahead as speedily as is practicable within the educational and financial resources of the country, all of us will be very pleased. I wish the Bill as speedy a passage as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Adam Hunter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to reiterate what has been said by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee, but since the hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) said that it would take some time before much of the Bill could be implemented, and it was said also that both Europe and England are well ahead of us in this area of education, I should like to know what kind of comparison we can make between England and Scotland in this regard. What achievements have been made in England in this branch of education?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is an important question to ask at this time since we did not have a debate on Second Reading and no debate —which we should have had—on the Melville Report. I should be glad to know how far ahead England is in this regard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Robert Hughes)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I add my congratulations to the hon. Member for Ross and Cromarty (Mr. Gray) on bringing this Bill forward. The Government welcomes it without reservation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) has said, there has been a great deal of co-operation between successive Governments and successive private Members about bringing the Bill forward. In saying that, I wish in no way to detract from the efforts of the hon. Member for Ross and Cromarty in using his place in the Ballot. There is common ground between us here, but had no Scottish Member drawn a place in the Ballot—or drawn a place and been unwilling to take up this matter—whichever Government were in power would probably have brought a Bill forward themselves, despite the legislative difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Ross and Cromarty said, the Bill is relatively simple but very important. The views expressed on both sides of the Committee today show that there is a great desire in Scotland for this kind of measure to come
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
forward, and it will be warmly welcomed throughout the country. Its objectives are limited to the transfer of responsibility for the relatively small number of children involved from social work committees to the education authorities. It creates a duty for education authorities to give education to children in mental and mental deficiency hospitals, which many of them do already.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill arises from the Melville Report. Comment has been made this morning about that report and its wider implications. The Bill takes care of the first four recommendations in paragraphs 124(1) to (4).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Questions have been raised about the occupational centres. In passing, may I say that I am sorry that the hon. Member for Dumfries has not had his Questions answered. I do not know what has happened but I shall find out and write to the hon. Gentleman. I appreciate his concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill does not really affect the running or Staffing of junior occupational centres. Nevertheless, I appreciate hon. Members' concern about what will happen to the staff of the junior occupational centres and the day care centres, and the kind of 'training that will be provided. It is a pity that some instructresses or instructors—I am not sure of the correct phrase—should feel that, as a result of the changeover and the desire that teachers should come into these centres, 'their status will be diminished and their work will no longer be appreciated—not that it is appreciated properly now, but 'they feel 'that it will be less appreciated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That fear may arise from the proposition in paragraph 84 of the Melville Report suggesting that the existing instructors should be known as "assistants". I think that it was a little 'ham-fisted of the committee to express it in that way. It suggests some less regard for the people concerned. I realise that there are difficulties and that the Melville Committee found it hard to arrive at the correct designation. Whether the designation should be "superior" or remain as instructor is a matter that we can discuss later, but I assure the Committee that there is no intention to diminish the responsibilities or the good work of the present instructors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0014">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
One knows that there have been difficulties. The views of the General Teaching Council for Scotland were sought about whether special consideration might be given 'Ito the registration of teachers Who spend part of their probation period in junior occupational centres or day care centres, and second, whether individual instructors in junior occupational centres might be given recognition as teachers. In both cases, the GTC decided that normal conditions for the registration of teachers should apply. It means that very few of the existing instructors can expect to achieve the status of qualified teachers right away. The GTC's decision was ratified in March, and it is against this background that we should consider the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have asked the colleges of education to consider the training needs of teachers who might work with severely mentally handicapped children. We are also considering the training needs of instructors and the kind of course that would best meet these needs. Consideration of these issues is well advanced, but I am not in a position to tell the Committee today exactly what the training facilities or courses will be. I expect to be in a position to make an announcement fairly soon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the existing instructors in junior occupational centres will be disappointed by the GTC decision. Many were hoping that they would be recognised as teachers. That seems unlikely, and it is a matter over which the Government have no control. It is a matter for the GTC. The Government intend to have consultations with the staff concerned in the hope of reaching a balanced view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been discussion about the appointed day. I am sure that we all hope that it will be as soon as possible. At present, there are certain time difficulties in view of the imminent changeover in local authorities, which we are consulting about the appointed day and not all of which have yet submitted their views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are certain constraints in view of the reorganisation of local government, which becomes effective on 16th May 1975. It would be inappropriate, land certainly undesirable, to transfer staff at this time from social work departments to education departments
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
and then in May 1975 from education departments to the regional authorities. Then there is the problem of the different size of education authorities and social work departments in the large burghs, countries and cities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think—especially as it will mean a fair amount of property transfer—that there is a strong pointer towards 16th May 1975 as the appointed day, but we shall make no final decision until the consultations are finished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the suggested date of 16th May 1975 is not interpreted as meaning that nothing will happen until then. There is much scope for investigation for forward planning, which can go on. We shall have to arrange for child guidance staff to go to the various day care centres and, perhaps, into hospitals to assess how best these children can benefit from the new education provision to be provided for them. The preparatory work can, therefore, continue—I hope that it does—during the intervening period, whenever the appointed day might be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the good will existing, I have no doubt that this Bill will become law. It will then give a stimulus to the educational development and forward planning which is needed. That there has been no statutory duty on education authorities in the past has led to there not being the education we want to provide. The Bill will provide great stimulus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dumfries asked what the new centres should be called. Once the Bill is enacted, the appointed day is decided and the transfer is made, the day centres will become special schools. Whether the use of the title special school is appropriate will have to be considered. I take his point that the term "school" should be in the title to emphasise the educational provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline (Mr. Hunter) asked for comparisons between England and Wales and Scotland. The Education (Handicapped Children) Act 1970, the English and Welsh Act preceding this Bill, came into operation in 1971. They have had training courses for teachers specialising in work with the severely mentally handicapped since 1970, and education programmes based on research mainly carried out in Manchester have been
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0015">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
developed in English schools for the mentally handicapped.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Steady progress has been made by many mentally handicapped children, particularly in social independence within the community, and there is no doubt that, as a result of a different system in Scotland, we are behind in the provision made for these children. I have not the information available to make accurate comparisons. Indeed, I do not know whether they can be made. I can only say that we wish Clause 1 to stand part and that the remaining stages will go through as quickly as possible. We shall certainly do all that we can to see that forward planning takes place so that there will be no hiatus once the appointed day comes. We all want to see this change and the children concerned getting the benefits of education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude by again congratulating the hon. Member for Ross and Cromarty for his efforts. I am sure that he and other Members who have taken part in the debate will not regard the passing of the Bill as the end of the exercise but will continue to discuss the whole matter and ensure that progress is maintained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Under-Secretary of State for his help and for the way in which he very kindly dealt with a great many of the questions which were put to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) for his contribution and support. Some of the points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) have already been answered, but perhaps I may assure him further on the staff question. The Bill provides for the conservation of the terms and conditions of the staff in day care centres. The staff are at present exercising a caring function. There will be a continuing need for this work and I do not foresee any radical change in the status and function of the staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Matrons in charge of centres may have particular misgivings about their future. In my view, there will be a continued need for them as matrons, as there are in other schools for handicapped children, especially in view of the large element of care, as distinct from educational training
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
programmes, needed by these children. Their function will be much as at present. The education aspect will be an additional component in the operation of the centres. I hope that the change to an educational role will add interest to the work of the staff as new educational programmes are developed and introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that many years ago a few of the staff in the centres attended a course which was provided for them at Jordanhill College of Education. There has, however, been no specific course of training for the staff of day care centres for many years. Training for staff was proposed in the Melville Report, and I was glad to hear the Under-Secretary's comments about this. The Government have it very much in mind and will be doing all they can to encourage the centres to provide suitable training.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer next to the Under-Secretary's remarks about the appointed day. I am reassured to hear that the Government are aiming for May 1975. I accept that, with the changeover to regional authorities, it is difficult to be specific about the date, but, if it could be achieved by May 1975, I am sure that that would meet with general approval.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dunfermline (Mr. Hunter) asked about a comparison with England and Wales. Although—like the Under-Secretary—I am unable to give specific facts and figures, I can state that as far as the staff are concerned the changeover has been absolutely harmonious. There has been no trouble, and I believe that that augurs well for the situation in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) for taking part in the debate and for the help he has given me on this matter. I do not think I can deal with any of the points he raised more effectively than the Under-Secretary already has, and again I thank him for doing that part of my work for me.
