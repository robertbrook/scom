	<div class='legislation'>DRAFT ELECTRICITY (BORROWING POWERS) (SCOTLAND) ORDER 1974</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Mr. Bruce Millan)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee have considered the draft instrument.</p></blockquote>
The draft order would raise the limit on the borrowing powers of the Scottish Electricity Boards from its present level of £950 million to £1,200 million, the maximum provided for in Section 47(7) of the Electricity Act 1947 as amended by the Electricity Act 1972. This limit applies to the combined total of the outstanding borrowings of the two Scottish electricity boards, including any borrowing from abroad and any temporary borrowings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The explanatory memorandum which was published with the Electricity Bill, which became the Electricity Act 1972, explained that the purpose of inserting the interim limit of £950 million in the Bill was to ensure that Parliament would have an opportunity of reviewing the progress of the electricity industry in Scotland within two or three years. By the end of May this year, outstanding borrowings by the Scottish electricity boards stood at £870 million, with a considerable amount of borrowing in prospect during the next few months. That means that we have to take action now to increase the limit. Hon. Members will note that this debate is taking place at about the time that was forecast in 1972.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have two separate electricity boards in Scotland, but we have a joint borrowing limit. The reason is that this assists the joint planning and operation of the two Scottish electricity supply systems. Hon. Members who were here at the time, and perhaps others as well, will remember the recommendation of the Mackenzie Committee in 1962 that the two boards should be amalgamated. But there was
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
a strong feeling then, as there is now, that they should be maintained as separate electricity boards, and that is the present position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, in order to achieve the most economic development of generating capacity in Scotland, planning is considered and undertaken jointly by the boards on the recommendation of a joint planning committee. The systems themselves are linked so that we have, to a considerable extent, an overall Scottish system instead of two separate s.), stems. Because generating capacity gives rise to such a large proportion of the need for borrowing by the Scottish boards, we have a joint financial limit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we increase, as I hope we shall through this order, the limit to £1,200 million, it may be asked how long the new limit will last. The rate of increase in electricity demand has been lower than was expected at the time of the passing of the Electricity Act 1972. Demand will be further affected by the recent increase in electricity prices, among other things. Forecasting of future electricity demand in Scotland is particularly difficult in present circumstances. It is not only that electricity prices have gone up; oil prices have, too. There is always the overall economic situation to take into account, and there is a particularly difficult energy situation not only in Britain but world-wide to be considered. As an indication of the kind of changes in forecasts that have already been made by the electricity boards in Scotland, perhaps I should tell the Committee that the load estimate for the winter of 1977–78, which was 8,607 MW, as shown in the brochure "Plans for the Future 1971–1978 "published with the 1972 bill, has now been reduced to about 7,700 MW.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not possible, however, to reflect the reduction in demand as forecast in a reduction in the present power station construction programme, since so much of it is already in train. The construction of the third set at Inverkip, an oil-fired generating station, was advanced by one year by the previous Government as one of the measures taken to improve employment in Scotland in the years 197–73 and 1973–74. The construction of Peterhead power station, an oil and/or gas-fired station, has had to be held to its timetable because of the local need for power, which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0442">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
is particularly acute in the North-East, especially as industrial and other demands increase, owing to North Sea oil development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The boards therefore expect that in 1978 there will be a larger than usual margin of generating plant, and when the Peterhead station is completed in 1979 no further additional capacity will be required before 1982. As a result, despite price increases, particularly for fuel stocks, the new borrowinig limit of £1,200 million is still expected to last until well into 1977–78.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall mention some of the other projects that are under construction at present. In the North Board's district the pumped storage scheme at Foynes is expected to be fully operational by the end of the year. A good start has been made on the new oil and gas dual-fired station at Peterhead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the South area, as hon. Members will be aware, there have been considerable problems in the construction of the AGR nuclear station at Hunterston B, including modifications necessary as a result of corrosion experienced in the earlier Magnox stations at Hunterston A. These various difficulties have delayed the completion of the station. Similar problems have been encountered by the CEGB south of the border, but the board now hopes to feed electricity into the grid from Hunterston B by the end of this year, and to have both reactors operational from next year. Further up the Clyde, the large oil-fired generating station at Inverkip is progressing satisfactorily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The boards are planning further ahead although no further stations will need to be commissioned before 1982. As the Committee knows, suitable sites for power stations are scarce, partly because so few locations can meet the strict physical requirements, but also because power stations raise in an acute form considerations of amenity and environment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The boards are, therefore, looking as far ahead as possible to identify suitable sites and are setting in motion the formal procedures for their approval. Three such sites in the South Board's area are the subject of applications before the Secretary of State: at Carriden near Bo'ness—where there has already been a public
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
inquiry—for a dual oil and gas-fired station; at Torness Point near Dunbar, where the public inquiry is still in operation; and Chapeldonan near Girvan, where there has yet to be an inquiry. In the latter two cases, they are sites for nuclear stations. There is also an application covering the installation of a fourth generating unit at Inverkip.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The board's purpose in making these applications well in advance of the requirement for these stations is to build up a bank of sites which would give a choice of sites and a choice of fuel and take into account the geographical distribution of the sites that might be required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ought to make clear here, as I did in our debate last Thursday in the Scottish Grand Committee, that even if the sites are cleared—this is a matter for my right hon. Friend—the construction of any power station is agreed under a separate and later procedure. Therefore, even the clearance of the site does not by itself settle the construction of power stations of any particular type and at any particular point in time. As I said that is a separate procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the board sees the need for a new station, at that point it considers the type of fuel it would want to use and the particular location which will meet its requirements. The Secretary of State then considers the timing. He will also consider the question of fuel and the other implications for the environment and the rest. The environment question will have been cleared basically at the planning stage, but the other considerations will come into operation at that later time. In particular, it is at that time that the overall question of energy policy and the relationship of any particular application to overall energy requirements becomes one of the most acute considerations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is obvious that this kind of procedure presents considerable advantages from the boards' point of view, importing an element of flexibility into the situation, and it presents considerable advantages from the point of view of the Government, too. But I appreciate that it imposes certain disadvantages, or what will seem to be considerable disadvantages, for the people living near the projected sites, for which planning applications are submitted long before
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0443">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
the actual requirement. This is an almost unavoidable problem at the present time. If one leaves the application until too late, one then has the position which arose a number of years ago at Inverkip when the board said that, unless it obtained that particular site, there would quickly be a shortfall of electricity generating capacity which would be extremely serious from the Scottish point of view. A stringent timetable presents the worst kind of situation in which to make a planning decision. If we pay certain penalties, as I fear we do, from the point of view of the local population for planning in advance in the way I have described, these are more than outweighed by the penalties that could be imposed not only on the boards and the Government but on the people of Scotland, especially those in a critical location, if matters have to be decided with a stringent time element which would not permit the best decision from everybody's point of view. I hope I have explained the balance of advantage on one side or the other in proceeding as the boards are at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have talked basically about electricity generation because it is the capital expenditure which is involved in that which makes up the bulk of the electricity boards' borrowing requirements. I should be happy to try to answer questions on any other aspects of the boards' affairs which are relevant to this order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. J. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise that I did not hear the Minister's opening remarks. Can he shed any light on the extent to which, in the Government's estimation, the electricity boards' requirements for future generation capacity have been artificially inflated by demand artificially stimulated by price subsidisation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I mentioned a little earlier, perhaps before the hon. Gentleman came in, that the actual demand in Scotland in the last two years has been less than was estimated in 1972. That was a period when there has been price subsidisation. It could be argued that, if there had not been price subsidisation, the demand would have gone down even further, but that is a calculation which I am not at present in a position to make. Other things being equal, if there is price
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
subsidisation one increases the demand, and If there is an economic pricing system one moderates the demand. There are, however, so many factors to be taken into consideration—the price increases that are now taking place and subsequent price increases which are bound to take place at some time; the competitive situation in relation to oil, and, for that matter, in relation to coal also, and the whole world energy situation—that this is a uniquely difficult time at which to forecast demand. On the narrow point which the hon. Gentleman has raised, I have given the only answer possible. I dealt principally with electricity generation because that is the basic component of the demand by the electricity boards for increased borrowing powers, but, of course, there are other demands as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there are other points, naturally I shall be glad to try to answer them, but I hope that there is a general feeling in Scotland—this came out in last Thursday's debate, despite the high feeling generated by the recent large price increases—that the Scottish electricity boards perform a very useful service in a highly efficient way. They need the money to continue to do that, and I therefore have pleasure in commending the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.47 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Teddy Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You will be relieved to hear, Mrs. Butler, that I do not regard this as a very controversial order because most of us in the Opposition regard the electricity boards in Scotland as among the more efficient of our State industries. On the other hand, it will have been pleasant for you as Chairman of the Committee to have learned a great deal about Scottish electricity this morning, which, perhaps, you and others did not know before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I have a few questions for the Minister because these borrowing powers orders are among the few occasions on which we may ask detailed questions about the operation of the boards. This order suggests that we should increase the borrowing limits of the electricity boards in Scotland by about £250 million. Will the Minister indicate, first, how the borrowing is conducted? The annual reports of the boards give an indication of the advances from the Secretary of State who seems to act as a kind of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0444">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
secondary bank in this matter. At the end of the financial year the Secretary of State had advanced the South Board about £4 million at the rate of interest of about 15⅝ per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister say whether money is borrowed, as I believe it is, by the boards themselves apart from this secondary banking operation by the Secretary of State? If that is the case, will he say how much is borrowed by the North Board and how much by the South Board? Would it not be more appropriate to have orders, which I appreciate would involve an amendment to the Electricity Act, related to the individual boards, dealing with the separate borrowing powers of the North and the South Boards?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I turn to the actual borrowing. Some of the financial experts in our party, including my hon. Friend the Member for South Angus (Mr. J. BruceGardyne) understand these things better than I. Recently, however, I have been reading about very substantial borrowing by the nationalised boards in Europe. Some of it is on the Eurodollar market, the rest is straight borrowing in European currencies. Will the Minister say how much of the borrowing so far by the Scottish electricity boards has been in Britain and how much has been abroad?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other factor which interests me is whether the money which is borrowed abroad is borrowed on the basis of the value of these currencies at the time of repayment. In other words, if we borrow Swiss francs for the South of Scotland Electricity Board and the value of the Swiss franc rises substantially, do the nationalised industries have to pay back more to take account of the rise in the value of the currency?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a matter of interest to the general public, and I hope that the Minister will explain whether the money is borrowed at a straight rate of interest in sterling terms or whether, if there is an adjustment in the exchange rate, the boards will actually find themselves paying out more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These European loans appear to be very good bargains because money is loaned at 9 per cent. and 10 per cent. when the commercial rate in Britain is about 13 per cent. or 14 per cent. But is it a real bargain, or does an adjustment
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
in the currencies result in our paying more?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My third question is about the rather strange wording of the explanatory note. This refers to monies being borrowed
	<br><blockquote><p>"from the Commission of the European Communities and from the European Investment Bank …".</p></blockquote>
I knew that there were various financial institutions in the Common Market, but I did not know that the Commission itself had set itself up as a borrowing or lending agency. Will the Minister say what the Commission is doing in this connection? Does it lend money to the electricity boards, and on what basis does it lend?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My fourth question is about the use being made of the money. In the debate in the Scottish Grand Committee the other day, when the Minister was answering my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Fairgrieve), he indicated that the basis of our present policy was 65 per cent. dependence on coal for production of our electricity. I think that was the figure given, and my hon. Friend will correct me if I am wrong. On the other hand, the South Board, which covers the south of Scotland, is 80 per cent. dependent on coal. The actual wording in the annual report was:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Four-fifths of total electricity production is based upon coal."</p></blockquote>
Looking to the future, I wonder whether we are right to be so heavily dependent on one fuel. I appreciate that those who were shouting for coal when others were shouting for oil have been proved right to some degree because of the dramatic escalation in oil prices. On the other hand, it seems unfortunate, particularly when there are problems of industrial disruption in industry, that we should have such substantial dependence on one particular fuel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this connection, will the Minister say what the money will be used for in relation to the introduction of gas as a fuel. On the basis of the very good, happy, long-term commitments we have from the various companies producing gas from the North Sea, it would seem that for a considerable time to come gas will be, in bulk supply, about the cheapest form of fuel available. I can well remember in 1973 that there was a specific proposal about Kincardine power station, which I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0445">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
see from the board's report received the splendid award for the third time in four years of being the best power station in Scotland; an award is given every year, and for some reason this was the best power station—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not so much the best power station as the cleanest. The competition is run to ensure good housekeeping. The award is not so much for the thermal efficiency of output and so forth, but for the cleanest and brightest station.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the hon. Gentleman, but whatever is said, those who work in Kincardine have gained an award and people have said they have done extremely well. But, as the hon. Gentleman said, it is more for cleanliness than for thermal efficiency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My understanding is that there was a proposal in 1973 that the station should be converted from coal to coal and gas firing, which would clearly have had an implication for the cost of electricity in Scotland. I understand—though I am subject to correction—that the British Gas Corporation stopped this happening because it apparently has the right of veto on the use of gas by electricity stations. As these matters are under Government control directly or indirectly, and since general directions can be issued, will the Minister say what on earth the British Gas Corporation was doing in preventing gas from being supplied to the South of Scotland Electricity Board for the Kincardine power station? Can something be done about it and will he assure us that gas will be made available for our power stations if it appears to be the most competitive way of fuelling the stations? It is probably a complex story but I should like to know the reasoning behind that action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My next question looks to the future. The reports of the boards used to contain a splendid table, which always interested me enormously, of the average comparative costs of atomic, coal, oil and hydro production. It was interesting because, while the experts were telling us that atomic power would provide the cheapest electricity in the world, it always seemed to be at the top of the table. May we have up-to-date information on the costs
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
of different forms of fuelling the power stations? We miss these tables.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My fifth question is one which I raised during our debate last week on the forms of payment. We are giving the board a great deal more money and it is clear that, as the Minister said, the price of electricity will rise substantially, come what may. My hon. Friend the Member for South Angus raised the question of how demand had risen because of artificially low prices, but most people feel that electricity is rather expensive and try to reduce their demand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What worries me is that, with electricity bills at their present level, there could be a substantial problem of people being unable to pay their bills. I understand that bad debts last year for the South of Scotland Board were running at about £500,000. That is less than in the previous year, but it is still a substantial sum and those of us who represent Glasgow seats, including the hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. White), know of many disconnections because families just cannot afford to pay their electricity bills, or, more important, cannot manage their finances in such a way as to pay these quarterly bills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the board is starting two-monthly billing, but I still feel that, with the gradual removal of pre-payment meters, there is a desperate need for the board to undertake a full-scale inquiry within its own operations into finding easier methods of payment for the average consumer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My last point is the old one of fuel differentials. The Minister may rightly say that the previous Government were in power for a number of years and did nothing about it, despite my strenuous efforts from the back benches to persuade them so to do. On the other hand, it is ludicrous that there should be such wide price differentials in nationalised industries. For example, the South Board is complaining bitterly:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Coal in Scotland has long been expensive and will continue to rise in price."</p></blockquote>
Scottish electricity boards have to pay a lot more for their coal than do the boards in England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Previously the Minister advised us that domestic electricity in Scotland was marginally cheaper than in England, but that industrial electricity was marginally more
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0446">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
expensive. There is an important principle here and a strong case for looking at the possibility of uniform fuel costs throughout the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will reply to some of these questions, but I assure him that the Opposition regard our electricity boards as among the most efficient of our nationalised industries. We understand the need for an extension of their borrowing limits and we hope that they will continue to provide a good service to the public.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.59 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Lawson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is interesting and significant that so little criticism can be levelled at either the South of Scotland Electricity Board or the Hydro Board. Even those who are passionately—I might almost say dogmatically—opposed to nationalisation in any form have been able to find little to say adverse to those institutions. The hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Bruce-Gardyne) has a quite different type of complaint: his complaint is about intervention within nationalised industry and the prevention of nationalised industry from operating according to strict commercial criteria. But that is hardly a criticism to be levelled at the industry. It is a criticism to be levelled at Governments, perhaps.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has fairly summarised my criticisms, but I put it to him that this is one of the reasons for objecting to the whole principle of nationalisation. It is the existence of a nationalised industry which enables Ministers and civil servants to intervene in the way they do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lawson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the only consideration were profitability, the strict commercial criterion, as the means whereby one measured costs and efficiency, that might be so. But society, including all sorts of people of the hon. Member's own political persuasion, is increasingly coming to recognise that costs take a variety of forms. We talk of social costs, for example, of costs that cannot be properly measured in the normal commercial way. If one drives an additional underground line through London, it will cost an enormous amount of money. But it would be difficult to measure the advantages that accrue. If one were to measure the worth-whileness of doing it in terms of what it
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
would cost in money, and what it would bring back financially, one would never do it. There are many other factors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was on that point that I wanted to ask my hon. Friend a question or two. The Hydro Board, for example, cannot be judged in terms of its worthwhileness in a commercial sense. It cannot be measured from the point of view of the money that comes in. The strict criterion of commercial profitability cannot be applied. If it had been applied to the Hydro Board, one would in the first place have had a different set-up. One would not have had the developments that have taken place in the Highlands due to the Hydro Board. One would not have had the possibility of what the Hydro Board is doing now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend may be able to tell us to what extent the Hydro Board—I spoke a little about the South of Scotland Electricity Board only the other day, and I do not want to repeat myself—has achieved coverage of all the potential consumers of electricity within its area. We know of the remoteness of many of those potential consumers, in the Islands, for example. We know of the remote homesteads, and the exceeding difficulty and cost of taking electricity to those people. There is a demand for virtually a 100 per cent. coverage. I should be surprised if the Hydro Board had, under such circumstances as exist in the Highlands and Islands, achieved 100 per cent. coverage, though I am sure that the coverage has been extensive. I put it to the hon. Member for South Angus that it would never have been done, one would never have approached this stage, if the Hydro Board had been compelled to operate according to a strict commercial criterion. It would never have happened. The hon. Gentleman must consider the value of the measures that the Hydro Board has been able to take from that standpoint, not on the strict commercial criteria. Are there not other interests to be served, and other goods—, if I may use the word "good" in that all-embracing sense, not meaning just something one picks up in one's hands but something that is seen to be desirable in society?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another related matter of great importance. When the Hydro Board set about its business of utilising the waters of the Highlands, those responsible did
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0447">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
it with a wonderful sensitivity. They showed great sensitivity for the environment, for the appearance of the place. I do not know, Mrs. Butler, whether you have seen some of the power stations, or some of the dams. They are things of beauty, with the use of native stone and the way in which they have been built and fitted into their surroundings. In many cases, it is a pleasure to see them. There are people who come long distances merely to see these places. They must have cost a lot of money. Perhaps my hon. Friend could give me some information on this point. Perhaps it is still costing a lot of money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we set about the business of utilising the waters of the Highlands foe these purposes, a lot of compensation had to be paid to rich landowners in respect of fishing rights, especially in salmon fisheries. I do not at the moment have the figure, but there has been an accumulation over the years. Not only was there a heavy payment of compensation in respect of the fishing rights which were in danger, but there was the taking on of the job of maintaining and improving those fishing facilities. We know of the fish dams and the various means adopted to keep the salmon from destroying themselves on the turbine blades. We should know more about the cost of these things.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What has happened to the other demand which was widely voiced until only fairly recently? I have rather lost sight of it. One of the large county councils in the area, for example, and many trade unionists and members of the Labour Party were demanding virtually the confiscation of those fishing rights and the handing of them over to the public, with no sum to be paid whatsoever. My understanding was that the Hydro Board, when our ex-colleague in the House, Tom Fraser, was chairman, was fighting an action saying that, if what the board had paid so much for and had spent so much money on improving was to be passed over to the public, at least some compensation should be paid to the Hydro Board in respect of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people in the Labour Party were outraged at the suggestion that the Hydro Board should want payment for these fishing rights. The argument was that the fishing rights should be simply passed over to the public. I am as
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
interested as most people in curious rights and facilities and the fisher's rights to cast his fly, but I recognise that the Hydro Board had a good case. I hope that my hon. Friend can tell us what happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are one or two points on which I should like a little further information. I am sure the hon. Member for South Angus will agree that they do not fit into his profitability criterion. I am not against profitability, but that criterion breaks down when one thinks in terms of large social interests. The hon. Gentleman, who is a very intelligent person occasionally, will recognise that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the point raised by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor), I noticed the reference in the explanatory note to the borrowing of sterling from the Commission of European Communities and from the European Investment Bank. I, too, should like to know how much it is. May I say that I am very happy about this, having supported our entry into Europe over a long period of time and in no way having budged from what I said was the correct line for this country. I shall be very happy if my hon. Friend can tell me that the borrowing has been very extensive and that the terms are good.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I noticed, for example, extensive borrowing at 1 per cent. from Europe the other day. I have racked my brain as to who it was who received it, but I cannot remember. With inflation at nearly 20 per cent., 1 per cent. is nearly giving it away. I do not know what the people who are lending the money are thinking about. It is virtually sacrificing the money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows so much about this and I know so little. Will he please tell me where these banks that give out these splendid 1 per cent. loans obtain their money?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lawson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is in touch with his hon. Friend who is a great financial expert. In many cases, one can create money. One can go on creating money without creating inflation up to the point where production is being driven beyond capacity to meet the demand. If one has loose productive capacity, one can go on creating consumer power to take up that loose productive capacity. For example, if one has large-scale unemployment, one can go on pumping additional
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0448">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
money into circulation and generating real production without causing inflation. When one pushes it beyond that stage, one has inflation. Money can be printed. It is a question of what the money covers, how it is put into circulation. I am sure that the hon. Member for South Angus and I might get together some time to discuss it. This is not the occasion to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can my hon. Friend tell we whether we are borrowing on excellent terms from the European Community, how much the rate of interest is, and how generous they are in the length of time we are given to repay. If he can tell us that and show that we are benefitting, as I expect we are, very greatly from our connection with the European Community, I, for one, shall have no cause to object to this order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.12 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Russell Fairgrieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I make one brief point in support of my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor)? I am worried about gas-firing. We know that, when a Government make a mistake, it is usually a big mistake, and then it becomes a bureaucratic vested interest to keep the mistake going. There is no question but that there has been trouble between these two boards on the question of gas-firing at stations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that the North Sea will yield oil and gas, with different proportions of gas to oil, depending upon the field. There is a serious danger that some of this gas will be flared off uselessly at sea unless we put our heads together and bring some sense into this business. Can the Minister give some assurance that he will see the gas and electricity authorities and do some head-knocking before that gas is flared away, when it could be powering our power stations? This is very important, particularly in Scotland where there is a higher than national average of uneconomic pits, and where many of the pits should probably not be producing coal now for power stations which ought to be turned over to gas instead.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.13 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The order covers both the Scottish boards. I, for one, would like to see the two boards in Scotland combined to form one electricity board, because in some ways there is
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
quite an overlap in admiinstration, in the interchange of energy, the control of power station loads and so on, which could very well be done from a single source rather than the two sources we have at present, one in Glasgow and one in Pitlochry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It could be argued that the Hydro Board has a different function to perform in Scotland because certain social conditions were laid down in the Act which created it. But in many ways this has already been overtaken by time because there are few sources now available in the north of Scotland to be taken over and used for the production of hydro-energy itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was a power station engineer, and I am concerned about the use of gas for producing electricity. Coal is by far the major source of fuel producing electricity, but it creates other problems. There are dust handling problems with the final product, but, more important, there are air pollution problems. Pollution from our coal-fired stations is quite high and usually exceeds in some ways the limits laid down by the Alkali Inspectorate which supervises this aspect of pollution. There is also pollution from the use of oil, and I am quite sure that if we were able to use gas this would also help to cut down this source of pollution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor) said that he did not see in the board's reports any figures for the costs of producing electricity from different sources of energy. But on page 14 of the little booklet that was issued with the report and is a sort of potted version of it, it is stated that this year the cost of producing electricity from coal, oil and gas turbine was 0·563p per unit, the cost of producing it from nuclear fuel was 0·626p per unit, and from hydroelectric was 0·160p. Clearly, if we could harness more water power it would be to our advantage. But, as I have said already, we shall probably run out of all those sources which would be an economic proposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Comparing the costs for this year with those for last year, we shall see that nuclear fuel is becoming more competitive. It may continue to do so, because the board has long-term agreements on the price for nuclear fuel, whereas the cost of oil and coal will continue to rise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0449">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
One of the problems in pricing the different ways of producing electricity is that probably our oil-fired stations are in some instances more efficient than in others. One of the true ways of looking at the cost of energy is to do so on the basis of cost per therm. In 1972 the cost of coal per therm was 3·227p and of oil 2·715p, whereas last year it was 3·004p for coal and 3·678p for oil. The position is being dramatically reversed, and as the cost of oil works its way through the system this year that will be increasingly emphasised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some ways, as the hon. Member for Cathcart pointed out, we had all our eggs in one basket, the coal basket. We certainly were the biggest customer of the coal industry in Scotland. We have been penalised over the years with a surcharge of about 50p per ton because of the extra cost of producing coal in Scotland. But, because of our excellent power stations and the way that they burn so excellently, the cost of producing electricity was no greater than in the south.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to have the Minister' comments on two matters. One which has already been emphasised, is the use of gas. It is much easier to transmit energy of gas by wire, if we have a power station at a gas receiving point on the coast, and push the electricity out through the grid system. That is far better than laying a large gas pipeline and distributing it in that way throughout the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Second, have the Government thought of looking again at the Mackenzie Report, which went into the business of combining the two Scottish electricity boards? That would increase efficiency and still maintain in many ways the social aspects of electricity in the Highlands. We have some remote areas in the south of Scotland as well—the uplands, Galloway and so on. The cost of taking electricity to such outlying areas is high. Can the Minister say whether the Government will consider taking the Mackenzie Report out again, dusting it and seeing whether the two Scottish boards can be combined?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.20 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. J. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We seem to have ranged quite widely in the debate on this order. We need to be clear about what we are being invited to sanction.
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
The hon. Member for Motherwell and Wishaw (Mr. Lawson) advanced some interesting arguments about the relevance or non-relevance of commercial considerations and profit motive in the operations of the electricity boards. The proposition he advanced in the concluding stages of his remarks, that provided there was a degree of spare capacity in the economy the priniting of additional money was not inflationary, would not necessarily command universal acceptance. It carries us very wide of the order, and I will not pursue it further now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems that the relevance or non-relevance of commercial criteria to the activities of the electricity boards is an important part of the background against which the order should be considered. I accept with the hon. Member for Motherwell and Wishaw (Mr. Lawson) that the Hydro Board in particular is engaged in many activities—not all of which I should necessarily regard as being indisputably of value to the extent that he would—which could not possibly offer an adequate commercial return on the investment involved. Nevertheless, from the time of the 1961 White Paper until 1971 the Hydro Board and the South of Scotland Electricity Board, with the other nationalised industries, had commercial targets, financial targets, which they were expected to achieve. On the whole those targets were honoured a great deal more in the breach than in the observance, but they remained as an idea which was not frequently attained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since 1971 those targets have been tacitly abandoned. The point I sought to make in my intervention during the hon. Gentleman's speech was that they were abandoned not at the request of the nationalised industries themselves, but at the insistence of central Government. I thought at the time and since that the insistence was mistaken. I am strongly reinforced in my conviction that the sooner we can eventually push back the frontiers of the public sector, diminish the range of nationalisation and diminish the ability of Ministers to intervene in matters such as this which are liable to have very undesirable long-term economic consequences, the better it will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the background to double-banked controls over the pricing of the electricity boards, first by the Price Commission and secondly by Ministers. It is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0450">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
a double-banked control calculated to ensure that the Hydro Board and the South of Scotland Electricity Board are not allowed to earn a return which enables them to service their fixed capital. Against that background we are invited this morning to approve an enlargement. as my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor) pointed out, of the boards' borrowing powers by something like £250 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State told us that this sum was expected to last until 1977-78. All I can say is that he is a cock-eyed optimist. I should imagine that whatever Government is in power will be back next year asking for more. At the present rate of accelerating inflation, these additional powers will not last any time at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should understand what we mean when we talk about an increase in the borrowing powers of £250 million. In normal English language, that means that the Hydro Board and the SSEB will be empowered to increase their borrowings by £250 million and to incur the obligations of service charges which they will have to finance from their resources accordingly. But normal English language is suspended at the present time. That will not happen. What will happen is that the additional £250 million—which I venture to hazard a guess will be swallowed up in a year, perhaps less—will be financed essentially in one of three ways: from taxation, from printing presses—and I must tell the hon. Member for Motherwell and Wishaw that in my opinion at the present time that would be a highly inflationary proceeding—or,thirdly, in the Eurodollar market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Cathcart and with the hon. Member for Motherwell and Wishaw that it would be interesting for the Minister of State to shed further light on the Government's intentions on overseas borrowing by the boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again we should understand the implications of borrowing by the boards and the other statutory corporations. It means that we are financing the balance of payments deficit—that is what it is all about—by hypothecating our future invisible earnings and by accumulating at a very rapid rate an additional burden of interest charges which will have to be met and which are a direct burden on
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
the balance of payments. In other words, we are digging a deeper and deeper pit for ourselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that the Committee should remind itself that only yesterday what I believe are the largest summer Supplementary Estimates ever were presented to Parliament. They amount to some £1,400 million. That is one reasonable measure of the manner in which the public expenditure is fuelling the fires of inflation week by week and day by day. The largest single item in these summer Supplementary Estimates is the subsidisation of the prices of the nationalised industries because of the so-called counter-inflation policy. Is it this technique of financing the activities of the electricity boards, among others, which ensures that the additonal borrowing that the order seeks to provide will be financed by hypothecating future revenues abroad, by higher taxation, or by the simple expedient of recourse to the printing press.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So we should be under no illusions about the inflationary implications of what we are about this morning. That does not mean that one should oppose the passing of the order, because Parliament, having willed the means, must accept the consequences. It is important, however, before we pass the order, to recognise what those consequences are. This is not a simple matter, which comes and goes at frequent intervals through our parliamentary calendar, of extending the borrowing authority of one nationalised industry after another, because we have suspended, until we know not when, the obligation, or at any rate the objective, imposed on the nationalised industries to finance their prior charge capital on a proper commercial basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have therefore decided to commit ourselves to a continuing process of Government-stimulated inflation. Provided we understand that that is what this order is about I do not object to its passage, but I hope that before we conclude our discussions this morning the Minister of State will not only answer the numerous and important questions put to him by my hon. Friend the Member for Cathcart but in particular will try to shed some light on the extent to which the Government expect to persuade and encourage the electricity boards to use these borrowing powers for the purpose
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0451">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
of raising additional loans in the foreign currency market.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.32 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been asked a large number of questions. I shall try my best to answer a fair number of them. I must say that one argument for having a separate borrowing order for each of the boards would be that I should not have to thumb my way through two separate boards' accounts to provide the answers, because in fact most of the answers to the points raised this morning are, with respect, included in the latest accounts for the South of Scotland and the Hydro Boards, but it is difficult to put one's finger on them all very quickly, particularly when one has two documents to look through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope I shall give a fair amount of information in answer to the points which have been put to me. The accounts are available and have been sent to all hon. Members in the past week or fortnight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position on borrowing is laid out for each of the boards in great detail in the accounts themselves. In the case of the South Board, I refer hon. Members to page 41 of the accounts. It would be tedious if I were to attempt to read out everything on that page, but it is all there. In the case of the North Board. it is similarly all there on page 43 of the accounts. From these statements I can see that the amount of borrowing which is made up by foreign borrowing is so far comparatively small. It is perfectly true that in the past year there was considerable borrowing in the United States. Again, that is mentioned specifically in the board's accounts and, for that matter, the terms on which the money was borrowed and the reasons for it are also explained in the South Board's accounts on page 8. The board resorted to foreign borrowing because interest rates in this country were extremely high. In the case of the South Board, £42 million was borrowed in United States dollars in 1973–74. Similar reference to page 8 of the board's accounts will give an answer to another question—whether the boards were safeguarded against exchange rates. This was the point made by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor). He will see there that they are safeguarded by Government guarantees.
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
As I understand the position, virtually all the borrowing, whether in Europe or elsewhere, by either board is in fact subject to similar Treasury guarantees. I think that there is one exception—one particular loan which was taken without Treasury guarantee and on which there might be some exchange risk. But the basic situation is that these loans are taken with Treasury guarantees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has just made a very remarkable statement, which I am sure should not rest on the record without comment, and, dare say, he would not wish it to do so. He said that in one particular case he thought that an exchange rate guarantee had not applied because it was thought that there was an exchange rate risk. But there is an exchange rate risk in all these transactions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what I understood the hon. Gentleman to say. But it must not go on record that these transactions do not involve exchange rate risks, because every one of them does.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course it does. There would not need to be a Treasury guarantee against them if they did not involve a risk. But I did not say that there was a particular loan which did not involve a risk. T said the exact opposite. that one particular loan was taken by the South Board about two years ago. It was negotiated without a Treasury guarantee. Therefore, if there are exchange losses on that loan, they will be borne by the board and not by the Government. That is what I think I said, and certainly if I did not do so. I now make that absolutely clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Question of Government policy on foreign borrowing is a matter which goes well beyond the question of borrowing requirements by the electricity boards in Scotland and raises matters of economic policy for which clearly I am not the Minister responsible and on which I do not want to make any pronouncements this morning. Obviously, if one borrows abroad there is an interest liability in future which means that one has an advantage in the short term from the balance-of-payments point of view and a longer-term disadvantage, in the same way as the reverse happens when one lends
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0452">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
or invests abroad. But these are matters strictly for the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and not for me. It is well known that in the last years of the previous administration there was very substantial borrowing abroad, and there is substantial borrowing abroad, as far as I am aware, continuing up to the present time to finance balance-of-payments deficits, specifically those arising from the very substantial increase in oil prices over the past few months. These are matters of well-defined and well-argued Government policy and not specifically matters for me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, in so far as the electricity boards of Scotland are borrowing abroad with Treasury guarantee, there must be at least an implication—and I would say rather more than that—that that happens only with what is in effect Government approval.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister mean by "Treasury guarantee" that the boards are then inured against a currency change but that the Treasury has to fork it out? In other words, as a country we still have to fork it out if there is a change in currencies, and for the boards it is an accounting method of getting out of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: From the boards' point of view it is rather more than an accounting method. It is very important from their point of view that they should be guaranteed in this way. The hon. Gentleman is stating it as I have already explained it and, as I have said, it is already stated in the boards' accounts. There is no secret about this. It was all done under the previous Government, not under the present Government. But the fact is that it is already stated in the boards' accounts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I pass from the question of borrowing to a number of other matters which were raised. First, there was the question of the cost of the different methods of fuelling power stations in Scotland. These are set out in the boards' accounts. In the case of the Hydro Board, the figures appear on page 9; in the case of the South of Scotland Board the figures appear on page 44. They are actually there; they are published as they have always been. I do not wish to comment on them now, because they are historic costs and we are more concerned
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
with what the different costs of electricity generation are likely to be in the future— specifically in relation to new power stations in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said earlier, the boards' and the Government's planning is directed to giving the maximum flexibility in determining the kind of fuelling to be used for subsequent power stations. This is the only way in which we can proceed. For example, the question of gas firing in the case of the Carriden site near Bo'ness is taken care of by the fact that there is an application for an oil-fired or gas-fired station. The reason that coal is not included there is that the electricity industry in Scotland is already burning, and is likely to continue to burn, the maximum amount of coal that will be available and suitable for electricity generation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My point was that we are interested in the difference between coal, oil, gas turbine and nuclear fuel. As far as I can recall from page 44, I do not think that separate figures were given for coal, oil and gas turbine. They were lumped together.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Milan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is perfectly true. I do not think that it is true in the case of the North of Scotland Board, but it is true that they have put the figures together. I do not know whether separate figures are given elsewhere in the accounts, but the question of generation costs, comparing coal with oil, is dealt with quite extensively in the first section of the South Board's report. It is pointed out that the South of Scotland Electricity Board was burning coal in Scotland at the specific request of the National Coal Board and the Government, for reasons of national energy policy, and was being compensated by the Government for the additional cost of generation involved because it was doing it despite the fact that, from the strictly economic point of view, oil was the cheaper source of fuel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The relative situation has changed now because oil has risen by three or tour times in price and the price of coal has gone up by a substantial amount—though not nearly as much as that. That is why I was making the general point that it is extremely difficult to say what the situation is, at any point in time, with any kind of assurance that that situation will continue for long. One can

	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
say only that in planning future power stations and in operating the power stations now being built—which I outlined in my opening remarks and to which we are committed; they are being built and are well on the way to being commisisoned—taking Scotland as a whole, the boards would clearly want to use their whole generating system in a way which minimises their overall costs. One cannot say anything more meaningful than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The more important question, when we come to decide on subsequent power stations, is what is likely to provide the most flexible and economic mix of fuelling for the system as a whole. It is well known that the South Board particularly has over many years been very concerned with its over-reliance, as it sees it, on coal. It is one of the reasons why it has been so anxious to increase its nuclear capacity. Its nuclear capacity will be increased when Hunterston comes into operation and is likely to increase further is either of the proposed sites is cleared and eventually power stations are built. The Board would take the view, which I think has much substance in it, that the more flexibility in the system the easier it will be to respond in an economic way to future price changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for gas, I have already said that the board has applied for permission to have either oil or gas generation at the Carriden Site.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to deal with the question, which is dealt with explicitly in the SSEB's accounts, about converting Kincardine to burn gas, and why that has not acutally happened. Under the Continental Shelf Act the British Gas Corporation has the first option on North Sea gas intended for fuel purposes. The proposal of the SSEB on the other hand was to convert Kincardine power station on the basis of direct sale of the gas to the board by British Petroleum. That was contrary to the statutory position. All this happened under the previous Government and not under the present one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the previous Secretary of State for Energy had been satisfied that the British Gas Corporation had rejected the opportunity to purchase the gas at a reasonable price, he could have consented to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
direct sale of the gas by British Petroleum to the SSEB. The right hon. Gentleman was not so satisfied. Therefore the statutory right of the BGC to the first option of the gas was fully maintained. The South Board then found itself in the position, if it wanted the gas, of having to purchase it through the BGC. Later British Petroleum—I think it is specifically mentioned in the report—having reassessed the position withdrew from the provisional agreement into which it had entered wth the SSEB.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a market available to BP for the propane, which is one of the components of the gas, and is clearly something which has influenced BP's outlook. There may not be a complete cessation of negotiations. Certain possibilities may still exist, but it is a highly complex situation. For example, the question of the British Steel Corporation buying the gas has also come into the reckoning. I do not want to say any more about it at the moment. There is a statutory background. The previous Secretary of State for Energy did not intervene. I can confirm that there is no question of the gas being used for some unecomonic purpose. The Government and the nation have a strong interest in seeing that the gas is used in an economic and Sensible way. It is a high-grade fuel; therefore the fact that it may not;,),e used to convert Kincardine from coal to gas does not mean that the gas in some way or other will either be wasted or used for an uneconomic purpose. It is a very complex situation and clearly the Government are retaining an interest in what is happening.

My hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, West (Mr. Campbell) would like to see the boards merged. For reasons other than questions of planning generating capacity, I should be sorry to see that happen. I took a very strong view against the Mackenzie Committee when it reported in 1962, and I have not basically changed my view since then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is already quite a lot of cooperation between the two boards, and not only on the planning of generating capacity which I have already mentioned. Each of the boards' chairmen sits on the other board, and there is, therefore, close liaison. I should not be happy to see the Hydro Board swallowed up by the South
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0454">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
Board, which is certainly how people in the north of Scotland would interpret any merging of the boards, because the Hydro Board has its specific social obligations which it has discharged with considerable satisfaction since its inception.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is now coverage—this answers a point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Motherwell and Wishaw (Mr. Lawson)—to the extent of about 98 per cent. of the consumers in the area. This is referred to on page 7 of the last Annual report of the board. The board has been able to use the economic advantages of cheap hydro-power to extend the supply to consumers who are grossly uneconomic. In a sense, the consumers in the Hydro Board area not only obtain cheap power from hydro-electricity but they also help to extend to their fellow countrymen in remote areas the benefits of electricity which would not otherwise be available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I pointed out in our debate last Thursday, one of the incidental effects of that is that even where the electricity is not supplied by hydro means, for example on the islands, being supplied instead by extremely expensive diesel generation, the consumers there receive the benefit of electricity at the standard Hydro Board prices because they are being subsidised in a sense by the board's consumers on the mainland. I believe, as my hon. Friend also clearly believes, that this is an important social obligation on the Hydro Board. It is, perhaps, not always looked upon specifically as a social obligation, but it is an example of the way in which the benefits of hydro-power have been spread throughout the Highlands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The board itself, of course, has taken considerable interest in amenity and other matters. It has taken considerable interest in conjunction with Highlands and Islands Development Board in the expansion of industry in the Highlands area. This is all done as part of a day-to-day remit; it does not separate these things out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend asked whether I could give some figures of cost, but the board does not separate these figures out. It regards itself as having an obligation to do these things not as a separate part of its activities but as an integral part of the kind of remit it has for the Highlands as a whole. I entirely agree that it has done a very good job in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
On the particular question of fishing rights, there are not, in fact, many left in the possession of the Hydro Board at the present time, but I shall write to my hon. Friend about those which are left.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are one or two other points which I shall deal with briefly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regarding electricity bills, for example, and the point raised by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor), some of the things that have been done by the South Board in the way of two-monthly billing and so on will certainly help to cut out bad debts. But one is faced with the situation here, as in other electricity board areas, that the system which prevents bad debts arising for the domestic consumer—namely, the use of pre-payment meters—has considerable disadvantages in the case of burglaries, breaking into meters, and a number of other disadvantages, and one must look to other systems, for example, monthly payments, buying stamps, more frequent billing and so on, to deal with this particular problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In dealing with people on supplementary benefit, there may be opportunities for looking at the functions of the Supplementary Benefits Commission. I am glad to tell the hon. Member for Cathcart, who has taken an interest in this matter, that a circular has been sent out—not about electricity but on rent and rates—to social security offices in Scotland asking them to adopt a more liberal policy in making direct payments than they have so far. That was done at my own instigation, as a Glasgow Member of Parliament, especially in relation to this problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Concerning standard electricity prices, even throughout Scotland, again this would very largely be to the detriment of the commercial flexibility and commercial judgment of the individual boards. One would be very reluctant to see that happening unless one was actually integrating the two boards completely. As I have said, there are very strong reasons why we should not do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I have covered the majority of the points that have been raised during the debate this morning. In conclusion, I should like to say that I am glad that despite having all these particular points to raise, hon. Gentlemen on both sides of
