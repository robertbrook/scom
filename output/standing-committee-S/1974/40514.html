SCOTTISH GRAND COMMITTEE</div> <!-- title -->
<time>Tuesday, 14th May 1974</time>
<p>[SIR MYER GALPERN <i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
<div class='debates'><span class='label label-warning'>debates</span>

<section>
<div class='page-header'><h1>HOUSING (SCOTLAND) BILL</h1></div>
<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
<p><i>Resolved</i>:
<br><blockquote><p>That if the proceedings on the Housing (Scotland) Bill are not completed at this day's sitting the Committee do meet on Tuesday next at half-past Ten o'clock.—[<i>Mr. William Ross</i>.]</p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Myer. I wish to raise with you a matter which was raised on the Floor of the House last Thursday. This is the adhesion to this Committee of Members who do not represent Scottish constituencies. For some reason, additional Members have been appointed, yet the balance of Members of Parliament within Scotland has been fixed by the Scottish electorate. It is a great pity—and I doubt the competency of the appointments—that there should be present in this Committee dealing with Scottish business, hon. Members from non-Scottish constituencies.<br><br>
I therefore ask you to rule that the English Members present should withdraw from the proceedings. This would be in their best interests, as I know because I should not like to be exiled to an English Committee discussing English business.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Teddy Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir Myer. I hope that you will bear in mind that many of us as Scottish Members want to play an effective part in Committees on English Bills affecting England, because what happens in English legislation can have an effect on Scottish legislation. If we as Scots are to be restricted to matters affecting Scotland and are not allowed to take part in proceedings affecting the United Kingdom or England we might as well go back to the parish pump and not take a genuine interest in the affairs of Great Britain as a whole.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Several Members</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. First I ask hon. Members to put one point of order at a time. It is unfair to ask the Chair to rule upon a collection of points of order. We can take one only at a time.<br><br>
I think that the hon. Member for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson) knows by now that the conduct of the proceedings of the House of Commons and of its Committee is governed by Standing Orders. Standing Order No. 68(2) governs the composition of the Committee, and it is not open to me, as Chairman of this Committee, to interfere with the decisions of the Committee of Selection or of any other Committee. The hon. Member's point is entirely out of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Myer. Could you at least make sure that all Scottish Members attend this Committee? I notice that about half of the SNP Members are not here at all. It ill becomes them to protest about exclusiveness of Scottish business when half of them are not here.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not aware of any Standing Order which gives power to the Chairman of the Committee to compel the attendance of any hon. Member. All the Chair is concerned with is to ensure that there is a quorum throughout the proceedings, and I hope that one will be maintained this morning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a further point of order, Sir Myer. This is a very serious point. Can I have your assurance that you will communicate to your colleagues on the Panel of Chairmen and to the Committee of Selection that we do not share the point of view expressed by the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson)? The logic of the hon. Gentleman's case seems to be that in debates in the House not on specifically Scottish matters—for example, today's debate on the state of the Press—Scottish Members would not wish to take part or would not be interested. I hope that you will communicate to the powers that be that this Committee does not share the point of view expressed by the hon. Member for Dundee, East.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Member that I have no intention of interfering with Standing Orders.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. William Ross)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do report to the House that the Committee have considered the Housing (Scotland) Bill in relation to the principle of the Bill.</p></blockquote>
The last time I presented a Bill on this
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0133">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
subject to this Committee was in March of 1969. On that occasion I stressed that the problem of older housing in Scotland was complex and that the solutions attempted by various Governments had produced imbalances between the private and public housing sectors; between the rate of new building and the rate of slum clearance in some local authority areas; and between the proportions of new and old houses in the country. I believe that the 1969 Act went some way to correcting these imbalances.<br><br>
The proposals included by my predecessor in the Housing and Planning Bill which was introduced in February of this year demonstrate that he and his hon. Friends recognised this. They were based on the foundations of the 1969 Act. The basic consensus between both sides of the Committee on this issue is demonstrated by the fact that I am now reintroducing most of these provisions although we have made important changes and additions.<br><br>
Our first priority, apart from new buildings, must be to improve the living conditions of those tens of thousands of families who are still forced to live in houses with no inside wc, no hot water and no bath. The effect on children and young parents of living in such conditions, often in houses too small for the size of family, and with too often a filthy and depressing environment, does incalulable damage to society as a whole. The Bill will, I believe, help local authorities to clear slums quickly and ensure an immediate improvement to unsatisfactory houses. If a house has got to remain in use, even for a few years, it may not be a waste of money to ensure that it has the basic amenities.<br><br>
I think it would be helpful for the Committee if I first identified the chances which we have made to the provisions included in the Housing and Planning Bill which was introduced by the previous administration and had a Second Reading. I will then go on to describe how the provisions of this Bill differ from the present legislation.<br><br>
The first change we have made is to have a separate Scottish Bill. The Scottish proposals in the Housing and Planning Bill were in 11 clauses in the middle of a Great Britain Bill, with other new clauses hidden in an amending schedule
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
and mass of further amendments in other schedules all very difficult to follow and inconvenient for those who have to administer legislation.<br><br>
Secondly, we have raised the tolerable standard—in Clause 14—so that a house which does not have exclusive use of a wc suitably located within the house itself will fail the standard and be subject to local authority action.<br><br>
Thirdly, to meet a request from Glasgow Corporation we have altered the criteria by which housing action areas for improvement can be declared—Clauses 16 and 17. Houses which lack standard amenities can come into the reckoning as well as those which fail the tolerable standard. This will bring some 45,000 additional houses into the field for area improvemnt.<br><br>
Fourthly, we are empowering—Clause 11(5)—local authorities to pay improvement grant in housing action areas at up to 90 per cent., instead of the normal 75 per cent., in cases of special financial hardship.<br><br>
Fifthly, conditions attached to improvement grants will apply for a period of five years instead of three, and authorities will be able to attach the occupancy condition to owner-occupiers as well as to landlords. They will have a discretion not to recover grant from owner-occupiers when the condition has been breached if they are persuaded that recovery would be unreasonable. For example, somebody may have to change his job and sell a house which has been improved.<br><br>
Sixthly, we are extending—Clause 44 —local authorities' power to lend money to enable people to buy, to construct or to improve houses. In using their present powers they are particularly encouraged to act as lenders of last resort: they lend for example to people who have attempted, but failed, to obtain a building society mortgage, or for conversion works to sub-standard houses which building societies are reluctant to support.<br><br>
Clause 44 extends their powers in three minor but important respects. First, they will be able to lend money to repay an existing mortgage: in the case, for example, where an owner-occupier wishes to borrow money to improve his house but is unable to persuade the original lender to make a further advance. Secondly, they will be able to lend money in relation to premises which are not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0134">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
entirely residential; for example, for a house which has a small shop attached, always provided that the primary aim is the provision of housing accommodation. Thirdly, they will be able to grant low start mortgages under which the borrower repays less in the early years of the mort- gage and more later, and maturity mortgages where the principal is paid in one lump sum on the expiry of the loan.<br><br>
The total amount of lending by Scottish local authorities for house purchase, some £7 million a year, may be small in relation to the sums lent by the building societies, but its real value is that in many cases a local authority loan provides the only means of meeting the aspirations of some intending house purchasers. I should like to see local authorities making as great a use as possible of their existing powers to lend money for this purpose and of the extended powers with which we are now seeking to provide them.<br><br>
Seventhly, we are providing—Clause 45 —for a new subsidy, the rent income subsidy. There can be no doubt that the large rent increases under the Conserva- tives—Just under £50 during their last two years in office—contributed to inflationary pressures. Rents were allowed to rise while wages were held in check. Within days of taking office the present Government took action to freeze rents for the rest of the year. while we make a fresh assessment of housing finance. Under the 1972 Act arrangements local ratepayers would have borne most of the cost of the rent freeze. We recognise the unfairness of this, and by the new rent income subsidy we shall meet the major part of the loss arising from the standstill on council house rents, thereby safeguarding the interests of ratepayers. Details of the subsidy will be a matter for regulations in due course, but, in general, local authorities may expect to receive subsidy amounting to at least 80 per cent. of the lost rent income which is attributable to the standstill.<br><br>
Part I, Clauses 1–12, contains revised provisions for a house improvement grant scheme. In recent years the improvement grant scheme has certainly been popular. In 1969 fewer than 4,000 grants were paid by local authorities to private owners. Last year the total was more than 22,000. Much of this increase was certainly due to the higher grants introduced for a limited period by the previous adminis-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
tration, and I pay tribute to the Conservative Party for that stimulus to improvement work.<br><br>
At the same time, I think it would admit that the handout has been indiscriminate. We know that a number of these grants have gone to houses which were already perfectly satisfactory—for example, to put in a second bathroom, or to holiday houses. We also know that some of the money has gone to property developers for conversion work which was profitable enough without the grant. We cannot allow this when there are still some 180,000 houses in the private sector below the present tolerable standard. The main purpose of the changes to the improvement grant scheme is, therefore, to make the scheme more selective and to ensure that assistance is concentrated on the houses most in need of improvement.<br><br>
We have also simplified the grant scheme considerably, by integrating the discretionary and standard grants while retaining owners' right to a grant for the installation of missing basic amenities and have made it more generous towards works of repair.<br><br>
10.45 a.m.<br><br>
Part II—Clause 13 to 35—contains the most important provisions in the Bill. They provide for the designation of areas as housing action areas, which are a logical evolution of the housing treatment areas established in our 1969 Act. I think I can best explain what we are trying to achieve by discussing four defects which experience has shown in the present procedure. I assume that hon. Members will be aware of the basic outlines of the housing treatment area procedure. If they are not I commend the 1969 Act to them.<br><br>
The first defect of the housing area for improvement procedure is that it offers no specific incentives to owners or local authorities to take action. There is nothing to induce local authorities to concentrate on the worst areas.<br><br>
In the housing action area for improvement there will be a number of incentives. Anyone who has to carry out works to bring his house up to the required standard will have a right to grant at 75 per cent. towards that work—the rate elsewhere will be 50 per cent.—and, as I have said, in cases of special hardship at up to 90 per cent. Local authorities will receive Exchequer contribution at 90 per cent. towards their expenditure on grants
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0135">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
to private owners in housing action areas, compared with 75 per cent. towards expenditure on grants outside them and they will get an Exchequer contribution of 75 per cent. for work on houses which they own in such areas compared with 37½ per cent. for work on houses elsewhere.<br><br>
There will be a special grant in housing action areas for repairs even where no other improvement work is needed. This will be available, at the discretion of the local authority, at 75 per cent. towards up to £800 worth of work. An owner of limited means whose house was otherwise up to standard could therefore receive up to £600 towards essential repairs.<br><br>
Finally, in an action area, if an owner cannot afford to meet that part of the cost of works of improvement or repair which is not covered by grant, the local authority will be obliged, under Clause 24, to offer him a loan of the balance.<br><br>
The second defect is that the present procedure takes no account of the view of the people in the area. They do not have to be consulted about whether an area should be improved or demolished, and in many cases the first they hear about the housing treatment area is when they receive notice of a compulsory purchase order for their house from the local authority. Naturally, people resent this and tend to object bitterly to compulsory purchase orders. This can lead to long delays which impede progress in this desirable work.<br><br>
Under the new procedure a local authority is obliged to publish its proposals; serve notice of them on all the people affected; and to have regard, before making a final decision, to any representations received from the people in the area. They will have two months from the date of notice being given within which to make these representations.<br><br>
This is a real attempt to improve people in planning of the area in which they live.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Lawson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When a local authority hears representations on a matter of this sort is it not the case that the very committee that makes a decision to do something is the committee which hears representations and that it is finally this committee which decides whether to accept or to throw out those representa-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
tions? Is it not worth while looking to see whether it is right that a local authority committee should be judge, jury, and virtually policeman on its own behalf?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We would want to try to instill a spirit of greater co-operation and appreciation of one another's difficulties among those authorities and individuals who are involved. I take my hon. Friend's point, but it must be remembered that proposals are submitted to the Department, and, therefore, we can see whether fairness and justice are being done. We should not start on the basis that there is obviously antagonism but rather that the local authority is striving to find a way to get over the difficulties so that desirable improvements can be made as quickly as possible. But what my hon. Friend has mentioned is a valuable point. I hope that the result will be fewer disputes between us individuals and local authorities if there is consultation before final decisions are taken; and, indeed, I think that that outcome is likely.<br><br>
I hope that local authorities will take advantage of this procedure and I shall be issuing guidance to them in due course on the best way of operating it.<br><br>
The third defect is that there are certain situations in which landlords who are willing to comply with the local authority's wishes can be obstructed by their tenants. The sort of situation I have in mind is where a landlord is being obliged to improve a house in a housing treatment area, and is willing to do so, but the works cannot be carried out satisfactorily with the tenant in the house, and the tenant refuses to vacate the house temporarily. In this situation the landlord is liable to be faced with a compulsory purchase order, because the obligation is on him, if he does not carry out the necessary works, but there is no specific provision enabling him to cope with the tenant's objections.<br><br>
Under the new provisions in Part III of the Bill—clauses 36 to 41—the landlord will be able to bring this type of problem before the sheriff, who will be able to grant the landlord an order for possession, or, as the case may be, to require the tenant to vacate the house temporarily to enable works to be carried out. The Sheriff will have full discretion to attach such conditions as he wishes to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0136">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
the granting of an order. If the sheriff considers that the tenant has a reasonable case for staying in the house it will be for the landlord to settle the issue with the local authority, if necessary at a compulsory purchase order inquiry. The landlord and tenant provisions are needed to prevent unnecessary obstruction of improvement and demolition work, but the final decision in all cases rests with the sheriff, so the rights of tenants are safeguarded.<br><br>
The fourth defect arises in areas for improvement. The maximum standard to which the local authority can compel improvement is the tolerable standard. Local authorities have taken the view that it is scarcely worth embarking on a housing treatment area for improvement if they cannot even ensure that at the end of the day every house will have a bath. I sympathise with this view.<br><br>
Under the new procedure the local authority will be able to require, in the case of houses with a life of 15 years or more, that the house is equipped with all the standard amenities, meets the tolerable standard and is in a good state of repair. We do not think that the local authority should be able to compel this higher standard in all cases. Where it considers that houses have a life of less than 15 years it need only secure that they are brought up to the tolerable standard and into a good state of repair.<br><br>
Other provisions are designed to ensure that no one suffers as a result of improvement or demolition work undertaken in a housing action area. The local authority will be obliged to rehouse anyone who is displaced as a result of such action and who cannot find suitable alternative accommodation. Anyone who is displaced will qualify for a home loss payment and a disturbance payment in the same way as if his house had been compulsorily purchased. No one should end up without a home as a result of improvement or demolition in a housing action area. The compensation arrangements which exist for houses in housing treatment areas will apply to housing in housing action areas, and the blight provisions of the Land Compensation (Scotland) Act 1973 will apply where there is any demolition.<br><br>
I think hon. Members will appreciate the difficulties of devising a procedure which gives adequate powers to local authorities while safeguarding the rights
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
of the individual, which offers the chance for swift action while allowing time for public consultation, and which gives sufficient financial incentives without throwing money away. I think we have here the right mixture.<br><br>
Apart from Clauses 44 and 45 dealing with local authority lending and rent income subsidy, Part IV contains miscellaneous and formal provisions. One merits special mention. We are empowering, under Clause 43, local authorities to act as the agents of private owners in arranging for the execution of house improvements. This will be by agreement with and at the expense of the owner.<br><br>
These are the major points in the Bill. Scotland's sub-standard houses cannot be removed by legislation alone. It is the Government's duty to provide the right legislative framework, to offer the necessary advice and encouragement to local authorities, and to provide the necessary financial support. In this Bill we are giving local authorities extended powers, improved procedures and financial encouragement to stop the slide into slumdom of a substantial number of the country's houses. Many of the proposals have been specially requested by local authorities in the light of their experience with the present improvement grant scheme and housing treatment area procedure. They were prepared in consultation with a working party of representatives of the local authorities associations and I am sure the Committee will join me in thanking them for giving us the benefit of their experience. This Bill will be welcomed by local authorities and by the families living in miserable conditions. I feel sure that they would join me in urging this Committee and the Standing Committee to deal with it as swiftly as proper consideration will allow.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish on behalf of the Opposition to welcome the Bill. As the right hon. Gentleman fairly said, the Bill closely follows the proposals put forward by the previous Government in relation to improvement of housing and helping housing generally within Scotland, and it is for these reasons that we very much welcome the proposals which the right hon. Gentleman has put before us today.<br><br>
I shall be listening with interest to what may be said from the other side of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0137">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
Committee, and in Standing Committee on the the Bill, because when we put forward these proposals in the Housing and Planning Bill, which was debated on the Floor of the House in February this year, one or two hon. Members opposite did not exactly wholly welcome some of the proposals in that Bill. The hon. Members for East Kilbride (Dr. Miller) had certain reservations about it and it will be interesting to see whether he pursues those reservations this morning. I see the hon. Member for Glasgow, Queen's Park (Mr. McElhone) smiling and nodding this morning. He was particularly forthcoming in the House on 5th February when he said about the Bill which we proposed:
<br><blockquote><p>"It will do little to help solve the housing problem in my constituency or in Scotland as a whole."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 5th February 1974; Vol. 868, <i>c</i>. 1133.]</p></blockquote>
I therefore find it very interesting that the hon. Gentleman's Party should now adopt the proposals of our Bill of a few months ago and embody them in the present Bill.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman said that he believed that it was better to embody most of his proposals in a separate Scottish Bill. However, it is a fact that many of the provisions, which are very important, were in our Bill and were debated in the House in February, and they should have remained in a United Kingdom Bill and should not have come forward in a separate Scottish Bill. This is particularly so in relation to house improvement grants which we had and which the present Government are, I am glad to say, continuing.<br><br>
With regard to house improvements grants, the Government announced a fortnight ago that the period for completing work should be extended to the end of September for those applications which had been approved up to the end of September last year. We welcome that very much. We had the point under consideration at the time of the General Election. Taking account of the particular difficulties regarding supply of raw materials and the problems of getting services and tradesmen—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Mr. Bruce Millan)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: And the three-day week.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>:—and other problems, an extension of this nature is very welcome.<br><br>
I am not in any sense carping at the Government for extending the period, but since the announcement was made I have received a considerable number of representations, as I am sure all hon. Members will have done, from constituents who fall just on the wrong side of the date line as their applications were approved just after the end of September last year. It is obvious that with any cut-off date some people fall on the wrong side of it. However, I put a point to the right hon. Gentleman which has been represented to me front my constituency within the last 24 hours. It concerns those applications which were approved after the end of September last, the applicants having every prospect of completing the work by the middle of June. But for reasons not related to the three-day week, which the hon. Member for Glasgow, Craigton (Mr. Millan) was murmuring about a few moments ago, the applicants will not be able to finish the work by 23rd or 24th June, as is necessary if they are to qualify for the 75 per cent. rate of grant.<br><br>
11.0 a.m.<br><br>
The strike of cement workers has caused disruption, and I know of many cases in which the improvements are virtually finished except for rough casting, but the strike has caused delay and the completion certificate cannot be issued till that work is done. Even if the strike is settled and supplies become available within the next few weeks I doubt whether the builders in a small way of business and carrying out this work will be able to get supplies of cement. I hope that the Government will have sympathy for the people who have had to face these difficulties.<br><br>
No one wants to see the work on house improvements discouraged. Many of the people who are having house improvements done are of small means and the £600 means a great deal to them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. T. G. D. Galbaith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would not one way out of the difficulty be to let the chopper fall in September and say that the work has to be finished in September? If the work is finished then the grant is payable and if it is not finished there is

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
no grant. Would not the better date be the finishing date rather than the date of application?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The fact that the date of application is the qualifying date has caused concern. Some people had no idea at the time of their applications that the date of 30th September or 1st October at the end of the day would have such an effect.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As far as I know there is no cut-off date after 24th June. The criterion is the date of the approval.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the work had to be completed by 23rd June.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that is right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman is causing confusion. My constituents understand the position to be that if the application was approved after 1st October the work had to be completed by 23rd June. Unless the work is completed by then they stand to lose £600 of grant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is perfectly true.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to explain to the hon. Gentleman the difficulties that some individuals face by reason of that cut-off date.<br><br>
The worry here is that the date of application should have been used rather than a general cut-off date that affected everybody regardless of when the application was made. People who put in applications in good faith after 1st October have been subjected to the same difficulties, and that is where concern has been expressed. I am not trying to be awkward. I am merely describing to the Committee what I am sure is the experience of many hon. Members—the genuine problems that have arisen as a result of the cut-off date being applied in this way. Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman will consider that matter further.<br><br>
Everyone in Scotland must appreciate the effort that has been put into housing improvement schemes in Scotland during the last three or four years. In 1968, 13,000 improvement schemes were approved; in 1970, 23,000; in 1971, 35,000; in 1972, 48,000; and in 1973, 92,000. Those figures show a remarkable increase over the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
years. They show the success of our policy of improving the housing stock in Scotland where so many houses are below tolerable standards. The devotion of so much public and private money to this end is a good use of resources.<br><br>
I come now to the Bill. With the exception of Clauses 44 and 45, only relatively marginal changes have been made to the Bill which the previous Government introduced. I welcome the increase in the number of houses that will be helped in Glasgow and also the increase in the grant up to 90 per cent in certain circumstances. These changes should be helpful.<br><br>
In dealing with housing action areas I hope that local authorities will be extremely sensitive to the human problems that are created by the carrying out of improvement schemes. The improvements are worth while and we welcome them, but difficulties sometimes arise when a tenant does not want to be accommodated elsewhere and the landlord has difficulty in getting him to move. In my constituency I know of tenants—perhaps a single old person—occupying a room or a couple of rooms who show great unwillingness to move from their homes which they have occupied for many years. Although at the end of the day the tenants will get improved accommodation a callous or thoughtless approach by the landlord can cause great fear and alarm.<br><br>
I hope that the social work departments of local authorities as well as the housing departments will be involved, so that people who are alarmed may know of the local authorities' genuine feelings of concern and desire to help and advise them on their rights. Many such people do not want to be rehoused permanently even in new council housing schemes. They want to come back to their own surroundings and be amongst their neighbours. I hope this will be dealt with as a physical problem of improving and adding to the housing stock. I was encouraged by what the right hon. Gentleman said about this. If the human problems are not fully taken into account improvement schemes may be held up and much suffering and worry will be caused.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman mentioned, when dealing with Clause 44, the amount of money that local authorities are lending to individuals for house improvements.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0139">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
May we have details of how the scheme is currently progressing and how he sees greater help being given? I should be grateful for clarification of exactly what is expected to result from Clause 44.<br><br>
I wish to ask one question on Clause 45. The Opposition have been concerned at the way in which the rent standstill has been applied. Would it not have been better to have applied the public money and resources necessary to give effect to the rent standstill to help those who are in particular need through the rent rebate scheme, rather than applying the money right across the board to help those for whom help is not so necessary as well as those for whom it is? We have severe reservations on the way in which the rent freeze has been applied.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman said that the effect of the rent freeze did not fall upon the rates. Although the major part of the cost will be covered by the subsidy, part will fall on the ratepayer. The present rise in rates is a matter of grave concern, yet the Government are putting this added burden on the Scottish ratepayer.<br><br>
In general, we welcome the Bill and I assure the right hon. Gentleman that in Committee we shall do all we can to improve it to ensure an increased rate of house improvement in Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Frank McElhone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to take part in the discussion on the Housing (Scotland) Bill. I take note of what the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) said about my comments during the Second Reading debate on the Housing and Planning Bill on 5th February. The hon. Member also referred to my having said that that Bill would not do a great deal for the housing problems in my constituency. Obviously, my views have somewhat changed. The situation has changed. At that time my hon. Friend the Member for East Kilbride (Dr. Miller) and I were concerned that there was not a separate Bill for Scotland. The Scottish attitude to housing is different from that of England and Wales. At that time there was no guarantee that people in housing action areas would be rehoused.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Teddy Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Rubbish!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McElhone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There was no guarantee in the Bill, and during the debate no
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
assurance was given of guaranteed rehousing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That matter could have been clarified if the hon. Gentleman had cared to write to the Minister or ask a question. The proposed Bill had such a guarantee. There was no question of any person being put out of his home without the right to be rehoused.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McElhone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can only refer back to the previous debates. I made that point and it was not clarified by the senior Minister at that time. I was worried that under the previous Bill a person could be evicted from his house within between two and four weeks. That is a serious complaint as it affects people in my area.<br><br>
11.15 a.m.<br><br>
I have a treatment area in my constituency which has caused a great deal of distress and hardship to people. People displaced because of housing action area proposals have been told, "Take this particular house, for if you do not do so you will be evicted." Assurances have been given by my right hon. Friend that there will be a guarantee of rehousing and of consideration for a person's needs. I am somewhat mollified by that assurance, and I know that this news will be welcomed by many people in my constituency who have raised these points with me—and did so particularly during the General Election.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barry Henderson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State will not have the ability to ensure that the consideration mentioned by the hon. Gentleman will mean that people will be treated in such a way, for that will be the business of the local authority. He should ask his right hon. Friend to be more specific in legislative terms.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McElhone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not disagree with the hon. Gentleman. Following experience with Tory controlled local authorities—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barry Henderson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In Glasgow?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McElhone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am saying that Glasgow people have faced great difficulties in the past in housing terms, and, indeed, still face difficulties. However, on balance the Housing Management Office and the Glasgow Corporation have done their utmost through redevelopment or other means, to accommodate people who have particular housing problems. I have no criticism of the Glasgow Corporation on
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0140">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
that score, and I think every other Glasgow Member will endorse that view.<br><br>
There are specific complaints by people who do not get the houses they desire in a certain area, but we must always consider the magnitude of the housing problem in Glasgow. On the other hand, we must remember that 150,000 council houses have been built and this is a great achievement. I hasten to say that those houses were built during the tour of the 1964–1970 Labour Government. There has been a genuine attempt by Labour administrations, and certainly by the Labour-controlled local authorities, to cope with the situation. Therefore, I am extremely pleased that the election results in Scotland have given such strong Labour representation in the local authorities, particularly in the Glasgow districts, so that people will be properly taken care of.<br><br>
I regret that there is no mention in the Bill of sheltered housing or housing of chronic sick and disabled persons. I have raised on previous occasions the fact that local authorities are not implementing the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act. It must be remembered that in Section 3 there is an obligation for local authorities to take action. The wording of that provision is "shall" rather than "may". However, not one of the major areas has attempted to carry out that legislation. I appreciate that it was a Private Member's measure, but, nevertheless, it is on the statute book. The last figures I received on this subject showed that 17 local authorities in Scotland, all of them rather small, had taken up their responsibilities in this respect.<br><br>
The Secretary of State must take on board the need to improve houses and to give grants for house repairs, but he must also consider the vitally important matter of community in housing terms. I am referring not just to the updating of housing standards but to the creation of conditions in which sheltered housing, accommodation for disabled people, and, indeed, the creation of a better standard of housing and environment, can be created for the people of our country. There is no point in talking of a notional figure of 500 houses in a housing action area without at the same time updating the schools and providing community centres and other facilities.<br><br>
We all know that areas such as the old Gorbals and other parts of the city of Glasgow—and this applies to other major
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
cities in Scotland—suffer from the lack of a proper environment. We also know that many of these areas—and I know that this will be endorsed by my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley (Mr. Robertson)—have great social work problems. There is vandalism by young offenders, many of whom come from deprived housing areas with poor social environments. The English Housing Bill spells out the social needs of an area. Therefore, I am sorry to see that the Housing (Scotland) Bill makes no mention of social need. This aspect is as important as bathrooms, lavatories, sinks and all the other important installations within a house.<br><br>
I must emphasise that we have still not examined the subject of the cost yardstick, and, because of the inflationary pressures on housing improvements, we have not considered fully the effects of the indicative cost procedure. We cannot keep talking about giving grants to local authorities unless we examine the two basic criteria in determining whether a local authority should go ahead with a viable scheme. The Bill contains many valuable provisions but it is substantially weak on those two basic points.<br><br>
I regret that my constituency, which was one of the first comprehensive development areas after the 1939–45 war, contains some new housing schemes which can only be described as deplorable. The last scheme to be completed has caused a great deal of hardship and distress because the Conservative Government cut housing under the indicative cost procedure. I could show the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor) one street in which the people are expected to live in birdcage-type structures and which contain corridor-like bedrooms in which the occupants, who may be old or sick, are subjected to deafening noise of the sort one would find in a compression chamber. This is a pertinent point related to the indicative cost procedure, and it has had a severe effect on housing standards. I welcome the improved grants as a result of which an additional 45,000 houses in Glasgow will now be improved.<br><br>
However, I feel that unless my right hon. Friend can substantially revise the indicative cost procedure the schemes envisaged in the Bill for housing action areas will have no great effect on the environment. We must remember the time it takes to obtain a compulsory purchase order in the present housing treatment

areas, and the fact that St. Andrew's House and the Department of the Environment still have to operate an archaic planning procedure. The time it has taken to pass planning proposals, even for only a few houses, is far too long. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Pollock (Mr. White) has a treatment area in his constituency and it has taken four years or so to get to a stage of beginning only a handful of houses. Therefore the planning procedures at St. Andrew's House must be carefully reviewed. I am not apportioning blame in this matter, since the situation has existed under both Conservative and Labour Governments, but I believe we must speed up planning procedures. This point has already been emphasised quite clearly in another area of activity, namely, the subject of North Sea Oil and related industries.<br><br>
The problem which has bedevilled the city of Glasgow—and this applies particularly to areas such as Castlemilk and Drumchapel—is that if urgent action is not taken in these housing estates, involving 30,000 or 40,000 people, they could develop into ghetto areas. As a result of the Conservative Government's iniquitous rent legislation, which has forced up council house rents to an extortionate level, the young artisan and the higher-paid engineer has moved out of the area and bought a flat or house somewhere else. Those areas are left with low-paid or unemployed people, including disabled persons and pensioners. Unless we get the right social mix we shall not achieve the right balance in such areas.<br><br>
I hope that this Bill will encompass—and such a provision was included in the English legislation and also, I think, in previous Scottish housing measures—some incentive for housing associations to move into areas such as Castlemilk and Drumchapel. Perhaps incentives in the form of 100 per cent. loans or lower rates of interest could be offered to these associations. Unless we take urgent action to cope with these social problems in the near future social work departments will have a very heavy burden to bear in these ghetto areas of the future. I want to see housing associations brought into these areas so that there can be, alongside the labourers and unemployed persons, a mixture of professional people and highly skilled workers. This is what we must aim at or we shall have a reincarnation of Blackhill
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
and similar areas which are all too common in Glasgow and other densely populated parts of Scotland.<br><br>
I do not want to speak for too long, although I have a good deal to say on this important Bill. I hope that my right hon. Friend will examine the question of 100 per cent. rating of empty houses on the fringe of housing action areas. The Conservative Government's White Paper advised local authorities to take action in this respect under Part V of the Housing Act 1957. Local treasurers in England, Wales and Scotland have been looking for this power in a definitive way so that they may be able to rate empty houses. I can quote an example in my constituency where there has been a speculative attempt by an owner to obtain an exorbitant price for a property which is 100 years old.<br><br>
I conclude by saying that I welcome the improvements in the Bill, for it contains a good deal more assurance for a better deal than was contained in the previous Conservative legislation. I repeat my welcome for the fact that some 45,000 houses will be improved. However, the English legislation spells out many matters more clearly than they are spelled out in this Bill. For example, in the English measure there is an obligation to publish details of housing action areas, whereas in the Scottish legislation this provision is not as wide ranging. The English Bill says that the fact should be published in two newspapers, one of which should be a local newspaper. That provision is more specific.<br><br>
I consider that the information should be published in a local newspaper. I think it can be said that not many people in my constituency read <i>The Glasgow Herald,</i> whereas they might well see the item if published in the local Press. If there is publication in this way, we shall be more likely to receive the participation of people affected by any scheme. This is essential if a scheme is to be successful and is to be completed within the time required.<br><br>
There are many more matters which I could mention, but I end by giving a qualified welcome to this very important Bill and hope that it will be improved in Committee.</span></p>
<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Myer. I have listened with great interest to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Queen's Park (Mr. McElhone). I know that his constituency has many and varied
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0142">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
housing problems. In pursuance of my point of order, Sir Myer, I ask whether there is any restriction on the length of speeches made in this Committee or whether Members are asked to exercise self-discipline, since many hon. Members wish to take part in the debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson). His point of order is one that could have been avoided if he had studied the Standing Orders of the House and of Committees. If he does so he will see that there is no limit placed upon the length of speeches. The Committee has been delayed, if for only a few seconds, by the hon. Member putting what I consider to be a spurious point of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Steel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I give a general welcome to the Bill, but I agree with the hon. Member for Glasgow, Queen's Park (Mr. McElhone) that we want to see some improvements made in Committee.<br><br>
First I welcome the new procedure about giving more information to those people within housing action areas. Second, the Secretary of State pinpointed Clause 43, which enables a local authority to move in and to act as agent on behalf of people who are incapable of going through all the work and turmoil that is required—for example, the elderly or those living alone—prior to having a house improved. That is a significant step forward and one that is welcome.<br><br>
I shall make a short speech on one basic and important point. When I first went to the House I happened to represent—and I take no pride in this fact—a housing authority in Scotland that had within its bounds the highest percentage of unfit houses—namely, Galashiels. Since the Cullingworth Report there has been considerable progress. However, the figures in the 1971 census indicate that whereas 11.7 per cent. of Glasgow's houses did not have the use of an internal wc, the figure for Galashiels was 19.5 per cent. In 1971 there were still one in five houses in the town that lacked that amenity.<br><br>
Ever since the publication of the White Paper Galashiels has been making representations to the Scottish Office. In my presence the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger), who was the Minister responsible, encouraged the local government representatives to try to make further progress. The result is that Galashiels has
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
dealt in large measure with those areas that can be dealt with by demolition.<br><br>
There is still more demolition work to be done, but the latest figure that I have is that between 700 and 800 houses, which are not massed together and which are not susceptible to treatment by demolition, will have to be dealt with by improvement under Clause 16.<br><br>
The difficulty is that, whereas in many of the big cities and in the larger burghs we can talk about housing action areas as a meaningful concept, it so happens that in Galashiels, and, I suspect, in other towns in my constituency where there may be less of a problem, it is no longer possible to deal with the matter by the housing action area procedure. The map which was shown to the hon. Member for Ayr in the Town Chambers in Galashiels showed that the houses which had been identified as a result of the survey carried out under the 1969 Act as being below the tolerable standard were scattered all over the burgh. We are, therefore, faced with the situation in which some procedure must be found to enable the burgh to tackle the problem as a whole.<br><br>
That could be done by declaring the whole town to be an action area. That would be a drastic step, but it could be done under the terms of Clause 16. The alternative is that the Secretary of State must be given powers, which do not exist now, to deal with circumstances such as those which prevail in Galashiels. That is important because, as the Secretary of State has outlined, there is a difference between the grant that is available to private individuals from the Exchequer subsidy and the grant available to local authorities when the houses concerned are within a housing action area. Houses which are owned by a local authority and which are outside a housing action area will get only a 37 per cent. Exchequer subsidy for improvement work. That will not be a great encouragement to a local authority such as Galashiels to buy up more houses and to improve them.<br><br>
We are left with a situation in which a small local authority with a limited investment and rate expenditure ability must tackle a substantial social problem. There is a case for amending Clause 16 so as to give the Secretary of State wider powers. It has been pointed out to me that Clause 34 of the English Bill more nearly meets the situation I have described. It reads as follows:—
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0143">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 27</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"Where a report with respect to an area consisting primarily of housing accommodation is submitted to the local authority within whose district the area lies by a person or persons appearing to the authority to be suitably qualified … and, upon consideration of the report and of any other information in their possession, the authority are satisfied that, having regard to—
<ol>
<li>the physical state of the housing accommodation in the area as a whole, and</li>
<li>social conditions in the area.</li></ol>
the requirement in subsection (2) below is fulfilled with respect to the area, the authority may cause the area to be defined on a map and by resolution declare it to be a housing action area. "</p></blockquote>
That is a far looser and wider definition than that which appears in Clause 16 of the Housing (Scotland) Bill, which says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Where a local authority are satisfied (<i>a</i>) that the houses, or the greater part of the houses, in any area in their district lack one or more of the standard amenities …"</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to interrupt on detailed Committee points, but as a number of such matters have been raised this morning whilst comparing our Bill rather adversely with the English Bill, and as on virtually all those points the Scottish Bill has provisions similar to those in the English Bill, I draw the attention of the hon. Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles (Mr. Steel) to Clause 18(2), which does what he wants us to do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 18 authorises the Secretary of State to give directions regarding the waiving of requirements. If that meets the case that I have outlined, I am delighted. But why have not the authorities been told about the provisions of Clause 18? They have been making repeated representations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That may be a fair point, but Clause 18 is one improvement that this Government have introduced to the previous Government's Bill. I am glad that the hon. Gentleman recognises it as an improvement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister of State is telling me that Clause 18 will enable the Secretary of State to say that all the 750 houses scattered throughout Galashiels may receive the financial treatment that applies to housing action areas as defined by Clause 16, that meets the point that I am making. Is the Minister saying that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am saying that Clause 18 has been put in to meet the circumstances of places such as Galashiels. I think that the local authorities will now want to con-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
sider that provision to determine whether they want to take advantage of it when the Bill is enacted. The Clause has been introduced to deal specifically with the point that the hon. Gentleman has raised. That is the point I am making.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that event I shall leave the matter, except to add that I hope that the clause will be interpreted as meaning that Galashiels, when it submits its housing proposals, will be assured that the houses which are still in its stock and below the tolerable standard will receive, whether the houses are owned by private individuals or by the local authority, the higher rate of assistance that is outlined for housing action areas. Now that is on the record, I welcome very much the provisions of Clause 18. As many representations have been made ever since the White Paper was published, that fact might have been related to the burghs concerned. I shall be meeting the representatives of the Galashiels local authority on Friday and I shall be happy to relay that information to them.<br><br>
A lot of the concentration on house improvement work has naturally and properly been devoted to the big cities, but there are in the counties of Scotland what I would call the picture postcard slums. Such slums are often the more difficult to deal with because the houses concerned are not massed together. I hope very much that we may, as a result of the Secretary of State using his discretion, succeed in eliminating the picture postcard slums at the same time as the slums that exist in the larger cities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Doig</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I first refer to the Statement made by the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) when he spoke about the cut-off date for all house improvement grants. I have a letter from the Scottish Office which was written on 9th May in reply to a letter which I wrote to the Scottish Office on 22nd April. It refers to the delays encountered in the completion of improvement works. It says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Whilst we felt unable to go as far as you suggested in extending the period of availability of the higher 75 per cent. grant, you will probably have noticed that Willie Ross announced in reply to a Question on 30th April that provisions will be introduced enabling private owners in Scotland, whose application for grant at the preferential rate were approved on or before 30th September 1973 to receive grant at the higher rate even though the work is completed after 22nd June this year. "</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0144">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 29</span>
The hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns appeared to be saying that regardless of when work on a house had been approved, if it had not been completed by the 22nd June the grant would not be available.<br><br>
I have looked through the Bill and I cannot find anything which supports my right hon. Friend's statement. I should like to know by what means the Secretary of State proposes to carry out the assurance that he gave in reply to a Question on 30th April relating to improvement grants.<br><br>
In the letter which I wrote to the Scottish Office I said that I thought that the 75 per cent. grant should be extended for a longer period. No one doubts that such grants serve a useful purpose. The officials who have dealt with them have admitted that it would probably be wise to extend them further. However, something still must be done to implement what my right hon. Friend said in reply to the Question on 30th April and to extend the 75 per cent. grants for an even longer period.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend has said that there will be no improvement grant for a second bathroom. The word "bathroom" is used rather loosely in Scotland. Many people talk about toilet accommodation as a bathroom. Perhaps "bathroom" has been used in that loose way. I believe that it is a great mistake to exclude bathrooms from improvement grants. Separate toilet accommodation is fully justified in addition to a bathroom. I should be disappointed if the Government were to remove from improvement grants applications of that kind.<br><br>
That would be a mistake.<br><br>
11.45 a.m.<br><br>
I compliment the Government on their decision to introduce a separate Scottish Bill on an important matter such as housing rather than have a few clauses in a British Bill.<br><br>
We all know from experience that our chances of putting forward the opinions and grievances of our constituents are much greater in this Committee than in the House. I have tried times without number to make a speech in the House without a chance of being called, discovering subsequently that I was so far down the list that if the House had sat for a week I still would not have been called.<br><br>
I want to take up a matter to which my right hon. Friend referred only briefly—the question of home loss payments. He said that they would be the same under the Bill
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
as they were under the Land Compensation (Scotland) Act 1973. My right hon. Friend's officials will know, if he does not, that I have written many letters on the subject to his Department. Great troubles are being caused in my constituency, and no doubt in others, by the legislation.<br><br>
It apparently lays down that some indication must be given to the public of their rights under the Act. The Government's interpretation of that was to put two advertisements in two national newspapers. The local authority supplemented that advertising by putting two public notices in the local Press. The set-up in Dundee must be unlike that in Glasgow. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Queen's Park (Mr. McElhone) said that not many people in his constituency read <i>The Glasgow Herald</i>. Very few people in Dundee read that national newspaper, or any other national newspaper, but they practically all read the local Press.<br><br>
However, I would qualify that remark by saying that only a tiny minority—probably about 1 per cent.—read through all the formal public notices, especially when they start with the typical words " Hereby declare so and so, under Section so and so, of such and such an Act ". It never occurs to them that the notice applies to them, because that is as far as they read.<br><br>
The council decided to clear out an area in one of the black housing areas in my constituency, called Beech Wood. It transpired that those living there were entitled to compensation of about £400 each. Precious few seem to have applied for it. The only ones who have done so are those who were affected very recently, and who applied recently; but the bulk of them were affected some considerable time ago.<br><br>
Even the people who inserted the notice —the Town Clerk's department—admitted to me that they had not realised that the legislation affected tenants. If the people who were responsible for inserting the notice did not realise that, what was the chance of the ordinary public? To add insult to injury, the department issued a document which was supposed to contain notes of guidance to the public on home loss payments under the Act. In the document, the department set out all the rules and regulations, but it sent them out after the time had expired for those concerned legally to claim the compensation.<br><br>
For a working family, £400 is a great deal of money. A number of the families in question have already been to see me
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0145">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 31</span>
about the problem, and I have no doubt that many more will come to see me when they hear about it. If the Government wanted people to know about the compensation and took the trouble of inserting two advertisements in national newspapers, I presume that they wanted to pay out the money to those who were entitled to it. The local authority also went to the trouble of inserting a notice in the local Press twice, but the people who should have had compensation did not receive it, because they did not know that they were entitled to it, and when they found out about their entitlement, through a letter from the Town Clerk's department, the same letter told them that the time had expired. That is ridiculous. It is like robbing someone of £400 and then rubbing his nose in the dirt by drawing his attention to the fact. My right hon. Friend should use the Bill to rectify that situation if it can be rectified in no other way.<br><br>
I have pointed out to our Town Clerk in Dundee that it could be argued that what happened was an act of negligence by his staff. He told me that although they were not aware that the people concerned were entitled to the compensation they usually received notification from the housing office when people were so entitled, and they had not had such notification. I wrote to the Director of Housing, who replied that notification was given. Therefore, they had their attention specifically drawn to the matter.<br><br>
Clause 19(5)(<i>b</i>) lays an obligation on the local authority not merely to advertise in newspapers, but to:
<br><blockquote><p>"serve on every owner, lessee and occupier of any premises to which the draft resolution relates a notice stating the effect of the resolution ".</p></blockquote>
I take that to mean that the Bill lays an obligation on the Town Clerk in future to notify every individual affected. Presumably, that means everyone who is displaced and has a right to compensation. That appears to cover the situation for the future. But what about past cases? If the people who insert the notices, people who are legally trained and qualified, do not know of the right to compensation, there is an excuse for the general public.<br><br>
There is an obligation on the Government to follow the principle they have propounded in the past, that they want people to receive money to which they are entitled by law. If it can be shown, as I am sure it can, that members of the public had
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
no means of knowing of the situation, because their first intimation came after the time for applying had expired, the Government must either use their present powers to allow the money to be paid, or, if they do not have such powers, realise that the Bill is a heaven-sent opportunity to provide themselves with such powers. They should include in it a clause or a schedule enabling the people of whom I have spoken to be paid the money.<br><br>
I give a general welcome to the rest of the Bill. We do not discuss housing nearly enough. A few newspapers have written, and a few Opposition spokesmen have said, that Dundee has too many houses. That is far from true. We have a certain number of sub-standard houses that cannot be let, but we still have hundreds and hundreds of people in our city who want a council house but cannot obtain one. Although we keep being told about all these empty houses, at least 75 per cent. of those who come to see me week after week want me to help them to obtain a corporation house. Many say that they will accept a house of any kind. The story that we have too many council houses is a myth. It is true that we have a few that nobody wants. They are sub-standard houses, most of them built during the war. Some have no timber in them, but are concrete throughout.<br><br>
The Government are considering an application by the local authority to demolish some of those houses. I do not blame people for refusing to go into them. Most of the houses are damp and uncomfortable. I should not like to live in one, and I should not ask anybody else to.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Teddy Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are all interested in what is happening in Dundee and other cities. Is the problem solely one of the construction of the houses, or is it also one of the area and the amenities provided?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doig</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The construction of the houses causes the area's amenity problems. Only the most desperate people will accept occupancy of sub-standard houses, and the environmental problems then result. If the houses had been in a proper condition in the first place, the environmental problems would not have arisen.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Reid</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I, too, am very glad to give a general welcome to the various proposals in the Bill. While it is based on measures of the previous Government I am glad to see that its adoptive father, unlike the previous Government, has not claimed
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0146">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 33</span>
that it will cure Scotland's slums within the next five years. The situation in those slums is too serious for that.<br><br>
I congratulate the Secretary of State on embodying his proposals in a Scottish Bill rather than combining them in a United Kingdom measure. As the hon. Member for Glasgow, Queen's Park (Mr. McElhone) said, attitudes towards housing and the problems in housing in Scotland are different—too often, as we know to our cost, in human terms, tragically different.<br><br>
The Bill introduces some useful measures. Before we can tackle the slum problem in Scotland we have to define the areas of need. Some 225,000 sub-standard houses—sub-standard by the relatively easy-going standards of the Scottish Office—come within the remit of the Bill. They are the root cause of many of the current problems in Scottish society—an environment in the cities which offers no hope to people living in it, an environment of squalor and dirt and degradation of the back courts. Too often people abandon hope as soon as they set up house there.<br><br>
In principle, the Bill is right. It concentrates on the areas of greatest need in Scottish housing. I especially welcome the inclusion of the extra houses in Glasgow. They may save it from further decline and social misery.<br><br>
12 noon<br><br>
It is also right that we should concentrate on the work of regeneration and renewal and I welcome the grants which are to be available. The Bill may yet help retain some community life for people in inner city areas. <i>The Scotsman</i> carried an article on 25th April part of which stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"Urban renewal, of course, has become something of a dirty word, synonymous with the wholesale destruction of close-knit communities and the erection of sprawling housing estates with vast populations which not surprisingly breed acute social problems. The Luftwaffe could hardly have done a more effective job on certain parts of Glasgow…"</p></blockquote>
We know that to our cost.<br><br>
We welcome the proposals that work will continue on rehabilitation as well as on demolition.<br><br>
We also welcome the Bill as a useful measure in regard to social factors. It provides accommodation and prevents the lapse of many inner city houses into further decay, and it avoids the upheaval of demolition and the necessary decanting of vast numbers of people from inner
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 34</span>
cities. It may yet stop the heart being torn out of cities.<br><br>
I turn to some specific points. We welcome the provision to compensate local authorities for the rent freeze. This is right, but the compensation amounts to only 80 per cent., and this still leaves £1 million to be obtained from local rates.<br><br>
We also welcome the powers to local authorities to offer low-start mortgages to enable people to buy or improve their homes. Too many young Scots have not the income to make up the usual building society repayments. It is also especially right that a grant of 75 per cent., up to £800, should be made available for repair work. Too many folk, especially old folk, in Scots society are unable to pay for necessary repairs, but the problem here is that the grant is to be paid only in respect of general improvement in housing action areas. Many old-age pensioners cannot be bothered with the physical inconvenience of general improvements, yet desperately need immediate running repairs to their homes. Perhaps grant should be given irrespective of area or location.<br><br>
My party welcomes as a necessary measure of social justice the restriction of grants to first homes and the ending of indiscriminate handouts, which was long overdue. There has been misuse of public funds involving second homes as well as grants to developers who wish merely to improve houses and then sell at a profit.<br><br>
We appreciate, in the present United Kingdom financial climate, the Government's difficulty in fixing the date for completion of existing 75 per cent. grant work. We welcome the extension for those who received grant approval before 30th September 1973, but it seems that problems may arise. Some local authorities were so snowed under with applications that many were still in the pending tray when the Minister called "Time". There is a danger of some small injustice for those whose grants were approved after September and who now have work in progress. They have in effect now lost 25 per cent. of the grant, a considerable sum which some of them can ill afford. If the Bill can allow up to 90 per cent. grant under certain conditions in housing action areas, why should there be a perhaps stingy attitude towards work already started?<br><br>
Much previous improvement work has been ill organised in Scotland and there has been disturbance and inconvenience. There has been a lack of skilled labour and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0147">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 35</span>
all sorts of jobbing firms, some inexperienced, have come in and have often made considerable profits.<br><br>
I received a letter from the Burgh Architect of Alloa relating to a modernisation contract. The letter states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The … contract is a fairly extensive one and unfortunately many tenants have been upset rather more than was necessary, due perhaps to the lack of liaison and co-operation between the various trades under the control of the main contractor and bad workmanship. Bad workmanship has resulted in leaking pipes and couplings which has a dreadful effect on tenants."</p></blockquote>
Although I do not wish to deprecate the need for improvement work—we welcome the work—I hope that, in future, improvement schemes are put on a more efficient basis.<br><br>
I welcome the Secretary of State's assurance about consultation with people involved in improvement schemes. In the past there has often been an attitude of "What is good for them, not what they want" on the part of those drawing up a scheme. People who are affected by the schemes should be involved from the earliest possible moment. I would like to see measures to ensure that they are brought in earlier than at present for talks. In this way people living in the locality can have an influence on the improvement schemes and on the way they will work.<br><br>
There is also the problem that different levels of grants may cause social divisions. No rigid figure has been placed on the size of housing action areas. In large cities, such as Glasgow, with tenement properties, there are "good" streets and "bad" streets juxtapositioned. If three different levels of grant apply this can lead to feelings of injustice and friction and at the end of the day the councils will have to carry the can. I hope that in such closely knit areas the geographical unit will be drawn wide.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Queen's Park referred to the need for sheltered housing within a measure such as this and I agree that that is sensible.<br><br>
Taking all the proposals together I believe that the Bill provides some useful measures against what the right hon. Gentleman has called the slide into "slumdom" However, there are several problems which may call for radical measures. The whole of the Scottish housing problem in the past thirty years has been concerned with building for rent; 700,000 apartments and houses have been built and they are now a grim legacy.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 36</span>
Tackling the problems involved is rather like painting the Forth Bridge: as soon as one section has been dealt with it is necessary to start again on another. Many of the new estates are as grim as anything in Eastern Europe and there are fears that many of the new housing estates may be the slums of tomorrow. They have few amenities and no sense of community, and they generate social problems of drunkenness, hooliganism and crime, problems which the estates were meant to help solve. Therefore, while we are thinking this morning about tackling overcrowding and taking action against stinking, vermin-ridden tenements our major cities may be facing new problems.<br><br>
We are in mid course of co-ownership between purely private and public housing. There is need for continuing expansion of private building and a much closer integration of all three types of development in future housing plans. However, in the meantime, and pending the transfer of housing decisions back to a Scottish Assembly with both fiscal powers and a determination to give higher priority than Westminster, we accept this Bill as a useful interim step, and I hope that it will be implemented quickly and effectively.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Selby</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Bill and the problems to which it relates affect my constituency to a large extent. Unfortunately, in the past some people have through propoganda depicted Govan as being the most derelict area in Europe. We have some well-built houses, some badly built houses and some terrible slums but, nevertheless, it is not the most derelict area in Europe.<br><br>
The Bill covers many matters. One. which disturbs me, is a question of finance, There is a reference to loan charges which have to be paid over a certain period of time. I served on Glasgow Corporation for a short period. During that time I discovered that one of the biggest charges on Glasgow's rates was interest charges on housing expenditure. I am sure, having listened to yesterday's debate in the House on defence, that the time has now arrived that money advanced for housing should be interest free as is money for defence.<br><br>
I am also concerned about speeding up rehousing of people. The Bill refers to a reasonable time, but I do not know what is meant by this. Does it mean three months, or three years, or is it an indefinite period? When I served on Glasgow

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 37</span>
Corporation for a short time I found the greatest burden was interest rates for money borrowed for housing.<br><br>
A fortnight ago I visited a building in Helen Street in Govan. The building is due for demolition. I do not know how long it has been due for demolition and I do not know how long a reasonable time is, but from what I have been told people there have been living in terrible conditions. There were all sorts of defects in the property, and other problems. I received a letter from the Director of Environmental Health, Glasgow Corporation, about the building. Part of the letter states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The ashbin shelter accommodation for the property was removed when the adjacent tenement was demolished and the refuse bins presently provided are being overturned by vandals etc., causing gross accumulations. The Cleansing Department has arranged to remove the refuse from the court and provide new bins where required.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>A burst water supply pipe in the unoccupied shop at 34 Helen Street was intimated to the factor on 3rd inst. and has now been repaired.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Two bottom lengths of the back sink conductor are missing permitting waste water to discharge over court and the Building Department have been intimated to carry out an immediate repair.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Follow up visits to the property will be maintained and every effort will be made to maintain reasonable conditions in the property until all the tenants are rehoused."</p></blockquote>
Parts of the building were occupied as a shop and there were defects in those parts. This illustrates the sort of conditions people are living in. How long do they have to go on living in such conditions? Some consideration should be given now to possibly rehousing people so that they can live in decent surroundings, rather than the sort of conditions to which I have referred.<br><br>
There is also the question of offering temporary accommodation for people. We as Socialists did our best to accommodate people in the best possible conditions, as we did when the Ugandan Asians came to Glasgow as refugees in spite of the hostility of some of the supporters of the Conservative Party. Arrangements should be made to provide temporary accommodation if necessary.<br><br>
There are also cases of people who are to be rehoused and who are entitled to compensation. Some people are being rehoused in properties which are due to come down within a few years. In some cases people cannot get the compensation under the blight Act unless the property concerned has been occupied by them for over five years. I know of a family offered accom
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 38</span>
modation in an area with a life span of less than five years. If they take this accommodation they will have to move twice. I fear that they will not get the compensation twice, because the property involved is due to come down within two or three years. What is to happen to such people? What sort of compensation are they to get? I hope that such problems can be examined while we are considering the Bill.<br><br>
Complaints are being received from people who have received intimations from the rent officer that he wishes to measure their houses. I am told that the rent freeze is only temporary. This may be so, depending on the results of the next election which I hope —I know—we shall win. I hope that rent officers can be instructed not to frighten people and that there is provision written into the Bill to make the rent freeze permanent.<br><br>
We in Govan fought strenuously and continuously for two years against the Tory Housing Finance Bill, but unfortunately it was approved. If anyone else tries to impose rent increases, we in Govan will do our best to see that they are defeated.<br><br>
It is time that the Labour Party seriously considered the public ownership of tenanted property.</span></p>
<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Ancram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I, too, welcome the general intentions of the Bill. As my hon. Friend the Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) said, the intentions of the Bill were originally the intentions of the previous administration. Few of us on the Opposition side of the Committee have any general objections to it. There are, however, certain points that must be made.<br><br>
I support those who have spoken about the present improvement grants. I understand that the Secretary of State has extended them to approvals granted before the end of September of last year. I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman will appreciate that many approvals were granted in the two months following upon the end of September and that work was started on the improvements in good faith that at the end of the day the occupiers would receive the full grant. These occupiers are not the sort of people whom hon. Members on the Government side want to squeeze. They are not the rich whom they would like to make squeal. The vast
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0149">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 39</span>
majority of them are using their life savings to improve their houses on the understanding that they will get the full grant.<br><br>
I ask the right hon. Gentleman seriously to consider whether a better criteria for deciding whether an approval should be extended are that work has been done, the house has been partially improved but the work will not be completed by 23rd June for reasons outside the control of the occupiers of those houses.<br><br>
My hon. Friend for North Angus and Mearns mentioned the unfortunate dispute at the APC cement works in my constituency. That dispute has made the situation more difficult. I have told both sides in the dispute that if there is anything I can do to help in resolving the dispute as quickly as possible I am available at any time. The dispute continues and the supply of cement in Scotland is severely curtailed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. J. Bruce-Gardyne</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon Friend aware that because of the antics of the Price Commission it is likely that there will be shortly substantially more severe shortages of cement in Scotland? The Price Commission is hell bent on enforcing conditions in which the cement plant in Scotland will have to close down.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ancram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making that clear.<br><br>
I ask the Secretary of State to consider extending grants to people who have started improvements. That plea has come from both sides of the Committee, and it has come with what I take to be the collective, unanimous voice of the Scottish National Party, unless the hon. Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. Reid) was indulging in the Royal "We". I do not think he was. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will accept this as a genuine plea from all parties.<br><br>
I should like to utter a word of warning to the Committee. It is easy to talk of large-scale improvements, but we can learn lessons from the operation of the present improvement scheme, especially in areas like my constituency where too much was attempted too quickly, with too few resources and materials and too few people to do the work. The result is that many houses which were renovated have been left in an incomplete condition. The workmanship is bad, pipes are unconnected, and in two cases, because of bad workman
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 40</span>
ship, new water tanks have burst and flooded houses which have been renovated.<br><br>
The basic reason for bad workmanship is that there are not many firms available to do this kind of work. The firms available had so much to do in such a short time that they raced through the schemes without regard to good workmanship and finishing the job properly. Several tenants of council houses in my constituency have been to see me recently to complain about the state in which their houses have been left and about the length of time for which their houses have been incomplete. Workmen have come in one week and not come back again for six weeks because they have been moved elsewhere in the county. I hope that these problems will be watched carefully by local authorities and also by St. Andrew's House.<br><br>
I have two specific comments to make on the Bill. One matter was raised by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Queen's Park (Mr. McElhone), and I support him. The Bill restricts the declaration of housing areas on criteria which are purely physical. The tolerable standard is based on whether the house contains a bath and certain amenities. The Housing Bill, which deals with England and Wales, goes further and allows local authorities to take into account the general social conditions of the area. This Bill should do the same, for two reasons.<br><br>
First, unless the local authority is able to look at broader criteria it will find difficulty in drawing up plans to define areas. It will always be restricted to particular houses in particular conditions. As a result of this restricting definition proportionally fewer areas will be treated in Scotland than in England. Secondly, the time has come to accept that tolerable conditions depend not merely on the house but equally on environmental and social conditions. Where a house is desperately overcrowded the conditions are intolerable, whether or not the house happens to meet the standards set by the Bill. I hope that this matter will be seriously considered. Again, the plea has been made from both sides of the Committee. The danger is that if something is not done about this matter there will be houses which are technically up to standard but are massively overcrowded, and there will be a quick degeneration to the slum conditions which the right hon. Gentleman said that it was the purpose of the Bill to eliminate.<br><br>
My most important reservation about
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0150">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 41</span>
the Bill arises out of the six-month period from the passing of the draft resolution to the time when the resolution is made final. That is a period of danger. During that period the draft resolution has no legal status. I realise that the period is required to allow public notice to be given and to give time for consultation. The Bill does not allow local authorities during that six-month period to issue control of occupation orders. That means that for six and possibly seven months the forthcoming order is known about and the landlord is forewarned. There may be changes in tenure outwith the control and often the knowledge of the local authority. That creates a field day for unscrupulous landlords, of whom there are far too many in Scottish cities. It gives the unscrupulous landlord the chance of a glorious and uncontrolled last fling.<br><br>
Under the Housing Bill, the moment the first resolution is passed it has legal status, and from the moment the first resolution is put forward local authorities can introduce occupation control orders. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will seriously reconsider this matter, otherwise this Bill is in danger of creating a heyday for unscrupulous developers and landlords.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James White</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted by what the Secretary of State said this morning. I speak with some authority because I have received communications from him about the Old Swan. Unlike my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Queen's Park (Mr. McElhone), I am critical of Glasgow Corporation. That Old Swan building was started in 1970, yet now, nearly four and a half years later, not one tradesman has moved into the building. There are two people at the top of the building who are continually at me, and I do not blame them. I will not go into detail, but the police and the fire brigade were called on 10 occasions in one month. The police assisted people and the firemen put out fires, but I should not like to live there with my family. I should be afraid to sleep at night because of the fire risk.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McElhone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend criticised Glasgow Corporation. In certain cases the corporation can be criticised, but I am sure my hon. Friend will agree that the Old Swan is not just the fault of Glasgow Corporation. The trouble lies in the antiquated planning procedures and the fact that approval was held up for so
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 42</span>
long by the Scottish Office under the previous Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. White</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I differ from my hon. Friend. I criticise Glasgow Corporation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Teddy Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The difference is that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. White) knows the facts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. White</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am placed in the awkward position of having to agree with a Tory Member.<br><br>
A year ago the estimate for the treatment area was £1 million, but today we are talking in terms of £2 million.<br><br>
I cannot afford to miss the opportunity to talk about the real priority of housing. Reference has been made to Blackhill and Priesthill Park. My fear is that parts of my constituency will develop on those lines. Sir Myer, you will appreciate what happened in Glasgow in 1945. The cry was for houses at any price to get people out of rat infested, crumbling tenements. Today we are suffering from that emergency. I do not exaggerate when I say that I can go into houses where water runs down the wall over my hands. It is unfair that people should be forced to pay rent and rates for accommodation like that. The scheme in Pollok is the most poorly built scheme in Scotland—it is much worse than Drumchapel and Easterhouse.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McElhone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Red Road?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. White</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Red Road scheme is comparatively new, and is a much better area.</span></p>
<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can assure the hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. White) that I shall see he gets a fair crack of the whip during the Committee's deliberations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. White</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a great consolation, Sir Myer, and I appreciate it.<br><br>
The problems of Priesthill are difficult, and I have spoken to the Minister of State, Lord Hughes, about this matter and also to my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Craigton (Mr. Millan). I should like to see a Government inquiry into such areas. I refer to Ferguslei Park, Blackhill and Priesthill. The vast majority of people in those areas are good working-class people, but they are not allowed to lead their lives as they should. I accept that there are always anti-social types,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0151">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 43</span>
and I am quickly coming to the conclusion that we must do something with them to allow other people to live in peace and quiet. No wonder children grow up to be delinquents when they live in these areas and have very little to occupy them. Their parents lose interest in their accommodation and do not bother even to keep their houses clean. I shudder to think how this problem has its effects in terms of the National Health Service. I know that many women constantly attend surgeries for treatment for their nerves, and that is caused by the environment in which they live.<br><br>
Although I was delighted with the speech made by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Queen's Park that the environment of the various areas is a matter of urgent priority. I look forward to my right hon. Friend taking action to try to solve some of these problems.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barry Henderson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to take up some of the points made by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. White). I should say at the outset that I welcome the Bill in general.<br><br>
It has a good deal to say about housing needs but relatively little comment to make about people and the total environment in which they live. I am concerned that there is little in the Bill to ensure that we shall not again and again commit the 'blunders involved in some past attempts to improve housing in Scotland. There have been too many vast estates built by Socialist authorities, and built with the best will and the best intentions in the world, but nobody wants to live in them.<br><br>
The great merit of the Bill is that it will provide opportunities to improve older properties in established communities. This is a better arrangement than knocking them all down and then building in their place vast new soulless estates. Some of the great estates built in the last thirty years still lack the basic amenities and community facilities. They lack colour, imagination and soul. They have been built as great filing cabinets for people, and in this day and age this is quite unacceptable.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Queen's Park (Mr. McElhone) may remember the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 44</span>
famous by-election by which he first entered the House, and I spent a great deal of time wandering round his constituency and even went up on the roofs. I was struck with the community feeling there, despite in many cases the deplorable housing conditions. From the top of those houses, in the centre of the Gorbals, I looked across to the then brand-new block of flats in Hutchesonstown and built by a world-famous architect, the recipient of many prizes for design. But do the people of the Gorbals want to live there? No. They do not. They refer to the area as "Alcatraz."<br><br>
On the question of the importance of the environment, we all know that many houses may be internally perfect, but derelict and dull surroundings will cause problems. Clydebank used to be in the old constituency of East Dunbartonshire and had a hard time during the war. A wonderful opportunity was provided at that time to build proper accommodation in that area. An attempt was made to build a brave new Socialist world at Clydebank. Any visitor can now see after many years what it looks like. Some of the streets are named after distinguished leaders of the Attlee Government. Many of them were fine men. I wonder how they would feel if they were to go to Clydebank today. I believe that they would hang their heads in shame, if they were to see the consequences of Socialist local authority planning in those areas. They are dreary, drab; and the environment is depressing. I could cite many examples of products of unimaginative Socialist housing policies. They stand out like old pit beams, and, like old slag heaps, they are desperately in need of reclamation.<br><br>
I regret the lack of any positive measures to ensure that housing action areas, which in themselves are highly desirable projects, will not fall into the same condition as other areas in the past. I should like to see some provision in the Bill to enable housing action areas to be developed to a much higher environmental standard.<br><br>
Another aspect which has not been brought out in the Bill is what kind of housing people in Scotland are seeking at the present time, where the problems lie in terms of the type and size of house and all the rest of it. We have heard about the paradox of empty houses on the one hand and long waiting lists on the other. Part of the problem lies in the environ-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0152">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 45</span>
mental problems to which I have referred, but some of the difficulty lies in the fact that the houses are not of the right type, the correct number of units, and so on. The question of the right sort of tenancy or whether owner occupation is the answer has not been dealt with.<br><br>
I should like to see it made mandatory for local authorities to conduct a proper survey of housing lists and housing requirements in their areas to ensure that more is done in this respect. I believe that such a survey would reveal a pressing need for many more houses for single persons and elderly couples. This is where there is a particularly grave shortage. A survey would also reveal that there is still a huge, and by no means satisfied, demand for owner-occupied houses, particularly at the lower end of the price bracket. I hope that the Secretary of State will resist any attempt to prevent certain local authorities and development corporations from allowing a sitting tenant to buy his own house, where he wishes to do so.<br><br>
I should like to turn to Clause 34, and I regret that its provisions do not cover the point I am about to make. I refer to the somewhat privileged position in property development occupied by the British Railways Board. In a large number of areas local authorities have had problems in undertaking the proper development of properties controlled by the board. In my constituency there has been a good deal of friction between local authorities on this matter, but I am happy to say that an agreed solution has been reached in that case. However, it would appear that British Rail is in a privileged position in its dealings with local authorities, and local authorities have little opportunity to see that properties owned by British Rail are used in the best interests of the community, including railway users.<br><br>
I am a little worried about the discretionary element in the Bill since this often constitutes a difficult problem. I hope that the Scottish Office will at least give clear guidance to local authorities in the exercise of their discretion. One of the problems with discretionary powers is that there can be substantial difference between one local authority and another in treatment of specific cases. One person becomes aggrieved because he feels that a man down the road has had his case handled quite differently by the same local authority.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 46</span>
I should like to turn to Clause 3(2)(<i>c</i>)(i) where the phrase " prescribed limit " is used relating to the limit of rateable value within the ambit of the Bill. May we be told what the Secretary of State has in mind when using the words "prescribed limit" in this context?<br><br>
The Secretary of State referred to Clause 43, which I regard as a very good provision. Does the clause cover items such as stone cleaning? When an area is being brought up to a certain standard the properties involved may well be a mixture of countil-tenanted properties and owner-occupied houses, and one hopes that the local authority will be enabled to give a service to all with mutual agreement.<br><br>
In regard to Clause 5(4)(<i>b</i>), would it not reduce the burden on the Scottish Office and provide considerably improved flexibility if a figure could be given below which local authorities need not refer a matter for approval to the Secretary of State? This would help to deal with a number of relatively minor cases and would lead to speedier action.<br><br>
I should like the Government to look again at the provisions of Clause 5(6). I may be a little unused to examining provisions in parliamentary legislation, but I regard that subsection as sheer gibberish. I hope that the object of the subsection will be made more specific.<br><br>
I wonder whether voluntary repayment provided for in that Clause 10 will have to be a complete repayment of the whole grant or whether provision will be made for stepping repayment over a period of time.<br><br>
I turn to Clause 45, which many of my hon. Friends and I believe is of no advantage at all to the Bill. The provision stands out as a sore thumb and has little to do with the question of improving the standard of housing in Scotland. In the context of the freezing of rents, I understand that in the nine months to 31st December this will result in expenditure of £5 million to meet what the Secretary of State will do to support local authorities in a rent freeze. One has only to think what one could have done with a figure of £5 million in improving the environment and to deal with other serious problems with which we have dealt this morning.<br><br>
Furthermore, in the context of the rent freeze, I should like to draw attention to Early Day Motion No. 112 on this topic which I tabled yesterday. Despite the rent freeze among certain sections of the com-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0153">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 47</span>
munity, there is to be a substantial increase in rent in the hope that there would be compensation through the introduction of higher supplementary benefits. I believe this to be a fundamental error, and I hope that the Government will change their mind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Gourlay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish at the outset to welcome the Bill as far as it goes, but I want to take this opportunity to say that I believe its provisions do not go far enough in dealing with the present housing problems in Scotland. This situation may well be due to the fact that the Labour Government have been in office for only a short time, and have not had long enough to prepare legislation to make any significant improvement in the Scottish housing situation. I should like to see much more emphasis in the Bill on the introduction of new subsidies to enable Scottish local authorities once again to renew the building of municipal houses on the scale done during the previous Labour Government.<br><br>
12.45 p.m.<br><br>
I welcome the improvements my right hon. Friend has announced. Nevertheless, I am somewhat critical of a recent decision made by his Department, namely, that my right hon. Friend's Department, despite pleas from myself and a number of other hon. Members and local authorities which had made application for improvement grants for their own houses and which had had tenders approved prior to June 1973, and which had asked for such houses which were not completed by June 1974 to qualify for improvement grants, should say that the extension that had been granted would apply only to private owners and that the local authorities would be penalised by not receiving the 75 per cent. grant for those houses completed after June of this year.<br><br>
I know of the argument that has been advanced that local authorities are better able to look after themselves in such circumstances. Nevertheless, some of my local authorities will suffer substantial financial losses as a result of the difficulties which the contractors have encountered during the last year because of shortages of materials, the three-day week, and other factors. Circumstances have arisen which have been completely out of the control of the local authorities. I must register my disappointment that there is to be such a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 48</span>
difference in treatment between the private individual and the local authorities.<br><br>
Clause 45 refers to the rent income subsidy, and it is clear that in certain circumstances, there will be a loss to the local authorities. I sincerely hope that the regulations under this clause will soon be published so that the amounts of compensation will become clear to the local authorities. I mention this matter because one of the authorities in my constituency met last night—I do not know the result of the meeting—with the intention of flouting the present legislation till it knows what the effect of the rent freeze will be. It was intending to raise its rents, in spite of the present legislation, in October. Naturally it could do so with a degree of impunity since no local Government elections will be held for three years. I ask my right hon. Friend to ensure that he gives the maximum possible compensation to local authorities and that he announces it in the shortest possible time.<br><br>
I noticed in the document which was issued only the other day, which gives the rent levels in Scotland, that in one authority the average standard rent has increased from about £76 in 1970 to £148 in 1973. That is a considerable increase in the average rents of the authorities' houses. It seems ludicrous that the previous administration forced local authorities to raise rents to such a degree that almost one-third of the tenants of municipal houses in Scotland had to apply for and to receive rent rebates. That justified the decision of this Government to effect a rent freeze almost immediately on taking office.<br><br>
What disturbs me even more is that when looking at the document to which I have referred I discovered that in the same authority the average rateable value for municipal houses is in the region of £99. That represents 157 per cent. of the gross annual value. What will happen to the municipal tenants at the next quinquennial review of valuation in Scotland? Those tenants will be confronted not only with high rents but with high rateable values. Of course, there is a corollary to increased rateable value in that there is always a certain depreciation in the rate poundage. Nevertheless, with inflationary trends and the additional expenditure that local authorities have to undertake there is inevitably an increase in rate poundage which will increase the burden on the tenant. The local authority tenant, as a result of the rent policy
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0154">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 49</span>
which has been pursued in past years, will thus face even larger burdens. I hope that the next Bill my right hon. Friend introduces will ensure that such impositions will not be placed on the tenants of municipal houses.<br><br>
We have in many towns in Scotland large areas where houses have started to be demolished to make way for redevelopment schemes. In these areas we have considerable difficulties with what is known as planning blight. That affects adversely the business interests of everyone in the area and can sometimes create difficulties in obtaining adequate compensation. It causes a great deal of misery and difficulty for those tenants who have been left in properties in such areas before they are rehoused. I hope that my right hon. Friend, when framing his next Bill, will consider that problem and make some attempt to diminish the period between the decision to give planning approval for a redevelopment area and the acquisition of the properties in the area and the rebuilding. We should try by every means possible to remove the terrible planning blight which descends upon such areas.<br><br>
I am confident that in the not too distant future we shall have a majority Labour Government who will enable my right hon. Friend to do much more for housing in Scotland and to place before the House a Bill which will not be the shadow of the legislation passed on to us from the last Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Younger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that I was not able to be present when the Secretary of State opened the debate. I apologised to him earlier this morning.<br><br>
I had hoped to say a few things about some details in the Bill and the improvement campaign itself. It does not seem that I shall have sufficient time to do so before this sitting is terminated. I shall confine myself to beginning by welcoming the Bill in general.<br><br>
I do not pretend that the contents of the Bill were entirely an astonishing surprise to me. However, I hope very much that it will enable the improvement campaign, which has been so very successful since first introduced some years go, to move into what should be a new and more carefully directed stage in the improvement of our older houses. I think that the general help which it will give to local authorities to operate a flexible measure of improvement in the older parts of our towns and cities will be an
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 50</span>
improvement on the old system, although that system served us well.<br><br>
The problems and difficulties about which hon. Members have been talking this morning regarding the termination date and the improvement situation generally is a reflection of the oversuccess of the campaign in many ways during the last three or four years. For that reason such matters as the termination date problem and the improvement situation should, in a sense, be welcomed.<br><br>
The rent freeze is inevitably a matter which we must discuss during our housing debates. I can well appreciate why the incoming Government decided that they must inroduce it. I can well appreciate that any party would find it in political terms highly satisfactory to introduce such a freeze. That must apply to those who belong to the Labour Party. I appreciate and understand their point of view.<br><br>
However, I ask Labour Members who give their attention to these matters to think quietly to themselves whether that sort of measure is of any real assistance to those who need help. I know that I cannot expect such a matter to be talked about publicly, but I thought that the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) made a most courageous speech about five or six months ago in Committee in the last Parliament. He then said very much what I am attempting to say now. He said that there is little sense—if I may paraphrase his remarks—in a blanket, nonspecific subsidy for all rents if we wish to have more resources and more money available for the improvement of housing conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Lambie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What about the farmers?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Younger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether our agricultural correspondent, the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Lambie) will give us a talk about farming. I know that the farmers of Ayrshire would very much like to hear his views.<br><br>
The vital matter to understand is that under the present legislation there is no one on social security, no one with a low income, no one with a family and small means, no low-wage earner, or anyone in any financial difficulty, on any criteria that we have established, who has to pay a rent he cannot afford. That is the effect of the rent rebate scheme. I was glad to hear the Minister of State say at Question

Time a week or two ago that he felt that the rent rebate scheme had an important part to play in housing policy. If we have achieved that, then we have achieved a great deal in the past few years.<br><br>
I ask Labour Members to think about the effect of the rent freeze. It gives a bonus payment of £26 a year to everyone, including those with the highest incomes. There is always talk about people in council houses who own Jaguars. That is laughed at, and rightly so. However, there are many people who are earning substantial wages in my constituency and many other constituencies—for example, £50, £55, £60, £70, £80. It is to be questioned whether it is our top housing priority to give £26 a year as a free bonus to those people. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Selby) has referred to the difficult conditions in his constituency where so many people live on low incomes. Is it the top priority of the present Government to give a bonus of £26 a year to everyone in council accommodation, including those earning high wages? Of course, it is not. The Government, by means of the subsidy to help ratepayers bear the burden, and to some extent the ratepayers themselves, are having to foot the extra bill.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 52</span>
We must try to accept the advice—perhaps it is an unusual thing for me to suggest—that was given to the Committee some months ago by the hon. Member for Fife, Central. It must be realised once for all that a comprehensive rent rebate scheme throughout Scotland has now taken out of the Scottish housing system any hardship through the paying of rent. If Labour hon. Members say that the scheme is not having that effect, then let us consider making improvements to the scheme to ensure that it does. If we can do that, we can put aside any hardship to any family in Scotland, and we can continue with the business of getting more money into housing and improving housing.<br><br>
I hope that we can address ourselves to that aim by putting the old problems of rents behind us and considering from now on that we can devote ourselves to Scotland's top priority, namely, the improvement of not only individual houses but whole sections of our towns and cities which in their time have become totally out of date—</span></p>
