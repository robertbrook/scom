	<div class='page-header'><h1>HOUSING (SCOTLAND) BILL</h1></div>
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed</i> [	<i>14th May</i>],
	<br><blockquote><p>"That the Chairman do report to the House that the Committee have considered the Housing (Scotland) Bill in relation to the principle of the Bill.—[	<i>Mr. William Ross.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we were interrupted at the last sitting I was complaining that the extra money which the Government have produced and which local authorities are to be required to produce for the rent freeze was being concentrated upon people with higher incomes and was being paid only to a small extent to those with lower incomes, and I was suggesting various ways by which this could be put right, particularly by raising the needs allowance. As I said, I welcome the Government's proposals for housing action areas and the improvements which the Government have been able to make in the Bill. Small though they are, they are quite important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our debate last Tuesday the hon. Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles (Mr. Steel) referred to various discussions I had had with local authorities, particularly with Galashiels. Galashiels has a particularly difficult problem with older homes which are widely spread and in small parcels all over the town. I ask the Minister of State to spell out a little more how flexible the action area procedure will be in that sort of situation. When I visited Galashiels I assured the town council that the Conservative Government's intention was that housing action areas could, if necessary, be very small, just as they could be very large. If there are any towns which like Galashiels, have old homes which need attention, possibly on one side of a street or in part of a street, will the Minister assure us that it will be possible for local authorities to declare even such small areas to be housing action areas if they satisfy the Secretary of State that the criteria are fulfilled?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>56</span>
It happens, through nobody's fault, that the circumstances today are as unfavourable as they may be for some time for carrying out a dramatic drive on the remaining unfit areas. The higher rate of grant generally is being discontinued and the money is being concentrated only on action areas. The old local authorities in their last year of life are unlikely to make a major drive on the problem. Nor is it likely that the new local authorities in their preparatory year will find the time and energy to plan ahead a programme for older houses which are falling into decay. The Scottish Office should, therefore, put its finger firmly on the problem during the next 12 to 18 months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would the Minister of State consider it a good idea to set up within the Scottish Office a monitoring unit with sole responsibility for keeping under monthly scrutiny local authorities' plans for dealing with the remaining unfit houses? I know that the Scottish Office does its best to check up, but inevitably, unless a small unit within the Scottish Office has sole responsibility for keeping local authorities under continual pressure, in two or three years' time we shall come back again to the problem which has been with us for the last 50 years. I hope that the Minister of State will consider that suggestion, as I am sure that it would be helpful to him, to the Committee and to Scottish Members of Parliament to feel that firm pressure was being exerted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While we worry about older houses which have fallen into disrepair, through nobody's fault there is a danger of many of our comparatively new houses, perhaps no more than 10 years old, becoming substandard unless something is done about them. The only way to prevent these houses from falling into decay and becoming beyond repair is to raise the priority given by local authorities and all of us to housing management generally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I was at the Scottish Office we appointed a part-time adviser on housing management. I hope that that will be a useful appointment, and I wish the adviser and all who are associated with him every success. Housing management generally has not had a high enough priority in the past. I pay tribute to housing managers generally. Not only do they carry an extremely difficult burden, often with little thanks, but local authorities expect them to carry out improvements without giving
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0160">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>57</span>
them adequate resources to do so. In general, our housing managers do a magnificent job and deserve a great deal more help and support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Housing management has two functions. First, it tries to ensure that our existing stock of perfectly adequate housing is used to its best advantage and kept in decent repair. Secondly, it tries to ensure that the customer—the council house tenant—gets from the housing service what he is entitled to receive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those functions we have not given the housing management enough priority or resources. Often, the housing management office is one of the less well equipped offices of the local authority and has inadequate staff. The equipment with which it has to work is often not of the most modern type. I suggest that the Minister of State might consider sending out a circular to local authorities urging them to review the resources that are given to their housing management departments to see whether they can be upgraded or improved. The inadequacy of resources can best be seen in the way that the housing manager and his staff have to deal with the flood of daily complaints, problems, demands and requests made to them by the people who are on the housing waiting list. It is here that our thinking has fallen behind the desires and needs of the people during the last 10 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rising standard of living of the vast majority of Scottish people has led them to expect, demand and require a higher standard of living accommodation and surroundings than we have been planning to give them. It is no longer any use for the housing department just to provide any old council houses for Scottish families. It is no longer any use expecting people to accept blindly what they are allocated by an over-pressed and hardworking housing management department. People, rightly, are much more choosy. They expect a council house to be in a good state or repair and they want to enjoy the comfortable surroundings they see their neighbours enjoying, as they are encouraged to do by mass advertising. That is wholly to be welcomed. We must provide adequate resources for council houses in Scotland, because half the population are living in them. We must provide for the people who live in council
	<span class='label label-info column'>58</span>
houses the sort of accommodation they require.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will give two examples of what I mean. A case was brought to me recently of a gentleman who was a joiner by trade and obviously a competent one. He is not in my constituency, but his case was brought to my attention. He and his wife decided that they would like to make one corner of the kitchen in their council house into a dining area with built-in bench seating. They did this and made a nice job of it. Nobody would deny that the alteration immeasurably improved the appearance of the kitchen and the use of it. Yet, when that man moved out of the house to another area, the local authority insisted on the removal of that installation which the tenant had put in so skilfully, and, what is more, he was required to pay for the cost of the removal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Lambie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Name the authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was an authority south of the Border. I will not name it, but it is a genuine case. I think I have the support of most members of the Committee in saying that we must try to arrange for that not to happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second example concerns families who have become split. It is wholly unacceptable that most housing letting rules regard a split family—that is to say, where the husband and wife have separated but are not divorced or are not legally separated—as being one family. That can lead to a most undesirable situation. I have knowledge of a case which is typical of many. A husband and wife with three children separated. The wife had to find somewhere else to live. leaving the husband in the former matrimonial home, a council house. Some months later it came to the wife's notice that the husband was planning to exchange that council house for another in another area. There appears to be no way of preventing him from doing that. The result is that someone from a completely different area will move into what had been the matrimonial home of the family, leaving the wife and children to find other, perhaps sub-tenant, accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that there are pressures which make it difficult to make special cases, but we must devote ourselves, with much more care and resources, to trying to get
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0161">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>59</span>
better arrangements for housing management and to giving housing managers better resources to make such nonsense as I have described more the exception than it is at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Doig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentle- man mean to reverse previous Tory view that more freedom should be granted to the local authorities to run their own affairs?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is stretching what I am saying and is misunderstanding me very badly. He thinks that I am saying this in order to criticise local authorities, but I have taken the greatest care to make it clear that I think it is a matter for which we must share responsibility, just the same as those in local government must take responsibility for it as well. I do not want anyone to take what I am saying as a general or particular criticism of what local authorities are trying to do at present. I am drawing attention to the real problem of the system that is being operated. It is up to us to do our best to try to improve the management of our housing. I in no way wish what I have said to be regarded as a destructive criticism. It is not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This brings me to the matter of eviction. I have always been as close as one can get to being a complete opponent of eviction, although I recognise that in the last resort it sometimes has to happen. However, eviction always creates more problems than it solves and I would like the Minister of State to tell us about the studies which the Scottish Housing Advisory Committee is undertaking on eviction. These studies have been going on for some months. How are they proceeding? I wonder when we can expect some reports from the advisory committee. I have the greatest admiration for the committee because it has done a great deal of helpful work in housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I turn to the problem of Glasgow which has already been mentioned in our debate. Glasgow is the main housing problem area in Scotland and will undoubtedly remain so for some time. Here again, I make no criticism at this stage of previous efforts to solve Glasgow's massive housing problems. Almost every action taken through the years has been with the best of intentions and in the circumstances of the time was probably the right action. There is nothing
	<span class='label label-info column'>60</span>
to be gained by blaming anyone over Glasgow's great housing problems. However, I hope that the Minister of State will do all in his power to bring home to Glasgow Corporation and the new Glasgow District Authority the need for the acceptance of the sort of ideas which were put forward in th report on the areas of need, brought out a couple of years go. I did not agree with everything in the report but it was an effective and useful attempt to draw attention to he present problems of planning in Glasgow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no doubt that the only hope of putting right Glasgow's longstanding housing problems lies in accepting that we need a dramatic raising of planning standards throughout the city, so that the coming generation of houses will be right up to date when built, instead of being out of date by the time they are built. This requires a real effort by the Government and the new local authority to try to ensure that houses are built in such a way that, if anything, they are in advance of their time, not behind it. This means a complete review of planning standards throughout the city and I hope that the Government press the new local authority on this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister of State will go further and refuse absolutely to accept any requests for approvals for houses, whatever the pressures, unless the houses are to be built to the new, latest planning standards. This may be difficult for the Minister of State but from my position on the back benches I would certainly support him if he were to refuse any further approvals unless the proposals were clearly to be within the new planning standards. Perhaps it would be a help to him to get some support from these back benches.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank McElhone</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for what the hon. Gentleman said about Glasgow and its difficulties, especially those relating to housing. Does he not agree that if we are to update planning procedures one of the first requisites must be to get rid of the indicative cost procedure, or at least to alter a great deal of the criteria of the present indicative cost procedure, and so prevent a repetition of the barrack-type buildings which have gone up in the past because of financial pressure from the Scottish Office?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0162">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>61</span>
Gentleman, because I was going to refer to indicative cost procedure, not for quite the same reason which he gave, although I go a long way with him in that. I would not accept that indicative cost procedure is the main reason that planning standards have not been effective. It is a reason, but not the main reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that the Minister of State and his right hon. Friend have not indulged in setting any general targets for the number of houses which they intend to build in the whole of Scotland. I hope that no pressure will be put on the Minister of State to set such targets, because they make no sense. What is needed in Scotland is not a broad figure of council houses to be built all over Scotland but figures for substantial numbers to be built in particular areas. We do not want 	<i>x</i> thousand in Scotland as a whole. We want a large number—I do not know exactly how many offhand—in areas of particular need. Glasgow is one of those areas. I hope that the Minister of State will feel free to build many council houses in areas where there is need and that he will not feel bound to produce an overall target which does not mean a thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regarding indicative cost, should not the Government consider whether this is any longer relevant in the light of the new system of housing finance? I can see how in the past there was a good argument for saying that central Government must approve all the details but now the new system of housing finance means that the local authority has an absolute, direct and full interest, as do the ratepayers, in the cost of new houses to be built, and housing costs will be put on the housing revenue account. There is a built-in safeguard to stop local authorities from being wasteful in spending money. Every extra pound spent will fall to a considerable extent on the local authority's housing revenue account. The indicative cost system should be eased and modified. It has served a purpose in the past, but the amount of bureaucracy, detailed consideration, and interference with details of local authorities' building plans which it involves, is probably not worth what the system now achieves. Local authorities have to be economically minded in what they spend on housebuilding. The time has come when we must consider what is to happen to the indicative cost procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>62</span>
I am sorry that I have taken rather longer than I intended to take in raising these points, but I hope that the Committee will give full backing to the Government in taking action to get new houses in Scotland and to prevent existing houses from becoming unfit in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin F. Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for not being present at the previous sitting of the Committee because on my duties in connection with the Channel Tunnel hitherto which I may have to disappear again, but I have read the Official Report of the debate. It seemed to be noncontroversial, and, by my arithmetic, there were 12 speakers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to introduce a note of disharmony but my feelings about the Bill are rather more ambivalent than those expressed by any speaker last week. I welcome some of the points in the Bill, particularly the changes introduced since the Bill was last before the House. I am, for instance, pleased about the increase in tolerable standard to include the specification of a bath. A year ago I visited the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) to try to press this change on him and I am glad that the present administration took this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was a reference in the Committee last week to 45,000 houses in Glasgow. I wish to put on record that there are also 20,000 houses in Edinburgh which will be affected by the proposals, and over half of those houses are in my constituency. I am sure that the electors there will be grateful to the Government for bringing them within the scope of the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Substantially the Bill is the same Bill as that presented to the last Parliament by the previous administration and I like it as little now as I did then. I was Chairman of the Housing Committee in Edinburgh before my election here. We tried in the past two years seriously to change the slum clearance programme from one of demolition towards one of rehabilitation and we tried to carry out the spirit of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1969, but we have found it difficult to carry out the spirit of the Act within the letter of the law and there is little in the Bill to help overcome our problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the necessity to be brief and I shall, therefore, raise only one major problem, although it is a key
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0163">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>63</span>
problem, concerning ownership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The typical Scottish slum is a small one, usually a single end, one room and a kitchen. It is possible to instal a bathroom but only at the cost of reducing space so much that the work is of little or no use. The typical Scottish slum is also to be found in a tenement, which will require serious structural repair if its stability is to be guaranteed for the next 20 years. If the tenement is in a major conurbation it is almost certain that it will be in a square and probably the most deplorable feature is the environment of the back area. Radical treatment is needed if these houses are to get a life of 20 years, and this treatment can be carried out only of there is common ownership. The work cannot be done under the present multi-ownership, with perhaps half a dozen occupiers and a couple of undercaptitalised owners. In advocating common ownership I do not necessarily say that the owner has to be the local authority, but certainly common ownership is required, whether through a housing association or residents' co-operative, yet there is nothing in the Bill to help on this. We are in danger of following a procedure largely developed in the English situation in which the standard slum in a terrace can be treated individually but that is not sufficient for the problems we face in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that I may be told about the effect of compulsory purchase orders, but it can take at least 18 months to get a compulsory purchase order because in any area of any size which may be involved there are always at least one or two owner-occupiers, a public inquiry is needed, and this takes time. I appreciate that any legislation must try to strike a balance between the rights of the individual and what is the most expeditious way of proceeding, but I cannot see the proposed procedure as safeguarding the rights of the individual in any way. It is questionable whether there was a single case in the past two years in which we sought compulsory purchase and failed to get a slum clearance order. The present procedure does not safeguard the rights of the owner; nor does it help us to tackle the problems. From the first approval of a draft resolution for a housing action area till confirmation of a compulsory purchase order there will be three years. That is a major delay and we must look
	<span class='label label-info column'>64</span>
for improvement in procedure so that action can be taken more quickly to treat slums.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A wide range of minor points also concern me. I am, for instance, concerned that improvement grants will still go only to owners. If the landlord fails to take advantage of an improvement grant the grant should be available to the tenant if he is prepared to carry out the work. I am also deeply disquieted by the proposals to remove security of tenure from tenants in housing action areas. This contrasts sharply with all the rights provided for owner-occupiers. I hope to be able to press home successfully these minor Committee points by twisting the arms of the usual channels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much more, I am concerned about the major issue of points which have been left out of the Bill. Out of 50 Clauses in the Bill 43 relate to new houses, specifically to houses with defective plumbing arrangements. I have spent a good deal of the last three years trying to persuade people living in the most appalling slum conditions to move to council houses on a distant estate where they would have all five standard plumbing amenities. I found it often very difficult to pursuade them to move. Our preoccupation with bathrooms and running hot water is not a preoccupation that is shared by the electorate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to underestimate the problems of a large number of people who live in the slums of our city centres, but it is time that we recognised, as a matter of fact, that there are now more slums in large council estates in our major conurbations, and there are serious problems which desperately require attention, such as lack of community development, the absence of amenities and quite deplorable environments. Nothing in the Bill helps that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is time, too, that we paid attention to the problems of housing management, to which the hon. Member for Ayr referred. It is in him a bit of an effrontery to criticise the Bill for what is not in it because it is, more or less, his Bill. We have reached a situation in which our major authorities are very powerful and important landlords. If Parliament can presume to set down a national minimum standard for rent rebate schemes it ought
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0164">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>65</span>
to look at something such as a national minimum standard for house letting requirements. That is a very pertinent point as we move into an age in which local authorities are the monopoly suppliers of rented accommodation. The Bill is silent on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I welcome the appointment made by the previous Government of one part-time adviser in housing management I must say that that contrasts pretty feebly with the three-figure number of architects, surveyors and engineers also employed by the Department to look after the physical problems. We ought to shift the balance much more to the question of management policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the Bill is the first of three courses of housing legislation that we are to have from the Government. I am prepared to swallow the present Bill as a rather unsatisfying and unfilling hors d'oeuvre. I hope, however, that when we come to the main course in the autumn—a Bill prepared by the present Government—we shall be presented with a rather more satisfying and filling menu.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the remarks of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Cook) based on his definitive experience as Chairman of the Housing Committee in Edinburgh. I am slightly more enthusiastic than he about the Bill. I welcome it very much as what could be called a bipartisan triumph for rehabilitation in housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was by no means a foregone conclusion that rehabilitation would receive the wide acceptance in the House and outside it as there might seem now. For many years there have been wide reservations about the whole concept of rehabilitation, stretching from those at one end of the spectrum maintaining that it was an insignificant and irrelevant means of dealing with housing problems to those at the other end who maintained that it was intended to perpetuate slum conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to consider why there has been such a major change of public opinion. Clearly, one of the main reasons is the failure of successive Governments to provide a sufficient quantity of new housing to deal with our housing needs, but that in itself is not a sufficient explanation. Clearly, a major factor must

be the gradual realisation that housing and, more important, the social conditions of our community are simply not being met by the large, sprawling new housing estates being formed on the outer extremities of our cities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Edinburgh, and elsewhere throughout the country, major new housing has been provided for many thousands of people, but we find that the social problems which we had hoped would be removed with the ending of slum conditions are still present on these housing estates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my constituency I have the largest housing estate in Edinburgh, Wester Hailes, with some 15,000 people. We find that, despite the magnificent geographical position of that estate and despite what I believe to be the fine architecture of much of the building on the estate, nevertheless, social problems have been re-created. To use Winston Churchill's remark, we find that men shape houses but thereafter the houses tend to shape men.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Western Hailes, as on many estates, the social problems characteristic of the central areas of our cities are being repeated. In Western Hailes there is a dramatic lack of social provision. Despite the thousands of people living there, there is no community centre. Although there are two primary schools, there is no secondary school, nor will there be one for several years to come. Until recently there was no shopping centre for these many thousands of people. There is still no post office, although I understand that the Post Office is to provide a sub-office—for the use of between 10,000 and 15,000 people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not surprising that, with such a total lack of amenity in our new housing estates, people are determined to continue living in the city centres. I pay credit and give unqualified congratulations to the voluntary associations on the new housing estates which are battling against tremendous odds to provide amenities which local and public authorities have not provided. However, their work is not enough. Apart from any lack of provision in our major suburban council estates, what we have seen in recent years is a pattern of desire on the part of people living in city centres to continue living there irrespectively of the quality of their houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0165">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>67</span>
I am sure that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central and others who have knowledge of the problems of central areas of our cities are well aware that many people have volunteered to double or treble their rents for their existing houses rather than be obliged to remove many miles out to the periphery of their cities. The reason relates both to the community to which they are used and in which they have been brought up and to how they view life in other parts of the city.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest to the Minister of State that one factor which we should seriously consider in any policy of rehabilitation is enabling those whose houses are being improved to suffer the minimum inconvenience during that rehabilitation. I suggest for the Minister's consideration an experiment which was carried out in Dundee by the local authority in a stair which contained eight houses. The authority acquired one house which became vacant. As each of the other houses was being rehabilitated the people who lived in them moved to the other house within that stair. This meant the minimum of dislocation, and people remained in the community to which they were used while the improvements were being made. They did not have the fear that once they had moved out of their houses they would not be allowed to return.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we need is a consideration of the real fears of many people who live in the older properties in the city centres. To a large extent the problems of the city centres are problems of ageing communities. People are terrified of major changes being made to their environment and housing conditions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman agree that the lesson which all Government's ought to learn is that it is folly to put a time limit on repairs because once this is done local authorities have to bunch up the jobs that they have to undertake and there is the resoluting agony of which we are all only too well aware?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I could not agree more. He is absolutely right. Clearly, if one imposes any restriction in circumstances over which one has no direct control it is inevitable that one will see a sense of
	<span class='label label-info column'>68</span>
injustice and chaos in the administration of housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I have one criticism of the Bill it is that it does not encompass the totality of the problem. Housing cannot be encapsulated. It cannot be treated as a single unit having no connection with other problems of the community. What we are facing, when considering older housing stock, is a crisis of the cities themselves. We are finding that this applies particularly to Scotland. The centres of our cities are in grave danger of becoming derelict in years to come. Looking, for example, at the Central Lowlands we find in Edinburgh and Glasgow—this is the tale of two cities—that although the problems are very much greater in Glasgow essentially there are exactly the same fears.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Edinburgh over the last 20 years the population of the central area has decreased by fully one-third. This process is continuing, with housing demolition to make way for office development, various other developments and new roads. I pay tribute to what I call the C.6 lethargy of Edinburgh City Council. Some years ago there was an apalling scheme to solve Edinburgh's transport problems by the construction of major motorways ringing the central area of the city. This, among other things, involved the demolition of a large amount of property. Due to the lethargy of the corporation, by the time that had reached the stage where a decision might have been forthcoming, the whole project of inner urban motorways had become unfashionable, and the idea was sent to the pigeonhole whence it came and ought not to have emerged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Clark Hutchinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have not finished with this problem of the roads. My hon. Friend would do well to keep a strict eye on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. He is correct that the problem is a continuing problem. What I want to stress is that we have in Edinburgh at least removed the threat of major urban motorways within the centre of the city and the problem has become more a suburban problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that in considering the future of housing in Edinburgh and elsewhere we should be trying gradually to formulate a new policy towards our cities as a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0166">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>69</span>
whole. To use a fashionable word, we should be thinking in terms of "devolution" within our cities. To a large extent we are still constricted by the nineteenth century view that a city is something with a centre which is in the middle, around which office development, and so on, must be concenrated, with a surrounding peripheral area of housing, in which people who visit and work in the centre must be allowed to live. Clearly, any major urban development will continue to require a centre. That centre should be what one would call 	<i>primus inter pares</i>. It should not have an exclusive concentration within it of the needs of large cities. Rather we should be thinking in terms of developing offices and commercial development to many of the suburban centres. This would have a major impact on housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The greatest threat to housing in the central areas is commercial and office development, and road developments which presently threaten. Unless we keep living centres in Edinburgh, Glasgow and other urban areas of Scotland there is no doubt that the cities will become much less attractive places, with greater and greater social problems in the years to come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer, finally, to a point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Ancram) in the debate last week. He referred to the problems caused when the local authority decides to deal with certain property as being unfit for human habitation and when, despite this, unscrupulous landlords allow that property to be occupied for various periods.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make no apology for referring to the particular problem we have faced in Edinburgh over the last couple of years. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central will be equally concerned about this matter. We have a Mr. Dorward, who, curiously enough, is himself a council tenant. despite owning some 200 houses which have been let, in slum conditions, over many months. Mr. Dorward has made several appearances in court for allowing persons to occupy his property, despite the local authority wishing to take action to prevent people from living in those houses because of their condition. On each of these occasions Mr. Dorward was fined the maximum penalty. He made it
	<span class='label label-info column'>70</span>
clear on emerging from the court, according to Press reports, that he believed that he was carrying out a social need and acting for the benefit of his tenants. He implied that he would continue to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly that is not only an abuse of the law and something which brings discredit on our legal system; it also brings ridicule and discredit on the whole housing operation of our great cities when individual landlords of this kind, who are a small minority, can nevertheless act in such an unscrupulous fashion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that in this or a future Bill measures will be brought forward to enable this abuse to be brought to an end. The most obvious way would be greatly to increase penalties when this type of abuse takes place. If the penalty were to be greatly increased for a repetition of the same offence in a short period the abuse would become unknown. I make no apology for referring to this matter, because in Edinburgh and other cities it has been a blot on the administration and solution of housing problems for far too long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Bill. I realise that it will not by itself solve our housing problems, but I see it as the precursor to a more comprehensive approach by all Governments not simply to housing problems, but to the future of our great urban areas. Without such a comprehensive approach we shall build up similar, if not greater, problems in the years to come.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lambie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to follow the line taken by my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Cook) in making some criticism about the Government putting forward what is mainly a Tory Government Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We fought the election on the ground that we would repeal certain Acts brought in by the Conservative Government. One of those Acts was the Housing (Financial Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1972. I should have liked to have been taking part today in the initial stages of a new Bill to repeal that Act rather than wasting time on this Bill which everyone has said touches only the periphery of the housing problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) should have a guilty conscience in coming to the Committee and speaking about housing in Scotland. My
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0167">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>71</span>
hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Central made a pertinent point. He was the Convener of the Housing Committee in Edinburgh which, according to my information, built only 70 houses last year—only 70 houses in the second largest city in Scotland. That was not because my hon. Friend was Convener of the Housing Committee, but because it had to proceed under a Tory Government Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ayr spent most of his time trying to justify what the last Government had done. We all know what they did. They created a record for the lowest building programme in the United Kingdom in this century. They created land prices without precedent. Under their adminstration interest rates went up from about 7 per cent. to 11 per cent. with the possibility, but for the action taken by this Government, of rising to 13 per cent. and 14 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The previous Government spent their time attacking not only council tenants but their own supporters, the owner-occupiers, by making it almost impossible for owner-occupiers and would-be council tenants to get houses. No wonder the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor), in a television programme previewing the Tory Party Conference in Ayr, said that he was now in control as chairman of a committee, because the previous Government had made many mistakes in their housing policy. In making that statement the hon. Gentleman criticised his hon. Friend the Member for Ayr because he was in control of the Conservative Government's housing programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask my right hon. and hon. Friends to take a close look at the situation and to bear in mind what happened under previous minority Labour Governments. We had a minority Labour Government in 1924. Anyone who has studied or had any connection with the 1924 minority Labour Government will know that we still talk about the John Wheatley Housing Act. We still look at the areas where large numbers of houses were built, because they are now bringing in revenue to the housing finance of each town concerned. In 1929 and 1930 we had a minority Labour Government. However, we look back with pride on Tom Johnston's Act on slum clearance; it revolutionised house building in Scotland. Again, every local authority that built
	<span class='label label-info column'>72</span>
substantial numbers of houses at that time is glad to use the finance that is now coming in as a result of that legislation to help balance its housing revenue account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask my right hon. and hon. Friends to look at the Bill, to take it away, and to come back and do what we are doing with the Bill to repeal the Industrial Relations Act—namely, to grasp the nettle and clearly state that, whether the Opposition vote against it or not, whether we are a minority Government or not, we will take steps to put right the fundamental financial problems facing local authorities and private builders in building houses in Scotland under the previous Tory Government's Acts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel quite strange when I look round and see the composition of this Committee. In Scotland 70 per cent of the people live in either public authority housing or private, tenanted property. However, it is doubtful whether more than 5 per cent. of hon. Members making up this Committee live in tenanted property. In fact, the overwhelming majority are owner-occupiers. Indeed, not one Member of the Scottish National Party, which I am always told is in the mainstream of Scottish tradition, is a tenant. They are all owner-occupiers and some have more than one house. Not one SNP member is a tenant. Therefore, we have a tendency to look at the problems facing 70 per cent. of people in Scotland in a completely detached way. Few hon. Members know what the problems are. They have escaped from them. I include both Front Benches in this respect. I think that we need to take a radical look at the housing situation and not just tinker with the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ayr laid great stress on the fact that the council tenant gets a subsidy of £5 million because the Labour Government have carried out an election promise to freeze rents, but what the hon. Gentleman did not tell us was that, looking at the overall financial provisions for housing, the owner-occupier gets a subsidy of about £400 million annually. The council tenant, on the United Kingdom basis, gets a subsidy of £200 million annually_ . so the owner-occupier gets double the subsidy given to the council tenant. The hon. Member for Ayr talked about the rich council tenant getting more than his fair share, but he did not tell us that the larger the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0168">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>73</span>
house that the rich owner-occupier buys the greater the subsidy that he gets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the passage of the last Housing Bill I obtained figures to substantiate my claim that most of the money provided for housing finance goes not to the council tenant but to the owner-occupier. To bring those figures up to date I got in touch with the Library and got more figures. In previous debates I had taken the average mortgage as about £4,000. The present average mortgage is £6,500. At 11 per cent. the repayments on a loan of that amount taken out for 25 years would be £772 per annum. Only the interest is eligible for tax relief. In the first year of the mortgage £650 of the total repayments would be in interest and the rest would be capital. The tax relief on £650, at 33 per cent., amounts to £214.50. I am a council tenant. The subsidy on my house is £24. If I get out of my council house and buy my own house on mortgage, instead of getting a Government subsidy of £24, I shall be getting a subsidy of £214.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will that provide more money for house building? It will merely create a greater problem, as people throughout the United Kingdom are finding. Not only that, but a person who takes out a life endowment policy as an insurance against his mortgage repayments can claim income tax relief on that policy. I calculate that on a £6,500 mortgage the amount of relief on the premiums for a life endowment policy would be about £58. That is providing a total Government subsidy of about £272 for a person buying his own house on an average mortgage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So much of what the hon. Gentleman has said has been so totally inaccurate that I have not bothered to intervene. In comparing his council house with a £24 subsidy, that house having been built many years ago. with a new owner-occupied house which has just been built and has a recent mortgage, is he not giving a completely misleading comparison? Will he compare his house with the mortgage on a house built at the same time?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lambie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can accept that point. However, my point is that whenever we talk about subsidising council tenants re must also bear in mind that people who went into houses under previous Housing
	<span class='label label-info column'>74</span>
Acts have not been subsidised because, with the increase in rents, they are now paying more than the Government subsidy. Tenants who live in council houses, especially those built pre-war, are subsidising the new council tenant more than the owner-occupier or the taxpayer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not true that the tenants of local authority houses built pre-war and now paying the standard rents will be subsidising all tenants of council houses built since 1950?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lambie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was the point that I was trying to make. My hon. Friend the Member for Paisley (Mr. Robertson) has substantiated it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us take another look at this matter. Let us not adopt the hypocritical attitude of hon. Gentlemen opposite, and sometimes that of some of my hon. Friends, who accept these high subsidies and do not seem to realise that the council tenant is subsidising the owner-occupier and other council tenants who are going into new houses, not the opposite, as the hon. Member for Ayr and his hon. Friends try to make out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my right hon. and hon. Friends on the Front Bench will put forward an argument justifying the council tenant, because in Scotland the council tenant is the Labour voter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The council house tenant is a Labour voter in just the same way as the owner-occupier in London and the South-East is the Tory voter. That is why Tory housing legislation always places an emphasis on the owner-occupier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, various changes have taken place. For example, owner-occupiers used to pay tax under Schedule A, but after a famous by-election when a Liberal captured a safe Tory seat in one of the owner-occupier belts in South-East England, the then Tory Government changed the income tax laws and abolished Schedule A. That was a legitimate tax which was levied by all Governments prior to 1958. It was a means of getting back some of the money that the owner-occupier received as the value of his house continued to increase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have often seen advice given in advertisements to buy a house. It is said to be the best bargain that a person can have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0169">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>75</span>
as the value of a house increases by 10 per cent. or 11 per cent. annually. Anyone who buys a house is in present circumstances on a financial bonanza. That applies whether a person invests money for his own housing or for somebody else's housing. Schedule A was a method used by the Treasury to get some of that money back. The owner-occupier is the only person who gets an added income every year and who pays no tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again I must thank the Library for providing me with certain calculations. The figure which I am about to quote relates to 1968–1969. It is the latest figure that I have. It was one of the figures that I put to the previous Government and argued on in Committee. Owner-occupiers are now making a tax saving, following the abolition of Schedule A, of approximately £275 million. The present figure must be nearly double that amount. No one ever talks about that. No one ever suggests that Schedule A should be restored. With the enormous increase in value of housing, surely the owner-occupier should not be the only person to escape taxation. A person who puts money into a bank has to pay tax on the interest he receives. Tax has to be paid on all the various other forms of investment. Why is the owner-occupier the only person who escapes taxation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In England and Wales the owner-occupier represents 55 per cent. of the population. If Tory Governments look after their friends and voters in England and Wales, why should not the Labour Party tailor its housing policies to look after its voters in Scotland? Why is it immoral for the Labour Party to look after council tenants when it is not immoral for the Tory Party to look after the owner-occupiers?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us get rid of all the hypocritical nonsense about subsidies and get down to the basic facts. First there is roughly an equal divide of council house tenants and owner-occupiers. By direct subsidy, income tax remission and the abolition of Schedule A the owner-occupier is receiving about £600 million annually compared with the £200 million the council house tenant receives. I hope that more people will stand up and be counted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The factor that is killing finance for building is that more and more money is going into private enterprise. Fewer
	<span class='label label-info column'>76</span>
houses are being built because the rich are receiving more than the poorer people in the council houses are receiving less.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman make a comparison between the amount of money paid out each week by the average council house tenant and by the average owner-occupier? Will he compare the typical Scottish council house tenant who pays £3 rent each week with the typical owner-occupier who may be paying £10 a week from the same amount of income?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lambie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is easy to deal with that. The council house tenant is paying rent. He is paying to occupy his house. The owner-occupier is paying a weekly amount to occupy his house and he has the value of the house. An owner-occupier enters into a form of compulsory saving. A council house tenant who entered a house in 1924, for example, has now paid for that house, but when he dies he will have no rights to the house in spite of the fact that he has paid for it. Such a tenant could not even say to the local authority "My sons and daughters should stay in the house." The sons and daughters would get the house by right only if the local authority said that they could stay in it. The hon. Member for Ayr knows that there are problems in Ayrshire. Ayr County Council operated a policy that meant that sons and daughters had no right to the house in which they lived. However, when an owner-occupier leaves a house or when he dies he leaves a capital asset.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) is not present as I shall use him as an example. The hon. Member for Ayr mentioned a speech made by my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central and I consider that he was unfair to my hon. Friend. Later, when I took part in a television broadcast with my hon. Friend. he put forward his own case. He had bought a house for under £10,000 which he was selling for £40,000. He had not improved the house in any way but because of increasing house values he stood to make roughly £30,000. I suppose that the house could have been provided for Prince Charles but unfortunately it was not big enough. Let us not compare things that are not alike.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0170">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

The council house tenant is getting the unfair part of the housing deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ayr laid great stress on the fact that although rents have gone up in the public sector the number of rent rebates has also increased. Let us, follow the logic of that case and put up the rents so high that everyone will receive a rent rebate. I suppose that that would solve all the problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Russell Fairgrieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the number of rebates has increased, that does not argue against the case that rebates and means tests are wrong. I should like to see the Government actively considering the present state of housing finance in Scotland along the lines that I have suggested, and not just tinkering with the problem by reintroducing a Tory Bill which at the end of the day will not build one more house. It will do nothing apart from tinkering with the periphery of the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I did not go along with all the arguments and conclusions of the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Lambie), it seems that he is more in accord with my own views than many other hon. Members. The hon. Member for Central Ayrshire complains that the Bill is a Tory Bill. That does not surprise me. The Tory Party and the Labour Party, after the election, reminded me of football players changing their shirts at the end of the match. The fact that a Tory Bill is presented by a Labour Government does not surprise me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not only is this measure a Tory Bill but it is an inadequate Bill. That applies
	<span class='label label-info column'>78</span>
whether it is bound by a blue or a pink ribbon. Of course, we all welcome the Bill as it is a small step forward. There is no doubt about that. I also welcome the fact that the Government have introduced a Scottish Bill that is separate from the English Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State for Scotland has referred to the aim of clearing the slums quickly. I have been reading about that all my life. We are now in 1974 and we are still trying to clear the slums in Scotland. The trouble is the same as ever—namely, cosmetics instead of sugery. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Queen's Park (Mr. McElhone) has defended Glasgow Corporation. I do not think that he can make much of a defence. The housing conditions in Glasgow are too well known to us all. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Queen's Park knows Glasgow better than I shall ever know it, but we all have eyes and friends and relatives in Glasgow. The conditions in some parts which still have to be cleaned up are appalling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They are not made better by the huge, sterile housing estates which lack all human amenities. Within such estates there is no sense of community. There are the multi-storey blocks which the corporation was conned into constructing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was sympathetic with the plea made by the hon. Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Doig) about certain houses which stand empty in Dundee. He told us that they contain no timber and that they are constructed entirely of concrete. Such a house is not fit for human habitation, such a house is a slum regardless of the soundness of the structure. The Government should assist Dundee Corporation to ensure that such houses are no longer regarded as fit for human habitation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Fairgrieve) has said that council house policy has reduced mobility of labour. I object to that viewpoint. Further, I object to Scottish workers being regarded as industrial Arabs. If a council house tenant has to find employment a long way from the house which he occupies as a council house tenant it is difficult for him to pull up his roots and to leave. He would have to join the list of another authority and wait for several years. It is unrealistic for the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West to talk in those terms.

improvement grant is to come to an end. I go along with those who ask for an extension. I note that the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) is pressing for an extension. It is a pitty that the Labour Party and the Tory Party do not show in Government the wisdom and compassion they can exhibit when in Opposition.

In the previous administration I made several attempts to have the improvement grant extended entirely without success.

In my constituency many individuals were unable to take up the grant because of the fundamental lack of facilities for piped water. Piped water, which existed during the Roman occupation of Britain, is still not available in many parts of my constituency. We know that with new technology and colour television we are bound to be at the end of the line, but we are still waiting for piped water which has been known about for thousands of years. Incidentally, I am grateful to the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) who gave me sympathetic aid in getting several schemes started. I support the suggestion made by the hon. Member for Ayr for the provision of more sheltered accommodation within these proposals.

Something should be done to reduce the rate of interest on housing loans. No doubt, to ask that housing loans should be interest free is asking for the moon, but a Labour Government should rid us of the usury which is associated with the rate of interest on housing loans. They should be fighting with passion to divert the money that is wasted on Concorde, on defence and on nuclear submarines. Some members of the Labour Party who opposed those things when they were in opposition forget them once they are in Government.

The hon. Member for Kirkcaldy (Mr. Gourlay) said that he hoped that in the not too distant future there would be a Labour Government to enable his right hon. Friend to do much more for housing in Scotland and to place before Parliament a Bill which would not be the shadow of legislation introduced by a Conservative Government. The Government should have the courage to put forward a Bill to deal with the housing problem in Scotland. If they did, my
	<span class='label label-info column'>80</span>
party would support them. I challenge them to bring in such a Bill. I doubt whether even the Conservatives would bring them down on it. If they were brought down they could go to the country with a good conscience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

My hon. Friend the Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Lambie) is a little unfair. He arranged to get me on the Saltcoats waiting list. He spoke of putting in a stove, a refrigerator and a washing machine. Unfortunately, although I have used all my powers of persuasion, I have been unable to move the Treasurer of Saltcoats to put my name on the housing list! It is remarkable that, while Saltcoats had the cheapest rents, it had the lowest housing burden prior to the coming into operation of the famous Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The general criticism of Labour councils in Scotland is not justified. It is just a general attack on what the Tories call second-class shiftless citizens and tenants. That is the way we still look at the problem. I hope that the Government are not beginning to adopt a Tory outlook.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In England the problem will be partly solved by the massive loan made to the building societies. To achieve an equivalent effect in Scotland we need local government housing subsidies. The number of people in Scotland, both in total and relatively, who can take up loans from building societies is very much less than it is in England and Wales. That
	<span class='label label-info column'>82</span>
is nothing to do with the individual or with what he thinks about renting or buying a house. It is the equation which building societies calculate before they will lend money that determines whether a man can get a loan for a house. A toolmaker in Coventry can get a loan, but a toolmaker in Motherwell cannot, because the relationship between his income and housing costs will not provide him with anything other than an old tenement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many young people have spent good money on useless old tenements and in trying to make them habitable. For many that is a method of getting a council house. The fly thing to do is to get to know which tenement is next due to be knocked down and to buy a house there. That is the price of getting a council house. We need more houses, but the Bill will not provide them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to housing action areas. I make no apology for mentioning Ferguslie Park where, from 1935 up to a year or two ago, 3,000 houses were built. Today, about 600 are lying empty and another 500 have been demolished. One has to be careful how one uses figures in relation to Ferguslie Park. Although there has been an official policy of demolition by the local authority many of the demolitions are done by persons unknown. One can never find out, because no one in Ferguslie Park sees anything, hears anything or knows anything. That is the only way the people there can exist. A deprived community of 10,000 persons still lives within Ferguslie Park, yet not one penny will come from the Bill to assist Ferguslie Park, Blackhill or any other notorious housing scheme in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that Ferguslie Park had more publicity last night—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lambie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In "Nationwide".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>—on the television programme "Nationwide". It is a nationwide problem. It does not matter whether one begins to tackle it in Liverpool, London or Ferguslie Park, it has to be tackled, and it cannot be tackled by fair words or pious hopes. There is only one way to tackle it and that is with money. It has long been obvious that Governments are not prepared to provide local authorities with the wherewithal to clear up these modern slums.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Teddy Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman, who knows Ferguslie Park so well, give us an idea what is wrong with the houses or with the amenities? Is it the structure of the houses, the amenities provided, or something else?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not the structure of the houses, except that in 1935 far too many were built in far too small an area. It is true that the amenities were nil. It is also true that some of the demolitions are being done in an effort to provide an open space. The trouble is a modern phenomenon which has arisen during the last 10 years. When council house buildings which are perfectly good houses with toilets, hot and cold water and reasonable amenities inside are bit by bit being demolished by vandals, and there is apparently no way of stopping it, it is time for central Government to move in. The cost of replacing the Ferguslie Park houses being demolished by amateurs would run into many millions of pounds. The houses have only one fault, which is that they were built too early on a bad plan. There is nothing basically wrong within the houses. Houses of the same design and built in the same period in other towns are still providing good accommodation.

I come to housing management policy. An error was made in the late 1930s and 1940s that no council and no housing manager has been able to overcome. Once a ghetto is created it is exceedingly difficult to get rid of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>84</span>
to go on about Ferguslie Park, but it would be worth while for the Committee to see Ferguslie Park and listen to the people there for two and a half hours—indeed it would be one of the best things the Committee could do—rather than spend two and a half hours dealing with this useless Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not all the housing problems are in houses built in the last century. There are modern slums which are also in need of attention, and unless some action is taken these housing problems will remain with us for many years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Buchanan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Any Bill which seeks to improve our housing stock is welcome. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind) has talked about the new housing policies and my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley (Mr. Robertson) criticised the policies of various Governments. The hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Stewart) talked about the conditions in Glasgow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is one improvement in housing policy which I welcome very much it is the decision of any Government to seek to improve and maintain the existing housing stock. One reason we are in such a state today is that up to 10 years ago there had been no attempt at all to improve, maintain or preserve the then existing housing stock. My hon. Friend the Member for Paisley spoke about complaints relating to Blackhill and Ferguslie Park. I could refer to similar complaints regarding most of the peripheral areas in Glasgow. When we tried to knock down property and rebuild the areas we stretched the building forces to the limit. We could not afford to provide the proper amenities in the housing schemes and so we now have the concrete jungle which we speak about. If an attempt had been made at that time to do what is proposed in the Bill—which is only a start—we would not be in the present difficult situation. Glasgow has no housing policy —it has broken down. For instance, 200 or 300 houses have to be kept empty. Why? In case a tenement falls down. The whole of the middle range of tenemental property comes into the housing action areas. What happens if we knock down all the slums? Where do we find new houses for the people? Where are the sites? It is not an easy job finding new sites for new homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0174">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>85</span>
I welcome the Bill. The hon. Member for the Western Isles says it is the first step. However, if it were possible for my hon. Friend the Minister of State to wave a magic wand so that all the financial help needed were available would we make much more progress than we are now? There are other vital elements to consider, such as men and resources and even Glasgow's latest housing programme is experiencing a shortage of essential material. Where are the skills to come from? From where will we get bricklayers, joiners, carpenters, plumbers and slaters? There is probably a task here for the trade unions. If we are to stimulate the conscience of building trade workers much more effort will be needed than hitherto. If we want to get the housing we are asking for there will have to be a massive retraining and apprentice programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is a piece of first aid and is a drive to keep standing those houses which may be good houses. The organisation within the building industry leaves much to be desired. In a time of slump brick kilns go out of commission, but when things are busy again there are not enough bricklayers or enough bricks. I would like to see carried out as speedily as possible a promise which our party made throughout the General Election campaign—the diversion of men, materials and resources from speculative and luxury building to the building and repairing of houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For Glasgow it is inevitably the case that any aid for housing is too little and too late. I do not say that in any spirit of carping criticism. It merely reflects the extent of Glasgow's problems. For instance, in my constituency we had in 1966 a plan approved for the Springburn area. Under this plan Gourlay Street was designated as an area worth preserving and it was proposed that three houses be made into two and bathrooms provided, as well as new roofs, and other things, so as to give people amenities. This was in the plan, but the planning procedures took too long and, due to lack of repairs, the buildings deteriorated rapidly. Admittedly, the condition of the buildings was accentuated by storm damage in, I think, 1967, but hundreds of houses which could have been saved are now being demolished. The area is dere-
	<span class='label label-info column'>86</span>
lict and dilapidated. The heart has been torn out of my constituency. Many hundreds of these houses could have been saved if a Bill such as this had been passed 10 or 15 years ago. It is now too late to do anything about the Spring-burn plan and the Gourlay Street area, but I hope that the Bill will be passed in time for a large amount of good to be done elsewhere in my constituency, particularly in Dennistown.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many parts of Glasgow, and Scotland in general, in which demolition is taking place but the tenants, and the citizens of the cities, towns and villages have no idea what is going on. I have raised this point on a number of occasions. Surely it is not asking too much for notices to be erected indicating to the people that houses are to be demolished to enable more houses, or perhaps a school or a road, to be built? This simple exercise in public relations would save quite a few complaints being made at the surgeries of Members of Parliament and members of local councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To get back to the Bill, few people would deny the generosity of the 90 per cent. grant in housing action areas, but there is one snag. Far too many of my constituents cannot afford to pay the remaining 10 per cent. It would be impossible for widows and old-age pensioners to do so. I would like to see a variable grant, up to 100 per cent. It is surely sensible in any means-tested grant to relate the extent of the applicant's liability to his means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to repairs, I would be happier if grants were not confined to housing action areas. I would like to see these grants paid right across the board. To take another example in my constituency, a tenement at No. 4 Ayr Street was rendered unsafe. Despite complaints made over five years about burst pipes and leaking roofs the landlord did nothing. Close by is No. 10 Ayr Street, a good building, which has been well looked after. No. 4 had been rendered unsafe, and when work started to demolish it No. 10 became unsafe, and so the domino demolition effect began. If proper repairs had been carried out earlier to No. 4 a survey would probably have been undertaken, with the aid of a grant, and more houses could have been saved. Many of my constituents who have bought houses at No. 10 Ayr Street would have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0175">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>87</span>
had the benefit of homes in which they could now reside, whereas they are now having to move out, without any payment for loss of home or disturbance, or any other compensation. This is manifestly unjust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The maximum improvement grant of £2,400 is somewhat inadequate and I hope that it can be increased. Do the maximum figure of £2,400, as proposed in Clause 5 (1), and the maximum figure of £800, relating to repairs and replacement as proposed in Clause 5 (3) go together? Is the figure of £2,400 in addition to the £800?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the plea made that the construction of an extra bathroom or lavatory should be included. I spoke about Glasgow's housing policy. I believe it has broken down because, as many of my hon. Friends who represent Glasgow constituencies must realise, there are thou- sands of old-age pensioners in five-room apartments and thousands of overcrowded people in two- and three-room apartments, and it seems impossible to put this right. Provision for construction of an extra bathroom or lavatory should be included, if possible, for even in a fiveroomed apartment occupied by a large family the shortage of lavatory facilities can sometimes lead to friction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have only one thing to say about the rent freeze. Glasgow is due to increase its rents on 28th January 1975 and the rent freeze ends on 31st December 1974. Is it intended to give powers back to the local authorities, or do the Government intend to continue the rent freeze?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also agree with the point made earlier about a strict monitoring service being necessary. If the Bill is to succeed the Government must ensure that local authorities keep their end of the bargain and pursue improvement and maintenance of their older houses with all possible speed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before calling the next hon. Member I again wish respectfully to remind hon. Members that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor) would like to rise at 12.20.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is probably a wise thing to say to me as the next speaker, in view of the objection to long speeches which I made last week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Precisely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like many other hon. Members I welcome the Bill, but it is a pity that we do not have further details of What the Government have in mind. I do not wish to be partisan in a political sense, but the Government were in Opposition for three and a half years and it would be helpful, in considering this first measure, to know what other proposals they have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is one think which affects modern Scotland, and which has, for that matter, affected Scotland in the past 25, 30 or even 40 years, it is the joint struggle for jobs and houses. In the past hon. Members have fought for jobs for Scotland on a better and increasing scale, and that fight is now continuing at the same time as the struggle for better housing. It is probably one of the scandals of present society in Scotland that our housing is in such a bad shape.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most hon. Members probably know the figures involved, but 180,000 houses are substandard and as a result of the higher standards relating to tolerability of housing we have an extra 45,000 or so to add to the total. That is encouraging in so far as it reflects improved attitudes. We are beginning to see higher and better standards for tenement flats. All of this means that 10 per cent. of families in Scotland are living in substandard houses and that overcrowding is five times worse than it is in England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

Much has to be done to improve the situation, but if I am impressed by anything it is by the need to improve the environment of our cities, towns and villages. In the past people thought in terms of the number of housing units which could be pushed up. Today new houses are still required on a large scale in Scotland, but we are now beginning to pay more attention to the quality, design, layout and spacing of housing and to the need to improve neighbourhoods. If one does not have a good neighbourhood in terms of layout, design, and so on, standards overall start to decline. We have many examples in Scotland of schemes which started out as being excellent but have sometimes, through neglect and for other reasons, begun to decline. Therefore, it is important for local authorities to pay particular
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0176">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>89</span>
attention to the environment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to discuss what one's attitude should be in approaching this problem. The speeches that we have heard in Committee have come from hon. Members who have been associated with the practical problems emerging at local government level. Certainly their experience ought to be heeded, but in Scotland in the 1970s there is no longer any problem over money. There may be a problem in extorting it from the Treasury, but that is a problem for the political parties in Scotland because Scotland will be producing revenues for the Treasury on a large scale from the oil resources off the Scottish coast. We have to make use of the new political pressures in Scotland to ensure that attention is paid to Scotland's needs. I am talking specifically in terms of housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In recent days, if not months, we have seen the acceptance of the need for a Scottish Development Board, or a board with some similar title, financed by oil revenues. Some talk in terms of industrial development; but we should also think of the social element, and such a board should be responsible for finance for housing needs. Public finance will be available for housing on whatever scale the need requires. We should therefore now concentrate on the need for housing rather than the availability of finance. In Scotland we have unlimited finance for this purpose and we must satisfy the need. In doing so we should pay particular attention to the lessons being learned elsewhere apart from within our borders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to see a survey of building society lending in Scotland. A working party indicated recently that because of the Scottish predilection for saving, a smaller proportion was, perhaps, being reinvested in housing loans in Scotland than was proper. Per head of population the Scots save more in National Savings. Has that amount of finance been available for spending on improving housing in Scotland in the public and the private sectors? I do not think so. These matters require some scrutiny.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In terms of the rather sterile fight between private and public ownership we should experiment with new forms. It would be a mistake for hon. Members on the Government benches to assume that necessarily all their support comes from housing schemes. That is not so. It would also be a mistake for those on the Opposi-
	<span class='label label-info column'>90</span>
tion side of the Committee to assume that they get all the votes coming from the private sector. That is not so. We should look upon the housing needs of the people of Scotland as a whole. Hon. Members will soon learn that many young people in Scotland who might well be voting Labour do wish to buy their houses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whoever has disputed that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some of the recent speeches have suggested that that was not so. I am glad to accept the hon. Gentleman's assurance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not make the mistake—the longer he is a Member, the more he will avoid it—of assuming that the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Lambie) speaks for the Labour Party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for guidance on that subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One should not concentrate on the divisions in housing but should ensure that people's needs are satisfied in all aspects, and that what people want they are given. We should experiment more with housing associations and tenants' co-operatives. This matter was mentioned by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Cook). There is a tenants' co-operative scheme in operation in Norway and perhaps we should see whether such a scheme could be of any help here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In considering the important matters which are raised in housing we should treat this Bill purely as an initial step. I do not think that it satisfies all members of the Committee. It does not satisfy people in my political party. But it is a start. I ask that the Government consider giving whatever finance is required to the Scottish Special Housing Association or to the local authorities to make sure that the housing requirements of the Scottish people, both young and old, are catered for.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Teddy Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It gives me great pleasure to follow the excellent speech of the hon.

We have talked a great deal about money during our discussions. One thing which has been remarkable today, as compared with our debate last week, has been the

	<span class='label label-info column'>91</span>
obvious feeling that my hon. Friends are refreshed, enthusiastic and vigorous in their outlook on housing, coming from our excellent party conference held in Ayr at the weekend. That is particularly so in view of the assurance that we received from our party leader that, on our return to power—which will be very soon—in tackling the major problems of housing, which we have tried to do over the years, we shall have the assistance of a Scottish development fund to deal with social and industrial problems in Scotland. That will help us to do many of the things that we would have liked to do but were unable to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the first housing Bill that we have had from the present Government. Many of us on the Opposition side of the Committee were waiting for it in breathless expectation. I am surprised at the delay in this Bill. Prior to the General Election, for four or five weeks I was responsible for housing in the Scottish Office. A great deal was achieved during that period. At the only Question Time at which I answered Questions the hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Sillars) said that a Tory Government were the scourge of the homeless in Scotland. Then we had the General Election, at which Conservative housing policy was described as disastrous. Then we had the Gracious Speech, delivered by Her Majesty on 12th March, in which it was stated that urgent action would be taken on the housing front, and that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Urgent measures will be taken to reverse the fall in house building, to protect furnished tenants from eviction and to encourage municipal ownership."</p></blockquote>
It mentioned proposals for bringing land required for development into public possession, proposals for encouraging home ownership and proposals to eliminate the lump.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have awaited this urgent action. In dealing with an urgent problem, the Bill presented by the Secretary of State is, on the admission of all hon. Members, largely the Bill introduced on the insistence of my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger), and later taken over by myself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>92</span>
There have been conflicting views expressed about the Bill. When the previous, almost identical, Bill was introduced comments were made by Labour hon. Members. I thought, by and large, that that was a good Bill. I was shattered to hear what was said about it. On 5th February the hon. Member for Glasgow, Queen's Park (Mr. McElhone) said of that Bill, much to my astonishment:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It betrays once again the ignorance and insensitivity of Tory Governments in respect of housing policy."—(OFFICIAL REPORT, 5th February, 1974; Vol. 868, 	<i>c</i>. 1133.)</p></blockquote>
That seemed to be a fairly blanket condemnation. The last thing in the world that I expected was that the new Secretary of State would introduce a virtually identical Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McElhone</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill that we are discussing is not exactly the same as the Bill that we discussed in February. Part of that Bill, on page 138, line 6, to which I referred earlier, was about people who could be evicted in a period of two to four weeks by the sheriff. That is not in the present Labour Government Bill. I could instance other things which were in the previous Bill but have now been omitted. This is a much better Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I found it difficult to understand the hon. Gentleman when he mentioned the eviction question on 5th February. If he had waited until the end of that debate he would have seen that my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Hexham (Mr. Rippon) gave him a full answer to that point and told him that he was completely wrong. It is all recorded Quite clearly in HANSARD. If the hon. Gentleman would care to read the speech—to which he obviously did not listen—made by my right hon. and learned Friend in February I should be glad to pass him —through the usual channels—the copy of HANSARD to save him time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

have heard certain things. He should read the debate. Not only did I wait until the end of it, but my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and I raised points on the Money Resolution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, indeed. I was saying that if the hon. Gentleman had waited until the end of the debate, and not the Money Resolution, he would have heard what was said. Time does not permit me to refer to the Money Resolution. The hon. Gentleman was expressing alarm and concern about the money involved, but the amount is the same as that referred to in the previous Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I come to the meat of the present Bill. This is a good Bill because it will help to upgrade and improve older property. That is one of the things that we need to do in Scotland to help to cope with our housing problem. I put one question to the Minister of State about the demolition or closure of those houses which are not to be improved under the terms of the Bill. The hon. Member for Dundee, East and others have rightly said that there are about 180,000 substandard houses. Our record in this matter over the last few years has been extremely good. It has averaged about 20,000 demolitions or closures. We had a firm plan to get rid of the unsatisfactory houses which could not be improved within five years. Will the Government adhere to that target, which we firmly believed could be achieved?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, an important point was raised by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Cook) when he talked about the problems of carrying out improvements where multiple ownership exists. This has been a big problem in getting agreement by everyone. The previous Bill provided for extended powers for the Housing Corporation so that the corporation could set up a housing association to do this job and get away from the difficulties involved in multiple ownership. My understanding is that the Bill relating to the United Kingdom, presented a few weeks ago by the present Government, carries forward the same proposals that we had in our original Bill. I hope that the Minister can confirm that the extended powers that we would have given to the Housing Corporation under our Housing and Planning Bill will apply under the new Bill relating to the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>94</span>
Much has been said about improvement grants. My hon. Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Ancram) dealt with this matter at some length and explained how the cement strike which was, unfortunately, taking place in his constituency—into which he will be looking thoroughly—had once again presented a problem by holding up improvement jobs which would otherwise have been finished by 23rd June. We had a useful and welcome concession from the Government in allowing these schemes which had been held up by the three-day working week and shortage of supplies to be extended so long as they had been started on 30th September. It was unfortunate, as was suggested by the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy (Mr. Gourlay), that this was offered to only one group and not to the local councils. The Minister may wish to tell us something about the new situation that has been created by the cement strike, because that undoubtedly held up jobs that would otherwise have been completed. Is there any prospect of a further concession to follow the welcome concession that was made by the Government?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a record of improvements on which we can look back with pride because improvements carried out by the previous Government increased from 13,000 in 1968 to 92,000 in 1973. I know that the hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Stewart) and his colleagues will be interested to know that this figure was 25 per cent. of the entire improvement work undertaken in the United Kingdom. That, again, shows the helpful way in which the previous Government looked at the problems of Scotland and tried to assist them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most interesting aspect of the whole debate has been the honest discussion that we have had about the problems of new housing areas. We had a brave and honest speech by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollock (Mr. White). My hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Henderson) also dealt with the problem in great detail. Today we had other well-informed and helpful speeches by my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Pent-lands (Mr. Rifkind) and the hon. Member for Paisley (Mr. Robertson). As was said, we should appreciate that the problems of housing in Scotland are not just those of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0179">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>95</span>
substandard tenement accommodation. My experience and that of most hon. Members is that more people want to move away from houses which are not substandard but are in the peripheral municipal housing schemes than want to move away from substandard tenement properties. Therefore, it would be helpful to know whether the housing acton areas would in any circumstances cover municipal properties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee has agreed that a great deal needs to be done to improve the morale of people in certain of our large housing schemes. We know that there are pockets within these schemes requiring special attention and action. The hon. Member for Paisley said that he understood that nothing was to be done for the municipal schemes. The wording of the Bill does not specifically exclude them. Will the Minister give us some indication of the current position?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another important point on which I hope the Minister will give us some information concerns the morale of people living on these large housing schemes. One way to help to transform the situation to a limited degree would be by the injection of a small amount of owner-occupation in these large schemes. Some hon. Members have posed the question: who would buy a house on some of these large perimeter schemes? I believe that if houses were offered to sitting tenants at low figures that would help to bring a social mix into areas where no mix exists and help to improve the morale of the whole community. This is the experience in areas where there is a mixture of ownership. I believe that many of the problems could be removed if we had more of a mixed community, and the injection of a limited degree of owner-occupation would help to bring that about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the Minister in a position to tell us what kind of programme he envisages for the housing action areas? The Explanatory and Financial Memorandum states that it has been estimated that about £6 million per year will be spent under the various provisions of the Bill after about four or five years. That £6 million has to cover quite a considerable area. What kind of programme does the Minister envisage will go forward? I appreciate that this financial estimate is not a limitation. It does not say only £6 million. It is an estimate made on the basis of the terms of the Bill. On the other hand, it would be helpful if the hon. Gentleman could give us an idea of the number of housing
	<span class='label label-info column'>96</span>
action areas he envisages and of how many houses are likely to be improved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Has any further work been done on the likely cost of renovation? Almost everyone today has agreed that the renovation and improvement of old tenement property is a good idea. My experience, as a member of the Glasgow Town Council when the hon. Member for Glasgow, Springburn (Mr. Buchanan) was an excellent city treasurer, was that specific schemes appeared to be extremely expensive. It was not a matter of spending £2,000, £3,000, £4,000 or £5,000, but of looking at a specific tenement job and posing the question: how can we make three houses into two, provide better amenities for all concerned, and make sure that the structure is safe? The costs were frightening and in some cases prohibitive. If we are to look forward to a major programme, may I ask whether more work has been done to get an idea of the costs involved in such changes?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Spring-burn referred to consultation. I agree with the hon. Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Doig) that it is not enough to have a notice in the 	<i>Dundee Courier</i> or 	<i>The Glasgow Herald,</i> that it is not enough to put up a notice which might be ripped down, and that it is not enough to have a public meeting which elderly people may not attend. It is important, when a housing action area proposal comes forward, that individual people affected should receive an indication in plain language of any plan and how it will affect them. My hon. Friend the Member for Ayr, as Under-Secretary of State in the previous Government, took many steps to try to ensure that letters about rent increases were in simple terms that people could understand. I hope that the same will be done regarding housing action areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister tell us about the rights of tenants? This question was raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands. Those who have heard and read of experience in Glasgow, where municipal houses in Knightswood are being improved, are aware that though the end result may be desirable a large number of tenants are complaining bitterly that their lives are being disrupted, that not enough attention is being paid to them when their houses are being improved, and that they have to move out or vacate part of the properties. Will the Minister assure us that local authorities will be obliged to have regard to the needs
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0180">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>97</span>
of the tenants when improvements are taking place?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the time available to me I should like to mention three specific points. The first concerns repairs. The introduction of the repairs grant in the previous legislation was a useful advance in helping to alleviate housing problems in Scotland. Repairs represent a considerable cost to some of the new owner-occupiers of tenement properties and to the owners of other houses. Will repairs grants be specifically limited to housing action areas? If so, will proposals regarding housing action areas go forward in many or only a few towns in Scotland?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point is on Clause 44 which relates to advances by local authorities for house purchase. What is the extent of flexibility introduced in that clause? The previous legislation allowed for variable payments to be made over the period of the loan. How much additional variation is there in this clause? If the payments at the beginning of the mortgage period do not cover the interest on the loan, then someone who had such a variable mortgage could, at the end of two years, if he sold the house, owe more than he had borrowed. Will the Minister tell us something about that situation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point relates to Clause 45 and compensation for the rent freeze. Different opinions have been expressed within the Conservative Party about the rent freeze. My hon. Friend the Member for Ayr, in a splendid speech, gave one side of the story, but, as the Minister will be aware, we did not vote against the rent freeze proposal. However, we all agree that if a rent freeze is to apply it should apply to all, not to some.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important point concerns the 80 per cent. compensation for local authorities. Why 80 per cent.? Why not full compensation for the lost revenue? The Minister must be aware that people in Scotland are concerned about the prospect of massive rate rises taking place this year and, in particular, next year, when we have local government reform. Actions taken by the Government—for example, putting VAT on petrol and on many other charges accruing to local authorities—have created a situation in which many local authority treasurers are regarding their accounts and estimates as virtual nightmares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should be fully aware of the serious alarm throughout Scotland about the increase in rates this year. It will be an additional blow if one effect of the rent
	<span class='label label-info column'>98</span>
freeze is that everyone—municipal and private tenants and owner-occupiers—has to pay even more rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will deal with the specific point made by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Springburn referring to Glasgow where, because of the failure by the corporation to introduce the Housing Finance Act increases on time, the increase is not to apply until the end of January 1975. Does that mean that Glasgow tenants will not get the advantage that is offered to others as a result of the freeze?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will be able to answer the point about the rates, because we have not yet had an indication of the anticipated increase this year. This matter is causing serious alarm throughout Scotland among householders and industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By and large we welcome the Bill. It is a good Bill, largely because we drafted it and meant to make it work. I hope that the Minister will indicate that he intends to pursue the clauses and the additional powers given in the Bill with the same vigour and enthusiasm with which they would have been pursued by a Conservative administration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Mr. Bruce Millan)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been asked a great many questions during the debate, and in the short time available to me I will try to answer many of them. Before doing so, I should like to put the Bill in its proper context regarding the Government's housing policy as a whole. This is partly for the benefit of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor) and of some of my hon. Friends. This is not the whole of the Government's housing policy. We have already frozen rents by order. A Bill will be presented soon on furnished tenancies. I am sure my hon. Friends will welcome that. Later this year, as soon as we can prepare it, there will be a Bill on housing subsidies and finance putting our policy for these important subjects in place of what was in the Housing (Financial Provisions) (Scotland) Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from legislation, we intend to increase considerably the number of houses built to rent in Scotland. That is all the more necessary bearing in mind that, under the previous Government, the number of houses built to rent in Scotland went down from 34,000 in 1970 to only 17,000 in 1973. I have not checked on the four weeks that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0181">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>99</span>
was responsible, but I dare say that he gave the figure another little downward push while he was at the Scottish Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the situation that we inherited. There is a lot to be done, not just by way of this Bill, but by other measures on housing policy. The Bill is a considerable improvement on the legislation introduced by the previous Government, as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State explained last week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman referred to the low number of houses built by the previous administration. Is he prepared to state a figure that he regards as a suitable number of houses to be built by the Labour administration?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. On this matter I prefer to take the advice of the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) who made a powerful speech today in which he said that it was very foolish to set targets of that kind. We shall certainly improve considerably on the previous Government's record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to some of the detailed points that have been made on the provisions of the Bill. The first point refers to the definition of the standards for determining housing action areas. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Queen's Park (Mr. McElhone) questioned the social factors to be included in the criteria. I do not wish to go into detail now because those and many other matters can be raised in Standing Committee. However, many of the problems concerning my hon. Friend and myself—for example, environmental factors—can be dealt with under existing legislation. That legislation is available in Scotland and will be made available in England in an English Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The situation is not quite the same but I take the point and I give the assurance that it is being dealt with already.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the point of my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Cook) that if compulsory purchase is involved there can be considerable delay. I hope that the procedures outlined in the Bill, which, in some circumstances and with agreement, give the local authority the opportunity of doing the whole job and not relying on individual owner-occupiers, will reduce considerably the necessity for compulsory purchase orders. That is a
	<span class='label label-info column'>100</span>
matter which we can consider in Standing Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make the general point that I hope that local authorities will treat the Bill seriously and with enthusiasm. I hope that a large authority will not just designate one housing action area and later move on to the next but that it will designate a fair number of housing action areas so that there will be a rolling programme. By so doing the authority will be able to account for any delays that occur. If possible we want to eliminate delays, but some of the means of doing so are within the power of the local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to the matter of minimising inconvenience to owner-occupiers and to those living in a local authority house. First, I point out that provisions are in the Bill for security of tenure. I hope that the local authorities in carrying out schemes of improvement will ensure that the tenant is inconvenienced to the minimum. It must be clear that the job cannot be done with no inconvenience. I have experienced such matters in my constituency. It is necessary to tell tenants that if they want certain improvements made there must be a degree of inconvenience. All we can do is to ask that the local authorities minimise the inconvenience. Anybody who needs rehousing will be rehoused by the local authority concerned under statutary obligation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Central has referred to environmental improvement. I repeat that there are special provisions available for such improvement which have been used on a substantial scale by Scottish local authorities. If there are any deficiencies in this or any other matter I shall be happy to consider such matters in Standing Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the kind of Bill which enables us to consider any constructive points which are made in Committee. I shall do so with the real object of improving the terms of the Bill. That will be the approach that I shall bring to our proceedings. If hon. Members have points on which they are not clear, or if they feel that some additional information supplied before our proceedings in Standing Committee would help them. I shall do everything I can to give them that information so that our discussions can be as constructive as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point that I was wishing to make is not that there are not grants available for dealing with the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0182">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>101</span>
environment but that there are difficulties in situations of multiple ownership—for example, 50 owner-occupiers and half a dozen under-capitalised landlords—in making use of the grants. There is difficulty in using the grants to deal with the common back area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take my hon. Friend's point, but I have already said that Clause 43 enables the local authority to do the job for the individual owners by agreement. Of course, there are difficulties. So far as we can do so by statute we are trying to put everything into the Bill that can possibly be helpful. However, there are other matters which should go in which are not in at the moment. I am receptive to suggestions by my hon. Friends or by Oppositon hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answer to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart is that repair grants are available only in housing action areas. If we are to give priority to certain matters I think that that is a useful first step to take. I have been asked about the flexibility of definition of housing action areas by the hon. Member for Ayr and by other hon. Members. We have tried to provide in Clause 18 the maximum of flexibility. However, if there are possible improvements to that clause we shall consider the possibility of improving it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the question of local authority housing because a good deal of the discussion today, and rightly so, was related to the inadequacies of many of our council house schemes. A number of hon. Members have asked what the Bill does for local authority housing. The provisions for dealing with local authority housing improvements are already in existing legislation and they have been used to a considerable extent. That is, incidentally and very importantly, legislation at the expense of the central taxpayer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall explain the grant provisions. Up to 23rd June of this year the rate of grant is 75 per cent. for local authority housing improvements. There was a temporary increase of the rate. It must be remembered that the housing expenditure subsidy is paid on the balance. When we take account of the housing expenditure subsidy of 80 per cent. of the balance of 25 per cent., the present grant is 95 per cent. from central Government. Even when we reduce the direct grant of 75 per cent. by
	<span class='label label-info column'>102</span>
50 per cent., but take account of the housing expenditure subsidy of the balance, the bulk of the expenditure is provided by central Government. That is the direct answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley (Mr. Robertson) whether it is about Ferguslie Park, Blackhill or anywhere else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Henderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These grants from Government are available at the moment. The previous Government suspended approvals for local authority housing improvement schemes in January of this year. We have limited that suspension and we shall discuss with the local authorities the priorities in local authority housing improvements. Whatever comes out of those discussions I cannot imagine that they will exclude as schemes of the highest priority the Ferguslie Park and Blackhill schemes. If local authorities decide that they want to introduce schemes for improvement of that kind of area, and while 1 recognise the need for improvements in some areas, it is unfair to place any blame on central Government. It is a local authority responsibility. Central Government will continue to provide substantial financial assistance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Ferguslie Park scheme has had special attention from the Government in terms of community development and other criteria. It is not true to say that central Government under successive parties have ignored the problems of such areas. I accept that the problems are considerable and that they are of a social as well as of a physical nature. The Government will do everything possible to help the local authorities with such problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One way in which we do not think that the situation would be helped is by local authorities selling off council houses to sitting tenants. In Scottish circumstances that seems to be highly inappropriate and extremely damaging in areas of housing shortage. It is an irony that the policy of the Conservative Party, which dislikes subsidies, so it tells us, and which especially dislikes subsidies to the better-off members of the community, according to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart in a speech made in Ayr during the weekend, is not only to sell off council houses but to sell them to tenants at reduced prices at the expense of giving substantial subsidies, by definition, to those council
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0183">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>103</span>
house tenants who are at present better off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The particular help that has been given to mortgage payers and which was introduced by this Government—namely, the additional help to the building societies—inevitably goes to some considerable extent to people who are better off rather than to the less well-off members of the community. That assistance has been supported by Opposition hon. Members. There is no kind of subsidy system available in housing which can be directed only to the poorest members of the community. Any subsidy system so directed would not be worth while. We have to try to achieve a subsidy system which gives help so far as possible to those most in need. In terms of housing a large percentage of the population, because of inflation, the rising cost of land and the rising price of housing, is in need of central Government or local government assistance. Under this Government that is what we intend to see happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Next, I deal with the 75 per cent. grant extension beyond 23rd June. This is a matter of drawing a line somewhere. It is inevitable that wherever the line is drawn there will be some who finish on the wrong side. The fact is that the grant was a temporary scheme of additional grant. It was not intended to be permanent. I think that that was the right decision, given the terms of our housing resources. We have made a concession which, we think, will bring into the higher rate of grant all those who at the time of getting local authority approval could reasonably have expected the work to be completed by the initial deadline of 23rd June. I am not saying that there will be no one excluded in the concession which we have made. However, we have tried to deal with as many as possible of what would otherwise be extremely hard cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to the subsidy and the help which will be given to local authorities by an order produced under the terms of
	<span class='label label-info column'>104</span>
the Bill in respect of the loss of rent income arising from the rent freeze. Interestingly enough, as far as I know no local authority has complained to central Government about the 80 per cent. announcement that my right hon. Friend has made. In that instance there is a strong case for saying that there should be substantial contribution from central Government and a certain contribution from the local authorities. After all, many local authorities were asking us to impose a rent freeze, including most of the Scottish Labour authorities. I think that we have the balance just about right, but that is a matter which we can discuss laer. As I say, there will have to be an order produced under the terms of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I reassert, as there seems to be some misunderstanding, that the rent standstill applies to private rents as well as local authority rents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Second, on a point brought to my attention by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Queen's Park, where applications for increased rents are being made under the fair rent scheme they will not become operative till 1st January 1975. I have taken steps to see that rent registration officers, in giving notices to tenants, make that matter clear in the letters that they send out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have dealt with some of the points that have been raised during our debate. I obviously have not answered all the points in what has been a wide-ranging discussion about housing in Scotland. I repeat that the Bill is an important contribution towards our housing policy but is not by itself the total of that policy. We have introduced certain pieces of policy already and more will be coming. The Bill, along with other items of policy, represents a determined attack by the Government on what are still appalling housing conditions in many parts of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the Government's most important commitments is that we do everything possible on our own initiative, and in consultation and co-operation with local authorities, to reduce and eliminate as far as possible the difficult and damaging housing problems that we still unfortunately face in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
