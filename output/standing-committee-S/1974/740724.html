	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General (Mr. Peter Archer)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee have considered the Legal Advice and Assistance (Financial Conditions) Regulations 1974.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think it might be for the convenience of the Committee if we discussed the remaining three statutory instruments with this one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is the Committee's wish, it will be convenient to this side.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As you have already indicated, Mr. Brewis, there are before the Committee four sets of regulations. They relate to legal advice and assistance in England and Wales, and to legal aid in England and Wales. For the benefit of members of the Committee who are not accustomed to legal terminology, it may be of assistance if I indicate that the distinction between the two is that legal aid is primarily for litigation, whereas advice and assistance are normally where what is required is not representation or assistance in the steps in an action, but simply advice, either where no action is necessary or before an action has been initiated. There are those two sets of regulations in relation to England and Wales, and two similar sets in relation to Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In each case the purpose is twofold. It is to increase the upper income limit of eligibility for aid and advice. It is to increase the upper limit for free aid and advice. Between the two, there is an income belt where an applicant would be eligible for aid and advice on payment of a financial contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These regulations do not purport to represent an increase in the scope of the legal aid scheme. This is a routine increase to keep pace with inflation. When the income limits were last increased, at
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
the end of last year, with effect from 1st January, it was announced by the Government then in office that they would be reviewed annually, to stay abreast with increases in supplementary benefits, which are upgraded annually. We welcomed that announcement. There is nothing between the two sides of the Committee on that policy. This is the result of the first annual review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 22nd July, supplementary benefit rates were increased. The ordinary, short-term rate was increased from £7·15 to £8·40 a week, which represents an increase of 17·48 per cent. These regulations increase the aid and advice limits by the same percentage, subject to the amounts being rounded up or down to the nearest convenient figure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The legal aid regulations raise the disposable income limits for legal aid from £1,175 to £1,380 per annum. The disposable income, which is the unit used for this purpose, means the net income after deductions for income tax, rates, rent, and certain other expenses. The limits for free legal aid are raised from a disposable annual income of £375 to one of £440. The financial limit on advice and assistance is calculated differently, but still in terms of disposable income; and the limit of eligibility for advice and assistance is raised from £24.50 per week to £28 per week. The limit for advice and assistance free of contribution is also to be increased similarly, but not in these regulations because, for historical reasons, those regulations do not require an affirmative resolution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be those whose who wish that these increases were greater and that there had been a corresponding increase in capital limits. I repeat that this is a routine increase to keep pace with living costs. The Advisory Committe is considering the whole basis of financial limits for aid and advice. It has asked for the views of the Supplementary Benefits Commission and the Law Society, and is looking at capital limits in that context. It would be sensible to await its report before considering any further increases. Meanwhile, this simply represents the running that we have to do to stay in the same place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.36 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Waddington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We on this side of the Committee welcome these
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0490">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
regulations and we are glad that the Government are implementing the proposals made by the previous Government that there should be annual reviews.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similar regulations were debated in October 1973, and the present Attorney-General, the right hon. and learned Member for Dulwich (Mr. Silkin), gave what he described as a grudging welcome because they did not go quite as far as the Lord Chancellor's Committee had recommended. The right hon. and learned Gentleman went on to say that it seemed somewhat discourteous that the work done by that committee was not recognised by a mention in the Explanatory Notes attached to each of those regulations. He said that perhaps, after all, that omission was not a matter of discourtesy, but was born of shame. I merely point out to the Committee that the Advisory Committee is still not mentioned in the Explanatory Notes attached to each of these regulations, and the explanation may be that the increase now provided for is only slightly higher than that recommended by the Lord Chancellor's Committee in January 1973.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In January 1973, the Lord Chancellor's Committee recommended legal aid limits of £400 and £1,250 respectively. Now, 18 months later, the limits are to be £440, which is only a 10 per cent. increase, and £1,450. As to legal advice, the committee recommended the sum of £27 in January 1973, and now, 18 months later, the limit will be £28. The Government are not putting right what in October 1973 they were saying, with some vehemence, the then Government were doing wrong. They have, as the Solicitor-General has rightly said, merely taken steps to keep up with the ever-flowing tide of inflation, to make good that erosion of the value of the increases made by the last Government which has taken place as a result of inflation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The truth of the matter is that there will, after today, still be many people who will not be able to litigate because of the cost of proceedings and the risk of paying the costs of the other side if they lose. I appreciate that it will be necessary, I hope sooner rather than later, for there to be a complete re-thinking about the financial limits of legal aid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition are glad that the Lord Chancellor's Committee is now carrying
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
out a full-scale study of the whole problem and the working of the scheme, and in particular of the basis of the financial limits. It is worth noting that in the 1971–72 report, at paragraph 10, reference was made by the Lord Chancellor's Committee to its earlier recommendation that the limits should be linked to the tax credit scheme then proposed. It pointed out in paragraph 10:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If this could be done there would be no need for the Commission to determine disposable income because eligibility for legal aid, either free or contributory, would depend upon the level of income for tax credit purposes. This would markedly reduce the time taken in processing legal aid applications, save a considerable amount of public funds as it now costs the Commission over £1 million to determine resources, 'and would also save their manpower."</p></blockquote>
I am not, of course, making out a case for the tax credit scheme; I am merely pointing out that there the Lord Chancellor's Committee was emphasising how complicated the present scheme is to administer, and how comparatively expensive and wasteful of manpower. We earnestly hope that this review will go ahead as soon as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to mention one matter referred to in the 1972–73 Report, at paragraph 16. The Committee there said that the Legal Advice Scheme was failing to reach many of those for whom it was designed because it did not take sufficient account of rent, travelling costs and other expenses. I should be grateful for any comments which the Solicitor-General can make on that aspect of the matter. The Legal Advice Scheme is very simple to operate, where the solicitor is provided with a form which he can complete from the information given him by the customer. Could not steps be taken, by alterations in the various scales provided for on the form, to meet that point made by the Lord Chancellor's Committee, if it has not already been dealt with?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, is the Solicitor-General in a position to say anything at all today about any proposals there may be for bringing into force Part II of the 1972 Act? Otherwise, with those comments, we on this side of the Committee welcome these Regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.42 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Lawson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not want to oppose a good Scottish theorem or
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0491">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
delay the passing of these Instruments. I appreciate the point made about having a more thorough look into this matter, but need we be so tight in drawing both the upper and lower limits? At the moment I am more concerned with the lower than the upper limit. The lower limit of £440 is substantially below the new pension level. I may be wrong—no doubt, my hon. and learned Friend will put me right if I am—but it looks to me as if even a single person drawing the new pension of £10 a week, which is £520 a year, would still be required to pay, if he was concerned in some matter of this kind, and the clear legal aid would not be met. He would, of course, have a substantial contribution towards his costs, but I should have thought that we could have taken the pension level as the very floor below which no one would fall, in terms of having to meet such a cost. When we bear in mind that the new rate for a couple will be £832 and for a single person £520, and we are putting down here a limit lower than £440, we might have gone further, despite the fact that this is under review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to ask a question which, although it may be outwith the scope of these instruments, is not outwith the scope of legal aid. It concerns the very heavy cost of public inquiries where the interests of one person or a group of persons are severely jeopardised by some decision taken, for example, by a public authority or some other very powerful group and they find themselves compelled to fight these decisions. Up to this stage there is no legal aid, although various important bodies, including the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs, in a very valuable report called "Land Use in Scotland ", have recommended that in this connection legal aid should be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would my hon. and learned Friend tell us whether this matter has now been considered—I hate to use the phrase " taken on board "—and whether we are likely to hear fairly soon that assistance will be given, with proper safeguards, in matters of this kind as well as in the narrower concept of legal aid?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.46 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Member for Nelson and Colne
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
(Mr. Waddington) not surprisingly seized the opportunity to make the comment that we were not in these regulations rectifying the defects pointed out by my right hon. and learned Friend the present Attorney-General in October 1973. My hon. Friend the Member for Motherwell and Wishaw (Mr. Lawson) made, to some extent, the same point when he pointed out that the lower limit of £440 per annum is in many ways a surprisingly low limit, having regard to what is happening in other parts of the economy and in some of our social welfare provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Member for Nelson and Colne, becoming a little more detailed, said that in the comments of the Lord Chancellor's Advisory Committee on the 23rd Report of the Law Society it was pointed out that the new scheme for advice and assistance failed to take account of certain items of expenditure which operate partially on particular individuals. All these matters are very much in the mind of the Government. The Committee will not have overlooked the fact that my noble Friend the Lord Chancellor made it clear in the debate after the Gracious Speech that we regard these matters as of very great priority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can only say today that the purpose of these regulations is very limited and I understand that neither the hon. and learned Gentleman nor my hon. Friend have overlooked that. It would have been out of place, in regulations whose purpose was to fulfil a certain limited and specific purpose of bringing legal aid limits into line with supplementary benefit increases, to try to introduce anything which went further in the field of extending legal aid, however important that might be. These matters are very much under consideration. The paragraph quoted by the hon. and learned Member for Nelson and Collie from the comments of the Legal Aid Committee itself points out that the financial limits are being studied and that the Law Society's Supplementary Benefits Commission has been asked to include them in their general study.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the wider, but perfectly proper, point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Motherwell, that there are whole areas where people clearly need advice and assistance for which that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0492">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
advice and assistance is not available. I can only repeat that these regulations are not where one would expect to find this, but the point has certainly not been overlooked. Many of us made again and again in opposition the point my hon. Friend has made this morning. I certainly do not propose to say anything in government which is inconsistent with what I said in opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are areas where we have given rights to ordinary people which will be quite ineffective unless they have access to advice about what those rights are and how they can exercise them. To give rights to the public only increases the gap between those who have knowledgeable friends, those who are articulate and can read complicated English without getting lost, and those who seem condemned always to be at the losing end. It will make the position of the little guy even worse if we do not provide him with the means for legal aid and advice. That point is certainly taken on board, but I am sure that my hon. Friend will appreciate, as will the hon. and learned Gentleman, that the Government having been in office—in trying circumstances—for only a few months and still awaiting the report of the Lord Chancellor's Committee, today is not the occasion when we can recognise it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
