<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I, on behalf of the Committee, extend a very warm welcome to our new Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown), and I hope that he will be a useful member of the Committee and will enjoy the work.</span></p>
<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee have considered</p></blockquote></p>
<p>Class IV, Vote 17, Trade, Industry and Employment (Scottish Economic Planning Department),</p>
<p>Class VIII, Vote 5, Other Environmental Services, Scotland, and</p>
<p>Class XIII, Vote 23, Other Services: Scottish Office.—[<i>Mr. Millan.</i>]</p>
<p>10.31 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I first, Sir Myer, echo your words of congratulation to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown), whom we are delighted has got this appointment. If he is ever lacking in agricultural advice, there are some of us who will be very glad to help him in his duties in the same way as I appreciated his advice when I was in his job, when he helped me in a number of matters related to the Home Department and other things. We certainly very much welcome him here this morning.<br><br>
Our subject for debate this morning, namely planning procedures, particularly in relation to North Sea oil, is particularly appropriate. Whether we represent constituencies in the North-East or in the Highlands, where clearly we know more about and see far more of these pressures than people elsewhere, no one in Scotland today cannot but be aware of the tremendous concern and feeling that is expressed in different places and in different ways about the various oil development activities that are taking place.<br><br>
This reaches its point of greatest pressure in the debate that surrounds the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 54</span>
whole question of the siting, building and type of oil production platforms. As I see it, this concern takes two forms, and they are two slightly contradictory forms which it is clearly the job of Government to try to resolve. It is this that I shall try to probe, with the Under-Secretary, this morning—I hope in a constructive and helpful way—because it is vital for all of us in Scotland that we get these matters right, not only so far as present oil development is concerned, but even more so in regard to future generations of people living in Scotland. If we get it wrong, I think that we shall have some terrible results which our children and our children's children might have to live with for many years to come.<br><br>
The first pressure that I should like to identify this morning is from those who believe that we should see our benefits from offshore oil exploited and taken advantage of as quickly as possible. This is clearly something very much in the national interest; something on which, when my party was in Government, we endeavoured to move forward with the greatest possible speed. I do not intend to rehearse the arguments here this morning, because we all know how absolutely vital it is, not only for Scotland but for the United Kingdom, that we get the advantages from offshore oil and from the savings in balance of payments as quickly as we possibly can. This will be important to the standard of living of every man and woman in this country, and every year or month that we can save in realising this is important to us as a nation.<br><br>
It is also important, bringing it down to an even narrower time-scale, so far as the oil production platforms are concerned. We have seen in the last week or so the launching of two of these production platforms, one from Graythorp and the other, which the Secretary of State himself launched, at Methil in Fife. We are all aware of the tremendous pressure on those firms to make sure they launched them in time to have them in position in the North Sea so that the work of fixing them could take place before next winter.<br><br>
We see the same thing happening in the constituency of my Friend the hon. Member for Ross and Cromarty (Mr. Gray). There has been concern over delays. The firm concerned has made efforts to ensure that there is no delay, because if one misses what is called the "weather window", and these production
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0252">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 55</span>
platforms are not sited before the winter it is not a question of losing a month or so of production from the oil wells in the North Sea, but of losing a whole year's production. This demonstrates that a week's delay in the summer months could mean a whole year's delay in the oil coming ashore, and it emphasises the case made by those who believe in the importance of speed to get as much benefit from North Sea oil as quickly as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. T. G. D. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend not remember the old saying, "act in haste, repent at leisure"?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was not recommending something; I was merely describing what is taking place at the present time and the pressure that those of us in the oil constituencies have to take into account. It is a very real pressure, and I was not saying that one should act in haste. People who put forward this point of view genuinely feel that if we lose these benefits it will be very serious indeed for this country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Baxter</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am just at the beginning of this debate. With respect to the hon. Gentleman, I do not want to take too long as I know it is a subject that concerns many people and I want to keep my remarks fairly short to give as much opportunity as possible for others to speak.<br><br>
The second matter about which there is considerable worry—and here I return to what my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith) said—is the effect that this will have on our environment if the planning of sites for building the rigs is not properly carried out and, secondly, if there is a proliferation of sites. This is a very real worry for people in Scotland.<br><br>
I share the concern that has been expressed by the hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. MacCormick), who I am sorry to see is not here this morning, as his constituency is one of those chiefly affected. I share the concern of the people in Argyll about the number of applications that have been made. There was a very useful map
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 56</span>
of Argyll in the <i>Scotsman</i> a week or so ago which demonstrated that there are applications for sites in Argyll in eight or nine different places. Seeing the way in which some of these applications have been handled, I have the utmost sympathy for those living in areas affected. This demonstrates the kind of problem that is worrying many people in Scotland.<br><br>
There is also concern that our planning procedures are not adequate to cope with the pressure for these sites and that this will have consequences for the economy of Scotland. If sites and opportunities for the building of these production platforms are not available in Scotland—we already know, for example, that Burmah Oil may have to place its orders for production platforms overseas—there will be certain serious consequences for delay. There is obviously concern over the loss of jobs, and anything that causes a potential loss of jobs in Scotland worries us.<br><br>
The second thing that worries me—and this is related to the loss of jobs—is that if we do not succeed in winning the orders for building the production platforms we shall lose the associated work that goes with the platforms. The platforms themselves are one thing, and proliferation of sites and destruction of the environment are causes for worry, but I am equally worried that if we do not obtain the orders for the production of the platforms we may also lose the orders for the modules and all the associated equipment that goes with the platforms. Experience elsewhere has shown that orders for the associated work tends very often to go to the areas or countries where the production platforms are built.<br><br>
This is a matter of particular consequence to the West of Scotland. The pressure for the building of the rigs is on areas where there are deep-water coastal sites. I want to make sure that it is not only areas such as the Highlands and the North-East that share in the work of offshore oil development, but that firms in our substantial and well-established engineering industry in the West of Scotland benefit fully from the associated work that goes with offshore oil. All of us must realise that unless we make the production platforms—this may be one of the costs that we have to pay in certain ways—we are less likely to have all the associated work from which I believe the West of Scotland and Central Scotland in particular could benefit.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0253">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 57</span>
The third thing that worries me is that if we cannot cope with the pressure for the building of platforms and get a reasonable share of orders for their construction we shall in the long term lose the base that we should rightfully have for the new deep-water oil production technology. This is the most important thing in the longer term.<br><br>
In the shorter term, it is basically a matter of jobs, whether in the Highlands, the North-East or in the support that industry in the West of Scotland and the central belts of Scotland can give. In the longer term, if oil is to mean anything to Scotland, it is in the new technology which Scotland can build up and in which future generations can share.<br><br>
It is no exaggeration to say that during the first Industrial Revolution, in the last century and the early years of this century, Scotland led the world in engineering and shipbuilding technology. We could again, in the latter half of this century, lead the world in deep-water oil exploration and production technology.<br><br>
I feel this very strongly, and say it from having talked to those who are involved in the industry, particularly in Aberdeen. The real long-term benefits for Scotland lie not merely in what Scottish industry and Scottish people can gain from the present developments off the Scottish coast. By securing a base through our universities and firms, and in many other ways, we can build for the next generation of technologists, wherever the oil exploration or production takes place, whether in Scottish or British waters, or off the coasts of America or anywhere else in the world. If we miss out on the oil-production platform technology, we may find ourselves opting out of future generations of technology in the later years of this century and even the early years of the next one. It is a particularly important matter at the present time.<br><br>
I appreciate that a great deal of activity is already taking place. I believe that about nine production platforms sites have been approved in Scotland. It is worth emphasising in passing—and I am sure that the Minister of State will confirm this—that nine of the sites were approved before the firms were ready to start operations. Therefore, up to now, we have managed to cope reasonably well. In the case of the one other site on the north coast of Scotland, about which there was a public inquiry, the decision
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 58</span>
not to proceed was taken after approval had been given.<br><br>
Up to now, we have probably not lost very much in the building of these production platforms, but we now have to appreciate that the pace of building them is increasing. Perhaps the Minister will be able to give us more up-to-date figures this morning, but I believe that about 14 platforms have already been ordered, of which seven are likely to be built in Scotland. I also believe that there are likely to be another 12 orders in the course of the next year. Therefore, one can see that this is a rapidly expanding industry.<br><br>
Many of us have felt concern about the building of these platforms, but the pressures will become real over the next six or 12 months and the debate this morning is important because we must crystallise our ideas on how to cope with this increasing pressure.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Strang) was reported last week, when speaking to the Forth Valley Chamber of Commerce, as emphasising the need for more fabrication sites within Scotland. A week earlier, the Secretary of State himself, when he launched the rig of a production platform at Methil, warned, I think quite fairly, against the danger of the proliferation of sites. Again, the Minister of State, speaking in the last debate on the Floor of the House on 2nd April, spelled out and recognised very fairly some of the difficulties over planning and the sites needed for these oil production platforms. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I hope that soon after Easter we shall be able to indicate how we have decided to proceed."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 2nd April, 1974; Vol. 871, c. 1164.]</p></blockquote>
I know that there are many problems, and I am not seeking to be difficult on this, but the hon. Gentleman did say that he hoped he would be able to tell us some time after Easter how the Government hoped to proceed with the production of these platform sites, yet so far we have had no announcement and no firm indication from the Government of how they intend to proceed over planning procedures. I hope that this morning's debate will be useful in eliciting from the Government what their policy is and how they intend to proceed, because this concerns many of us.<br><br>
I believe that this is why we must look at the adequacy of the existing procedures.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0254">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 59</span>
For this reason, on 31st January this year, Mr. Gordon Campbell, when he was Secretary of State for Scotland, put forward certain proposals which we believed were necessary to deal with this situation. I am aware that these proposals were, in one sense, fairly dramatic, and I know that they did not receive universal acclaim or universal acceptance, but I believe that they provided one solution to the present dilemma.<br><br>
I know that one of the main worries that some people had about the proposals put forward then was about the powers that the Government were taking by legislation in order to develop the oil production platform sites, but I believe that concentration on that one aspect had the effect of detracting from many of the other benefits which would have come from the proposals.<br><br>
There has been a lot of loose talk about our proposals since that time, but I ask hon. Members to read again the statement in the House of Commons on 31st January and the exchanges that took place afterwards. It is clear to me, and 1 know that this was very much in the mind of Gordon Campbell at the time, and it is implicit, if not explicit in the exchanges that took place in the House on 31st January, that a procedure of that sort would have tremendous benefits in meeting the present situation.<br><br>
I should like to mention three of them briefly. First, as Mr. Gordon Campbell made clear on that occasion, the procedures which we put forward would have had the advantage of positively identifying sites on the coast of Scotland where the kind of development that we are discussing would have been appropriate. I believe that positive action of that nature would have been of considerable advantage. In particular, it would have avoided the kind of proliferation that is taking place in Argyll, and which the Secretary of State mentioned when he launched the rig at Methil a week ago. As Mr. Gordon Campbell emphasised when he put forward these proposals, these powers would be used sparingly, and they would be restricted to land required for the production—and I emphasise the word "production"—of offshore oil and gas.<br><br>
The second main benefit of our proposals is that they would have written into any form of legislation that was brought
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 60</span>
forward strict control over the use of such sites. I believe that the control would have been as great, if not greater, than what would have been available under existing planning procedures. Perhaps most important of all, there would have been strict control over the restoration of sites.<br><br>
One thing that worries hon. Members and people in Scotland more than anything else is what is to happen to the site when this form of construction is completed. If we can make certain that the site is restored or that it is adapted in some way to a tourist or an industrial use that can continue after the need to build these platforms is over, that will be acceptable to many of us.<br><br>
The third benefit from the kind of proposals that were put forward on that occasion is that, even under the form of procedure that we were putting forward, there would have been full scope for representation to the Secretary of State. At the end of the day, any proposals put forward would have been subject to parliamentary procedure, and this is important. There would have been an opportunity to debate in the House proposals that were put forward.<br><br>
I believe that in those three ways—identification of sites, control of the sites and their subsequent restoration, and scope for full representation and for parliamentary control— the proposals that were put forward on that occasion would, to a great degree, have met the kind of situation that I described in the earlier part of my speech this morning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Baxter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a very important statement that the shadow Secretary of State has given to the Committee this morning. He is telling us what his predecessor, Mr. Gordon Campbell, proposed. Is the hon. Gentleman in favour of those proposals? If he became the Secretary of State for Scotland, are those the proposals that he would place before Parliament?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should not be putting forward these proposals if I did not believe that there was merit in them; I should not have been putting them forward in the way I am. I should have thought that that was absolutely clear from what I have said this morning. We put forward our proposals on that occasion, and I believe that had we been returned to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0255">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 61</span>
office on 28th February we should have put them into effect.<br><br>
What worries me—and this is why I think this debate should be useful—is that we have gone from 28th February until now without knowing precisely what steps the Government are taking. I appreciate, as the hon. Gentleman said in the debate on 2nd April, that the Government wanted to proceed with the Drumbuie inquiry and wait until that was over before they came to any final conclusions. This is a point of view which the hon. Gentleman justified then and which he will no doubt justify again this morning, but what worries me and some of my hon. Friends is that we are losing months. When we talk of the weather window, a matter of months can automatically be extended into a matter of years in getting these benefits from offshore oil.<br><br>
Therefore, I wish to ask the hon. Gentleman two specific questions. I do not expect him to say anything about the likely result of the Drumbuie inquiry, but I ask him to say, as this seems to be the obstacle to getting a full policy statement from the Government on planning procedures, when we shall get the results of that inquiry. The Secretary of State's decision on that inquiry will then enable us, I hope, to obtain a fuller statement on planning policy. I should be grateful if he could give us information on that this morning. Secondly, and obviously consequent upon that, can the Minister tell us when the Government will be able to put forward their full proposals for planning and particularly for these platform production sites?<br><br>
I ask the hon. Gentleman, in all sincerity, to realise the danger of the loss of jobs such as those that Burmah Oil announced a few weeks ago, to consider the problems for the West of Scotland if it does not share in this kind of development and to appreciate the danger to our share in this technology if this building work is not done now.<br><br>
I have spoken this morning mainly about production platforms because these, more than anything else, focus our attention on the problem of planning procedures. This was the reason for Mr. Gordon Campbell's proposals at the end of January. Production platforms have highlighted the question of planning procedures, but many of us are equally concerned about planning procedures generally. However, I do not intend to develop that this morning.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 62</span>
Under the Conservative Government, there was an intention, which I hope that the present Government will carry on, to invest a great deal of money in improvements in communications, housing, education, and so on, in the areas where oil development is taking place. These intentions would have been backed up by finance. It became more and more apparent to me, as a constituency Member of Parliament—my responsibilities at the time in the Scottish Office did not cover this—that in my constituency in the North-East of Scotland no matter how good the Government's intentions—and I hope that the present Government's are equally good—many of these plans were delayed in coming into effect. Therefore, the benefits of the roads, the schools, and the houses, despite the Government's commitment to spend money on these things, will not be enjoyed for a considerable time because of delays of one sort or another in planning procedures.<br><br>
We must stand up for the rights of the individual to object and for the opportunity for full debate and consultation. All these are vitally important. We must achieve a better balance between, on the one hand, the rights of the individual and, on the other, other benefits for the community so that they come to fruition and are not frustrated by out-of-date planning procedures.<br><br>
Equally important is the ability, through planning procedures, to deal adequately with matters with a big expert and technical content. Production oil sites are one, refineries are another, and this will be a growing problem for Scotland. Nuclear power stations, which the hon. Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) mentioned last week, are yet another. We must look at our planning procedures to see whether they can cope with these issues.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One of the central problems is that whereas, for example, a big organisation such as the SSEB has a high-powered battery of lawyers at its disposal, others, who may have an equally good case but are relatively poorer, do not have that battery of legal expertise, and legal expertise may not be the proper basis on which to proceed to an equitable arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely the point that I have in mind, and I am
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0256">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 63</span>
grateful to the hon. Gentleman for emphasising it. On such matters, where expertise is required, it is very often the Government's decision whether it is that or another kind of development that is needed.<br><br>
Many of us welcomed the various interim planning papers that were produced by the previous Government on coastal planning, oil landing sites, and so on. I believe. that in the future, on issues such as this, the Government must take a more positive role. They must provide more positive identification of where these things are taking place.<br><br>
I believe that the papers that are being brought forward from the Scottish Office, instead of being in quite such general discussion paper terms, should be more positive. Perhaps the role of the planners in the Scottish Office should be built up into a more real and positive role of an advanced planning unit within the Scottish Office to try to deal with these technical matters, so that the public and those who live in these places know much more in advance precisely what issues are involved and what is likely to take place. I believe that that would help to avoid much of the confusion that exists.<br><br>
This is an important issue, and I hope that I have treated it constructively. I hope, too, that I have expressed the genuine desire in Scotland to share in the tremendous developments that are taking place. At the same time, I hope that, through speeding up our existing planning procedures, we can get over some of the difficulties that face us. I have put forward a number of points which I hope are constructive and positive. I trust that the Government will respond favourably, because people in Scotland look to politicians and to Parliament for a lead. I hope that we shall give a constructive and positive lead here this morning.</span></p>
<p>11.2 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Mr. Bruce Millan)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) indicated, the subject being debated this morning is important and covers a wide area. I wish that the debate could have extended over two mornings, in view of its importance. That, of course, is a matter for the Opposition, and perhaps even now they will consider it.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 64</span>
I cannot say that I agreed with every word of the hon. Gentleman's speech, but I found myself agreeing with a very substantial part of it. I particularly welcome the fair and constructive way in which he approached these difficult issues. I wish that he would convey some of that fairness and constructive approach to some of his right hon. Friends, for example, the ex-Minister of Energy, the right hon. Member for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Jenkin).<br><br>
I start with the general point made by the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns about the criticisms of planning procedures. These criticisms are contradictory, and they indicate that there is a conflict of interest in looking at planning procedures. On the one hand, the developer wants to get the most rapid decision about his application, while on the other the objector wants to see that his objections are properly and fully considered. There is an inevitable conflict of interest, and therefore it is not easy to see ways to improve our planning procedures which do justice to all the parties.<br><br>
Unless we abolish our planning procedures altogether, or unless we set them aside completely for, let us say, oil-related developments, there are bound to be difficulties in operating these procedures. Nevertheless, it is a mistake to argue, as a number of people have done over recent months, that the effect of our planning procedures in Scotland has been to delay very substantially and very damagingly applications for oil-related developments.<br><br>
When one looks at the record of what has happened over the past few years—and here one is dealing more than anything else with the previous Government's record—one sees that that is not the position. A large number of difficult substantial applications have been dealt with remarkably quickly. Perhaps I may mention some that were dealt with by the Secretary of State. The gas terminal at St. Fergus, was cleared in just over a month. The platform yard at Nigg Bay was cleared in a month. The platform site at Ardersier was cleared in two months. The oil support base at Stornoway was cleared in two months, and the oil terminal at Flotta was also cleared in two months. At local level, the platform yard at Methil was cleared by the planning authority in three weeks, and the detailed application was settled in three months.

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 65</span>
The ANDOC application at Burntisland was approved by the planning authority in two and a half months.<br><br>
I could quote other examples, but it is worth putting those on record as there is an impression abroad, particularly among those who have not studied these matters and among those outside Scotland, that every planning application in Scotland has been subject to interminable delay. Whether or not one thinks that they ought to be subject to delay, the fact is that it has not happened.<br><br>
When a particular planning application such as the Drumbuie one, involves difficult considerations of amenity and environment, when, as in that case, inalienable National Trust land is involved, and when the site itself is in a remote area of Scotland of considerable scenic beauty, there are bound to be difficulties. In my view, if the planning procedures are to mean anything at all, that kind of application cannot go through in a week or two. It is common ground, however, that where we can improve our planning procedures without irretrievably damaging the interests of objectors and amenity, and where it can help desirable developments to have decisions reached about them quickly, that ought to be done.<br><br>
I should like to give some indication of the action taken by the present Government and, indeed, of the previous Government on this matter. First, until recently there was no clear idea in the Scottish Office about the exact extent of oil-related applications for development in Scotland. We therefore issued a circular in May asking all planning authorities in Scotland to notify the Secretary of State of major oil-related applications as soon as they are received, and the information arriving as a result of that circular is now enabling us to build up a comprehensive picture of what is going on.<br><br>
Another important purpose of the circular was to emphasise to planning authorities the need to ensure that in considering planning applications they have before them all the necessary information to enable sensible decisions to be taken in the public interest. This has not always been so, as many applications have been put in, sometimes by reputable, large-scale firms, with very little in the way of back-up information, in particular with very little information about the impact that the particular development would have on the environment, where
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 66</span>
the labour was coining from, how the labour was to be accommodated, and so on.<br><br>
We want to stop all that from happening, and another purpose of the circular was to impress upon local authorities the need to obtain the maximum information from prospective developers. We are about to issue a technical advice note which will deal with some of these aspects of the matter in rather more detail than the general circular did.<br><br>
By way of interpolation, may I make a point about the restoration of sites. A point to which we attach considerable importance is that the planning authority should impose the conditions regarding the restoration of sites at the time of granting the planning application. It has not always been done in this way, but we have impressed upon local authorities the necessity to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Lawson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that it is one thing to impose a condition at the time of the application, but another to ensure that that condition is made operative? What methods has my hon. Friend in mind to ensure that the condition is made operative?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I said, Sir Myer, I wanted to deal with this only briefly, as I have many things to say. If my hon. Friend reads the report "Oil and the Environment" by the Oil Development Council he will see this matter dealt with at some considerable length. It is possible for financial arrangements to be made at the time of the planning application for the eventual restoration of the site, where that will be necessary. There is no reason why these financial guarantees should not be imposed right at the beginning.<br><br>
Quite apart from questions of planning procedure, there is the need to give general guidelines on planning and on the national situation so far as oil-related developments are concerned, and perhaps I may mention one or two points on this.<br><br>
First, the previous Government published last year a discussion paper on coastal planning framework. It was called "North Sea Oil and Gas—an Interim Coastal Planning Framework" and it is available to members of the Committee. We are now firming up this interim coastal planning framework, and the new document will be published during the summer—within about a month I hope.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0258">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 67</span>
Secondly, within the last month or so we have also published a paper on pipeline landfalls, which gives planning authorities guidance on the areas where pipeline terminals are most likely to be needed.<br><br>
Thirdly, we have recently set up a discussion group with representatives of the Faculty of Advocates, the haw Society, and the Scottish Committee of the Council on Tribunals to discuss possible means of speeding procedures at public inquiries and making them quicker, cheaper and more informal. Again, I hope for results from that within the next month or two.<br><br>
Fourthly, all this takes place against the need for a general background of policy on oil development generally. As the Committee knows, the Government are committed, before the House breaks up for the Summer Recess, to make a statement about major aspects of oil policy, including taxation, licensing, public participation, and so on. That statement will deal with the question of the rate of exploitation, and this in turn will determine the rate of demand for production platforms, about which the hon. Gentleman spoke this morning.<br><br>
Whatever the rate of exploitation, I agree wholeheartedly with the hon. Gentleman that it is very much in Scotland's interest that the supplies and equipment, particularly the oil production platforms, should be built in Scotland wherever possible. That is very much in Scotland's interest from the point of view of getting maximum development of Scottish industrial involvement. I take the justified criticism, made by local authorities and others, that so far there has been no overall statement of Government policy, either by the previous Government or so far by this Government, on oil production platforms, giving an estimate of the likely demand over the next few years—say up to 1980—on the orders that have been placed at present, on the sites available in Scotland and on what kind and what number of sites are likely to be required in Scotland over the next few years. That is a gap in our information at present. It was in relation to that that I spoke in the debate in the House, from which the hon. Gentleman quoted this morning.<br><br>
With regard to particular areas, we already have a report from consultants
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 68</span>
about the inner Clyde area, and that study has now been extended to the outer Clyde area. The report will be available in about a month's time and will provide us with very important additional information.<br><br>
Work on the general question of national demand for production platforms is proceeding rapidly, and again I hope that within the next month or so the Government—it is largely a Department of Energy responsibility—will publish a statement on the oil production platform position at present, the likely demand over the next few years and the likely impact on Scotland of the demand for sites.<br><br>
This is not a particularly easy operation, because it is not merely a question of one particular type of oil production platform that can he built at any one of a variety of sites. The physical characteristics of the North Sea oilfields demand several varieties of oil production platform, and these in turn demand certain physical characteristics on the onshore sites on which they can be built.<br><br>
The technology has changed considerably over the last year or so. The demand now is much more for concrete platforms than for steel production platforms as previously. The designs, too, are changing. There is a variety of designs on the market, and these demand certain physical characteristics on shore. It is a complicated problem, but I promise the Committee that: within, I hope, the next month there will he a statement of Government policy on the matter which will provide the planning background against which local authorities and others can decide the worth and merit of individual planning applications. We very much require this, and when we have that statement it will provide much useful information to authorities.<br><br>
Similarly, I hope that we shall soon have a statement from the Government about refinery policy which will determine the number of additional refineries that may he required in the United Kingdom over the years until 1980, and their characteristics. It will give the necessary background information which, in my view should have been provided long ago by the previous Government, and against that particular refinery applications—there is one at the moment which has caused controversy in Ross and Cromarty—can be judged. It will be useful background information.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0259">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 69</span>
It will be clear that the Government have already done a number of positive things to make the planning framework more coherent than it was until recently, and when the additional statements are produced we shall have gone a long way towards producing a coherent planning framework for Scotland as a whole.<br><br>
I want to turn briefly and finally to the question of legislation. As the hon. Gentleman has said, when we became the Government we inherited the situation that the previous Government had made a statement just before the election that they would introduce special planning legislation for oil-related developments. We objected to that at the time of the announcement, for the simple reason that it seemed to us that the legislation was designed to deal with one particular, extremely difficult planning application; namely, the one at Drumbuie.<br><br>
What the previous Government had in mind was to introduce legislation to abrogate the Drumbuie inquiry that was already taking place and to decide on the establishment of oil production platform installation at Drumbuie, regardless of the arguments that had already been put forward at the inquiry. We were not willing to proceed with the legislation on that basis, but even if we had been so willing the timetable that the previous Government had laid down for Drumbuie had already been lost, because of the General Election.<br><br>
The purpose of the previous Government's legislation was to allow the contractors to start at Drumbuie in June of this year. Even if the legislation had been introduced, and even if it had been desirable and merited and been put through the House as quickly as possible, the election killed the legislation in so far as it related to starting work at Drumbuie this summer. It became, therefore, largely irrelevant from that point of view.<br><br>
We said that the Drumbuie inquiry should take its course, and that has happened. The Reporter has published Part I of his report, which is the summary of evidence and the findings, and he is now preparing Part II. This matter is not within the Secretary of State's control, but it is true to say that the Reporter is well appraised of the wish of everyone on either side of the argument that he should make his report as rapidly as possible. I have no criticism to make of the Reporter
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 70</span>
from that point of view. He has produced the summary of evidence in Part I—it is a lengthy summary of extremely lengthy evidence—with remarkable speed, and I have no reason to think that he is not working with similar speed in the preparation of Part II of his report, which will give the recommendations.<br><br>
We should have that report within two or three weeks. I cannot say anything more precise than that, but I give a pledge that the Secretary of State will deal with that recommendation as rapidly as possible in the light of the extremely difficult considerations that are likely to have to be judged in making a decision on this matter.<br><br>
So far as legislation generally is concerned, as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Energy made clear in the debate in the House from which the hon. Gentleman quoted, and as I have made clear on numerous occasions since, particularly when meeting local authorities in Scotland, we have not said that there is not a case for legislation for the acquisition of sites and for closer Government control of oil-related developments in Scotland. We have said that this is a matter that we are considering—and this is true up until the present time—but we did not wish it to interfere in any way with the Drumbuie application. Decisions on whether there should be legislation and what the legislation should contain are matters which, I hope, we shall be able to clarify within the next month or so, but they are, to some extent, dependent upon the publication of the Drumbuie report.<br><br>
Whatever view one takes of the rate of exploitation of North Sea oil-and that is a matter which is basic to our considerations this morning, and on which I shall not argue at any length—in the present economic situation, and with our balance of payments position, there are strong arguments for getting substantial quantities of North Sea oil ashore as rapidly as possible, but to do that regardless of any kind of amenity, planning and environmental considerations, would give us problems for many years ahead which we would live to regret.<br><br>
Whatever view we take of the general question of the rate of exploitation, the fact remains that planning procedures have not, so far—with the exception of the Drumbuie inquiry which raises special considerations—held up to any significant degree the development of North Sea oil
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0260">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 71</span>
and the involvement of Scottish industry in the production of oil production platforms.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Lambie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give an equally sure guarantee that a decision on the planning application by Ayr County Council to develop Hunterston will be made with the degree of urgency that it appears the Secretary of State is to give to planning applications in the North of Scotland?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes.<br><br>
As I was saying, Sir Myer, I accept that there is considerable concern about the whole question of planning, but there is particular concern in Argyll. I should have been glad to deal with that if the hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. MacCormack) had been here this morning, but he is not. There is particular concern in areas such as Argyll which have recently been subject to a rash of planning applications.<br><br>
I have tried to show that a good deal has been done to get under control what is admittedly a difficult situation. I hope that within weeks, rather than months, when the new information and the new framework that I have mentioned are published, we shall have a coherent planning strategy against which these difficult planning applications, which balance very difficult problems of amenity on one side and development on the other, can be more accurately judged in the national interest. That will be very much welcomed by the local planning authorities and by everyone concerned with oil-related development in Scotland.</span></p>
<p>11.25 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. J. Grimond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must deal briefly, as the Minister did, with one point in the otherwise agreeable speech of the Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith). That is the immense pride he takes in that extraordinary proposal, cocked up by the late Government in their dying days. Suddenly they proposed to introduce the most drastic changes in planning procedures—two years too late. Again and again I went to his predecessor and said that the planning procedures must be altered, that the Scottish Office must take more
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 72</span>
interest in the general situation in the North of Scotland about oil-related industries and above all there must be a survey of suitable sites.<br><br>
All that the then Government did was to produce one extremely bad document about rig building—and I could give the details as to why it was so bad—which was rapidly pushed under the carpet. Two years passed, many inquiries were undertaken, thousands of pounds were spent, Private Bills were promoted in this place, and then the Conservative Government suddenly came forward with this proposal in their dying days. Three weeks after the new Government were in office Opposition Members began to ask why the new Government had not taken action on this, even though they had totally failed to take any action during the whole time they were in power.<br><br>
We know that the Conservatives change their policies rather rapidly. We accept that. bat even in these days in which coalitions are so popular, I do not think that they can now say that this was a wholly satisfactory procedure. In all seriousness, some inquest ought to be held as to how it happened, because it was not for lack of telling the Scottish Office that new planning procedures would be necessary. We never inquire in our parliamentary procedures why things go wrong. except occasionally financially. It would he worth seeing what went on inside the Scottish Office.<br><br>
I do not want to go again into the effect of oil upon my constituency because I have made many speeches upon it. I want to talk about planning. The most important thing is to give us the services. It is a serious situation. It is not only the impact on the community caused by the building of the camps and the vast incursion of labour from outside. There is a firm in Shetland which intends to put 40-ton cranes on the roads. The Shetland roads were never intended for loads remotely like those. The 17,000 people in the community are totally incapable of dealing with it from their own resources.<br><br>
There is still no doctor on Flotta. To take a service which has not yet been mentioned, this weekend a Minister has been in Scotland presenting bravery awards to coastguards. The extra work for the coastguards is considerable. I hope that the Government are looking at the standby vessels. Far from being of any assistance, the standby vessels require standby
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0261">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 73</span>
vessels themselves. There are all sorts of services in similar positions.<br><br>
I want to deal mainly with what happened in Shetland and Orkney when oil burst upon our happy community. As is known, both these communities had to promote Bills. First of all, they were far too expensive. We should look at the expense that Private Bills entail. There are only 17,000 people in each community, and goodness knows what they will have to find by way of expenses. It took up the entire time for many months of several county officials and of course of other people. I shall come to that.<br><br>
How are we to deal with the costs? Planning is a dripping roast for lawyers and architects. Twenty-two members of the Scottish Bar sat peacefully in Edinburgh for more than a fortnight. Good luck to them— so long as somebody else pays for them. Of course it is extremely unfair to the smaller people, the crofters, and so forth, who cannot possibly afford the legal representation and advice which the wealthier companies can muster.<br><br>
We must make it much more democratic. The Shetland County Council did its best to publish its proposals in advance. It is difficult to get people to take any notice of proposals until they actually hit them but, nevertheless, they must be published, and published in simple language. It is no good putting up notices saying "Under subsection (8) of Section 92 of some remote Act, heretofore and herethereafter" and so on. We need to tell people that their land is to he taken or their water used for something different, or whatever.<br><br>
Secondly, we must strengthen the hands of the local representatives. It would be far cheaper to increase the ombudsman approach than to brief all these lawyers with their juniors, their solicitors, the parliamentary agents and goodness knows what. We have got to look at how, in these technical matters, the democratic system can be made to work.<br><br>
The Minister said that some of this planning went fairly quickly. Some of it goes extremely slowly. T must tell him that there are several firms in Shetland which complain bitterly of the time it takes. I am told that in Norway, without taking away from the democratic process or the rights of individuals, they have managed to speed things up. I would ask the Government to look at that.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 74</span>
Of course the existing planning laws are not adequate. It is all very well for most of us to say that when planning permission is given there is an insistence on the thing being put back in good order. Some of us have rightly asked how this is done? The company may have gone out of existence. That is what quarry companies do, they wind themselves up when the quarry is closed. How does one get the pit put back in order? The only way is for the local authority to have some contractual right, either as a landlord or in some other way, and not to rely upon the planning procedures.<br><br>
Secondly, there are no planning procedures in the sea, as I keep pointing out. If you look at a map of the North Sea, Sir Myer, as no doubt you often do during those long mornings when you are not presiding in the Scottish Grand Committee, you will find that many of the best fishing grounds are already made impossible by the amount of debris and rubbish, wrecks and goodness knows what, apart from the areas which are too rocky to fish on. There is no control over this. Nobody in the fishing industry knows what damage is being done to the fishing grounds.<br><br>
There is inadequate control over the directions which the pipelines will take. The planning procedures in general stop, as far as I know, at low water mark. Again, that is quite inadequate.<br><br>
Further, there is the uncertainty. I do not suppose that anyone has followed the progress of the Orkney and Shetland Bills. The Shetland Bill came up at a time when there were some allegations in the Press about certain companies and there was a great deal of interest in the whole matter. Therefore, a lot of people pricked up their ears. There were considerable debates in the House and the hon. Member for Fife, East (Sir J. Gilmour) spent about three weeks sitting and listening and, no doubt, reading, because an enormous amount of paper was generated. He is a very public-spirited man, of equable temper and with a moderately safe seat—only moderately. But how many hon. Members can afford to give a month or more, almost full-time, to so very technical a matter? When the Bill returned to this House, one Member—Mr. Kinsey, who is no longer with us—took exception to a particular part of the Bill. He could have held up the Bill
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0262">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 75</span>
almost indefinitely, had we not managed to come to some sort of agreement with him to amend it. The Private Bill procedure is really most extraordinary.<br><br>
Contrast this with the Orkney Bill, with which there was no interference. It went through both Houses with hardly a murmur, and yet the issues were just as important. But it did not happen to arise a time when the House was interested. in this sort of thing. So it went through. This uncertainty is alarming in many ways, showing what can slip through this House and what may get held up.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir John Gilmour</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the right hon. Gentleman allow me one moment? I am grateful for what he said about my seat. One of the things which the Minister of State said was that one needed all the necessary information to help with planning. When the Shetland Bill was presented there was absolutely no information available whatsoever. The thing had to be drawn up by the authorities of the Shetland County Council completely in advance of any creditable information whatsoever.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grimond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very much obliged to the hon. Gentleman. That is perfectly true. There was no survey of the whole of the North of Scotland to discover what sites were suitable or available. There was no proper technical information available, and, of course, there is no proper servicing of these Committees—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lawson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As Chairman of the Committee on the Orkney Bill, it seemed to us. and certainly to the hon. Member for Fife, East (Sir J. Gilmour), that the Orkney County Council had done its homework. I thought that, more particularly, it had studied the report of the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs dealing with land use, and I thought that we had come to the conclusion that it had nearly completely applied the recommendations that we made then. So its passage was naturally much easier than the other.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think that we would like some order.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 76</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grimond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree. I think it is to the credit of the promoters of the Orkney Bill that they read the previous proceedings and tried to learn from what had been done. That is absolutely true. I know that the hon. Gentleman presided over that Committee with great skill and I am glad to hear that he found it satisfactory. But I think he would agree that it was lucky that the Shetland Bill had gone through first, because Orkney had the advantage of the experience of the previous Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the Member who objected the first time to the Shetland Bill on the Floor of the House may I say that it would not have occurred to me to do so had the requisite information been forthcoming from the previous Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grimond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to delay the Committee too long. It may have been noticed that not all of the time of my speech has been taken up by myself.<br><br>
There are many important aspects not related to planning at all. The most serious thing in Orkney and Shetland at the moment is the effect upon local industry. There is considerable disgruntlement growing up that everything is done for oil companies while local industries appear to be forgotten. Agriculture and fishing will be there long after oil has gone. There is sometimes a certain amount of resentment at what the oil companies can get done and what local industries cannot. Under the prices and incomes policy the oil companies can offer enormous sums and are draining away people all the time. It is not the right hon. Member for Bristol, South-East (Mr. Berm) who is having any effect upon local industry. The reason why the shops are closing there is that they cannot get assistants, because the prices and incomes policy takes no notice of local affairs. Look at the news today—1400 extra for working in London. I can assure the Committee that it is more expensive to work in Shetland than it is to work in London. It is this sort of effect on local industry that is not taken into account in planning.<br><br>
Again, too much planning is static. The last time I made a count there were seven firms drawing up plans for Shetland. They are beautifully bound. They are full of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0263">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 77</span>
statistics now—too late for the hon. Member for Fife, East, to make inquiries. They are very good in many ways, but they are totally static. They take a photograph of Shetland as it is now and from that they have tried to deduce what will happen in 20 years. The one thing that one knows with absolute certainty is that they will be wrong. Life does not stand still.<br><br>
Somewhere in the governmental machine—I am not sure at what level—we need some monitoring which will tell us the trends which are actually developing. I think the scale of planning is wrong. When one comes down to ground in Orkney and Shetland and looks at Flotta or Brae, one sees that the marvellous plans embracing the whole county do not lead to good architecture on the spot, to developing the Shetland or the Orkney way of life. When I am told that all these enormous operations on Flotta will be removed and the island will be landscaped, I wonder what on earth that means.<br><br>
Is it to be turned into a paragon of a public park? Are beds of geraniums to be laid out? In the meantime, all the top peat of Flotta has been taken off and flung into heaps and is totally useless. It is taken off in a way which makes it absolutely useless. That is a small matter, but it is indicative of the theoretical side of a great deal of planning which leaves out of account the human and the local side.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not actually disagree with many of the things which the right hon. Gentleman said, but I think it would be useful for the Committee if the right hon. Gentleman could tell us whether he is in favour of oil development in his constituency. Unless we know that, it is difficult to evaluate the points that he is making.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grimond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have said so many times: Yes, indeed I am, for the sake of us all so long as it is properly controlled and used. I have said that again and again. In fact, I am in favour of having it developed more quickly if the sources are available. But these are simple things. These are not complicated things. It is not complicated to provide a few more police. It is not complicated to employ a firm, not to make one static plan, but to keep an eye on the whole thing. I pay
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 78</span>
compliments, for instance, to the development staff in Orkney and Shetland who are doing just this. The officials in many cases are trying to do it. But what I do say is that we should learn from what happened, from the incredible slowness of the Scottish Office in getting on to oil at all, from the slowness of appointing anyone in charge, any Secretary of State for Energy, from the insufficiencies of some of the planning procedures to which everybody has drawn attention, and finally to those matters which are not in the planning procedures—the impact on local industry, on the local way of life, on crating and fishing.<br><br>
At the moment these are hardly even taken notice of in planning procedures. I am certainly in favour of oil. I hope it will bring great benefits to Orkney and Shetland—but only if it is controlled.<br><br>
Finally, a lot of attention has been paid to drilling rig building. A very half-cock suggestion about rig building was launched in Orkney, and it is a blessing that it never got any distance. I am told that Scott Lithgow is building ships which can drill, which obviates the whole question of damage to the environment. This is a changing matter, and to my mind, either in central Government or somewhere else, we need a monitoring unit, rather than a whole lot of static inquiries and statutory plans.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. May I appeal to hon. Members, in view of the number of hon. Members who are anxious to take part in this important debate, to try to make their speeches as brief as possible.</span></p>
<p>11.42 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Lambie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I realise that I was being unfair to my hon. Friend the Minister of State when I asked him to show the same sense of urgency when dealing with Hunterston as the Government appear now to show when dealing with other applications. From my experience of dealing with Ministers of State, especially at the Scottish Office, it is no use asking any Minister of State at the Scottish Office what is happening, because they do not know—just as I, an ordinary Member of the House, do not know. In fact, the only person who does know and who would give an answer is, unfortunately, not here today. I apologise to my hon. Friend for asking him that question.<br><br>

I should like to deal with a planning application with which I as a Member of Parliament have been concerned. In view of the Minister of State's statement today, that the Government are soon to publish a statement on refining policy, this is relevant to the debate. I refer to the history of Ayr County Council's application for planning permission to develop the Hunterston Peninsula. In looking into my lengthy correspondence on this matter, I came across an article by Gordon Campbell, who was then Shadow Secretary of State, published under the heading of "Scotland's natural resources" in the August/September, 1969, issue of the magazine <i>New Scotland</i>. He says:
<br><blockquote><p>"From the Opposition Benches in the House of Commons, Scottish Conservatives in recent weeks have been putting questions to the Government designed to draw attention to the significance of the Firth of Clyde as a source of new industrial acrivity and development. Then, on July 7th, we were able to arrange a debate in the House on this subject."</p></blockquote>
It is now 2nd July, 1974, and the Opposition have again very kindly arranged a debate on this document. In fact, it brings me more and more to realise the complete irrelevance of debate in the Chamber. We can get up, make our various speeches, making constituency points for the local paper, but at the end of the day it has no effect on the policy of a Labour or a Conservative Government. In fact, the sooner we leave this place and take the debate to where it would be relevant, in Edinburgh, the better it would be for Scottish Members of Parliament and for the Scottish people.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Teddy Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How can the hon. Gentleman say that after the sparkling debate we had on night storage heaters which led to a dramatic change in policy?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lambie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That also shows the irrelevance, not only of the Chamber, but of the hon. Member as well.<br><br>
We are now promised by the Minister of State today that the Government are to issue very soon, a memorandum from the Department of Energy on the future oil-refining policy of the United Kingdom. I think my hon. Friend was being very unfair to the Opposition when criticising their lack of activity over this during the period they were in power. He should
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 80</span>
realise that in December, 1970 the then Department of Trade and Industry submitted a memorandum to the Scottish Secretary of State, Mr. Gordon Campbell, on a similar topic. The point I am complaining about is that the Secretary of State for Scotland at that time did not take a decision on the memorandum that was produced.<br><br>
In June, 1969 Ayr County Council put forward proposals for a change of land use at Hunterston, to develop a deep-water oil terminal and refinery, steel mill, ore and general cargo terminals. After 42 days of a public inquiry under Mr. Henry Keith, Q.C., the final report was presented to the Secretary of State on 30th July, 1969. I can remember as a new Member of Parliament, in July, 1970, asking him when he was going to make a decision on the report of that public inquiry. The Secretary of State for Scotland has had this report—after one of the longest planning inquiries in the history of Scotland at that time—since 30th July, 1969.<br><br>
Four and a half months later, in December, 1970, the Secretary of State published interim decisions on the report from the public inquiry. He stated that very shortly a two-page memorandum would be circulated by the Department of Trade and Industry on refining policy within the United Kingdom. Two months later the Department of Trade and Industry published that memorandum. Because of the facts in that memorandum there was a further meeting held on 16th February, 1971, between all the parties concerned in the original public inquiry. It was agreed that there was the possibility of a new public inquiry being held in the first week in May. We have now been waiting since 1970. We are still waiting for a final result to the public inquiry that took place during 1969 and 1970. 1 put it to the Minister of State and to the hon. Members that it is not the procedures that are at fault, it is the Secretaries of State who have been at fault.<br><br>
Unfortunately we cannot blame the last Secretary of State for delay during the period 1970–74, but we can blame the present Secretary of State for continuing the policy of the previous Government and delaying a decision on this matter, in spite of the fact when in opposition in 1969 he was in favour of industrial development at Hunterston. From 1970 to 1974, when he
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0265">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 81</span>
had power to implement the industrialisation of Hunterston, however, he remained silent.<br><br>
The present Secretary of State, during the past 4½ years, went to STUC conference after STUC conference, to Labour Party conference after Labour Party conference, to Ayrshire Labour Federation conferences and stated clearly that he was in favour of the industrialisation of Hunterston. Yet we find that, now he is in power, he has not so far made a decision on this.<br><br>
This decision is vital as we are again approaching the campaign for another General Election. We do not know what the result will be. We could have a Conservative or a Labour Government in power, or a minority Government with the Nationalists holding the balance of power. We might have people, whether from the Labour, Tory or the Scottish National side, holding power and being able to prevent a decision on the industrialisation of Hunterston. I do not kid myself that the Scottish National Party is in favour of industrial development at Hunterston. Its spokesmen locally, its constituency party and its candidates throughout the Ayrshire area have come out against industrial development at Hunterston. This is one of the cases when the Scottish National Party speaks, not with one voice but with as many voices as there are constituencies in Scotland. Each has its own policy guaranteed to satisfy the local people.<br><br>
I therefore welcome the statement of the Minister of State that we will have a quick decision. The debate today reminds me of the story of the international concert pianist coming to a small town where he had been given the best piano available. It completely ruined his performance and he attempted to break it up. In this case we should not be breaking up the piano, we should be shooting the pianist. It is not the planning procedure that is at fault, it is the politicians who must reach decisions on the planning inquiries. Unless we have Government decisions to increase refining capacity in the United Kingdom, Scotland will not have any benefit from North Sea oil. I do not agree with the Minister of State. I agree with the Shadow Secretary of State, who thinks that to control the economic problems facing the United Kingdom we should extract oil from the North Sea as quickly as possible.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 82</span>
That might solve the financial problems of the United Kingdom, but it will not benefit the industrial people of Scotland whom I represent. I put it to the right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Grimond) and to Conservative members here who represent Highland constituencies that the day is past when the Highlanders, after being subsidised day after day by the people in industrial Scotland, can stand up and say that they will prevent the industrialisation of Scotland by halting tile exploitation of North Sea oil for, the benefit of the people of Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barry Henderson</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lambie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not at this point. I will take the advice of Sir Myer and finish on this point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to have that assurance from the hon. Member.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lambie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am putting this point as a Member representing over 80 per cent. of the people of industrial Scotland. If our economic future is to be secure we must have industrial sites in the Highlands of Scotland if these are the best sites available. They must be utilised whether the local people want them or not. The Scottish people in the mining areas of Central Scotland were not asked whether they wanted coal mines. But for the exploitation of coal in Central Scotland, Scotland would not have been an industrial country today.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would not have been an industrial slum either.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lambie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is all right coming from a person who spends most of his time in London.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. Will the hon. Gentleman give the fact upon which he makes that accusation? He is a damned liar.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is all very well. It is a pity we are not meeting in Edinburgh. I ask the hon. Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith) to withdraw that statement.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0266">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 83</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will withdraw the word 'liar' and say damned terminological inexactitude'.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lambie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the hon. Member. My point is that if we are to develop North Sea oil to its full potential for the benefit of the people of Scotland we must develop industrial sites in the Highlands of Scotland. Nothing gets my back up more than listening to radio and television reports of objectors from Highland areas and hearing the English accents. They are people who come up from England to retire in Scotland. They now claim the right—and some of my hon. Friends here even agree—to say that because they have decided to retire in the empty spaces of Scotland, they can prevent the Scottish people from having the full benefit of North Sea oil exploitation.<br><br>
If I were to listen to English people who want to prevent development in the North of Scotland I would not be representing my constituents in the central area of Scotland. The Highland constituencies must accept people from the industrialised areas setting up their industrial bases there to increase the wealth of Scotland. I have often said that the Sects people, unless there is a radical change in policy and outlook, will be like the Arabs—we will be among the richest people in the world thanks to natural oil resources, with the poorest population. The sooner we have Government decisions on these sites, and on increasing oil refining capacity in the Scottish area, the better it will be for the working people and the Labour Party of Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I again appeal to hon. Members to pay some attention to the number of Members who are anxious to take part in the debate.</span></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. T. G. D. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Sir Myer. I will not say what a deplorable speech the last one, by the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Lambie), was because of the time. I want to get on to the main aspect, which is the development of oil. The planning procedure is normally satisfactory, but the whole dimension has changed. No longer are we dealing with purely local problems. Great national issues become involved. This makes me
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 84</span>
wonder whether the public inquiry system designed for a one-off type of development—a local road, a garage at the bottom of the garden, or something like that—it suitable. If a developer fails at one poins he can always try again somewhere else.<br><br>
By sheer persistence he can wear down the energy of the objectors. The hon. Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) referred to it. The residents do not have the financial resources available to them. Large firms do. I suggest to the Government that, just as justice requires that legal aid be given so good planning requires that some financial help should be given to objectors so that they can cope with the expertise which the developers, with their big financial resources, can easily procure.<br><br>
Returning to the main problem, local planning authorities may take different views of the same type of development. We have had the hon. Gentleman speaking on behalf of Ayr County which wants an oil refinery at Hunterston, whereas I gather that at Ross there are doubts about whether there should be one at Nigg. I want to know what is in the national interest. There is apparently adequate refinery capacity in the country for our own needs. Do we as a nation wish to refine more oil than we need for our own consumption? This is a question which no local planning inquiry can begin to examine.<br><br>
If we are to have more refineries than we need for ourselves and are to despoil the countryside in the interests of providing oil for the rest of the world—we must remember that ours is a small country—should there be new refineries all over the place, or should existing refineries, such as that at Grangemouth, be increased? Consideration of these important permutations is quite beyond the competence of any local planning authority. The Minister says he will give some sort of guidance. I am glad to hear it. It is a help. I thought he made a good speech, balancing that of my hon. Friend the Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith). There were some aspects of my hon. Friend's speech with which I did not entirely agree.<br><br>
It is exactly the same when we come to the problems of constructing the platforms, about which everyone is agitated. We are told that only a few sites are suited for concrete construction. That may be true, but do we need to limit ourselves
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0267">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 85</span>
to concrete construction? Is concrete the method of the future or is it merely a temporary stopgap? Is it a technological aspect of the problem? Who will put forward arguments for and against that aspect?<br><br>
There is also, in any such development, the subject of beauty, which has been mentioned. There are plenty of spokesmen to put forward that point of view. I say to the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire that these not only include English people but Scotsmen, too.<br><br>
What about the social aspect to which the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Grimond) referred? What about the effect on the simple economy and way of life which is in the balance now? Very little would shatter it. We are always being asked: If Norway can build concrete platforms, why cannot Scotland? Where does Norway do it? At Stavanger, I gather, which already has a population of about 100,000. The introduction of the extra labour force does not make much difference to Stavanger. It can be accommodated in the area. In many parts of the Highlands the labour force that would be introduced is as big, if not bigger, than the whole of the local existing population.<br><br>
One must think of the imbalance it is bound to cause. It does so at a time when our industrial belt, already fully equipped with the men and the infrastructure of an industrial society, is crying out for new jobs. How can any local planning inquiry—I emphasise the word "local"—examine that aspect of the matter and decide, whether it is in the national interest to move people about the countryside, to destroy beauty, to build extra roads, schools and houses? They already exist in the central belt. How can a local planning authority deal with these aspects? The answer to the problem is not the old type of one-off planning inquiry, but a public inquiry commission, like the Roskill Commission which looked into the problem of a third London airport. We need something that can look at oil development in the context of the needs of the whole country, not simply Drumbuie. It would consider the need for cash, the balance of payments—the financial issues which may call for quick action. It would examine the needs of ordinary people from the industrial belt for the peace, beauty and quiet of the Highlands—somewhere where they can escape. That is the amenity aspect.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 86</span>
It would also consider the needs of the Highlands for some jobs, but not too many as to embarrass the community. That is the social aspect. As well as looking at these needs it would consider the opportunity for developing new and different methods of extracting oil at ever greater sea depths, and the spin-off that may result. That is the technological aspect. Instead of a series of local inquiries let us have a wide-ranging, public inquiry commission that can fully examine all the issues.<br><br>
When these have all been made public let the Government decide, not the Secretary of State or any other Minister who may have a particular interest, taking into account the conflicting interests and issues in the best long-term—I emphasise the point—interests of the whole country. If we could do that, we could take much heat out of the present situation and bring some clarity and sureness where there is now a great deal of uncertainty and frustration.</span></p>
<p>12.07 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Baxter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with much of what the hon. Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith) has said on this important subject. The long-term issue is of paramount importance to the well-being, not only of Scotland, but the whole of the United Kingdom. I must confess, however, that the two Front Bench speeches left much to be desired. From neither did we have a clear indication of a policy which this country could pursue in future. We have had a great deal of talk about planning. On the one side the Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) seemed to say that the present planning laws were not sufficient to meet the requirements, and it was necessary to introduce a new measure to overcome difficulties of planning.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Minister of State, while agreeing with much that the hon. Member for Angus and Mearns said, seemed to contradict everything by stating categorically that the planning of those schemes put before the Scottish Office was in no way delayed, but could be decided upon very quickly. He enumerated a number of the schemes that his Department had dealt with.<br><br>
As I see it, the question of the exploitation of oil is not only a matter for Scotland or the United Kingdom. It is a matter
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0268">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 87</span>
for the whole of the civilised world. I had occasion within the last three weeks to go to the McMurray Oil Sands in Canada. There one sees oil sands being worked on the open-cast principle. These are sands that hold oil with an estimated barrelage more than all the oil that has been found in the Middle East, Scotland or throughout the known world with the exception of the Communist states. The deposits of oil in the McMurray Sands are greater than all other known deposits throughout the world.<br><br>
But are they doing what we are proposing to do—exploit them hurriedly and indiscriminately—or are they planning for the future instead of being concerned only with the present? The great tragedy, as I see it, that is being enacted in this country is this unseemly hurry to get to the North Sea oil, to make us rich as quickly as possible, so that we do not need to depend upon the scientific, technological and engineering ingenuity that has stood us in good stead in the past and made us a great industrial nation.<br><br>
We seem to feel that this is the easy way out of the difficulties we face with the balance of payments, which my hon. Friend mentioned and which we all agree are very difficult to overcome. It would be to the discredit of Scotland and Scotsmen if we chose this way out of the difficulties besetting our country now. It is up to us to look upon oil as a benefit that has been conferred upon us by no right that I can see. It is a bonus which should be cherished and nurtured, and used not for our own personal greed or gratification but for the well-being of future generations.<br><br>
I agree with the hon. Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith) that there is a need for a commission of inquiry even at this late hour in the day—even if it is a commission of inquiry of hon. Members on both sides of the House and other minor parties—to consider how the oil should be exploited and how it should be phased over a lengthy period of time.<br><br>
We are told that from the Scottish point of view this is Scottish oil. Indeed it is Scottish oil under international law, but we have been told by the present and the previous Governments that it is British oil. If we are part of the United Kingdom and remain so, it will be British oil under international law. But we are
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 88</span>
now told that it is not British oil, that it is Common Market oil, and if our adherence to the Rome Treaty is continued it is indeed Common Market oil. But look at the contradiction in terms. The United Kingdom Government condemn my friends and colleagues in the Scottish Nationalist Party for saying that it is Scottish oil. The Europeans condemn Britain for saying that it is British oil. If one boils the whole thing down, the oil does not belong to Scotland, Britain or the Common Market. These great mineral resources of the world, produced not by our efforts but by a higher authority, be it gold, silver, copper or anything else. They should be the property of an international authority using what has been discovered for the benefit not of one group of people, be they Scots, British or European, but for the benefit of the human race.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Russell Fairgrieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What is the hon. Member's authority for saying that it is Common Market oil? Who said it, where and when?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think that the hon. Member has gone too far. We are not discussing the ownership of oil, and. I cannot allow further discussion on that. May I remind the hon. Member again to be brief, because I have one or two other speakers to call.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Baxter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I respect your point of view, Sir Myer. I do not address this Committee often, and I have spoken for less than five minutes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member has already spoken for 15 minutes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Baxter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Committee, but the Front Bench speakers took half an hour to propound their theories. One of the most important subjects that could be discussed in the House of Commons warrants a great deal more time than has been devoted to it. I shall certainly cut my remarks short for the benefit of you, Sir Myer, and other Members of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is not for my benefit. It makes no difference to me whatsoever. I am interested and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0269">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 89</span>
anxious that as many hon. Members as possible should be able to take part in the debate and that hon. Members should show some respect for those who do wish to take part.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Baxter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise if I have in any way offended the Chair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Donald Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order Sir Myer. In view of the remarks you made about the desire of several other Members to join the debate, is there any possibility of continuing the debate on some day next week?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a matter not for me, but for the usual channels. I see no practical difficulty in the debate being continued, but if hon. Members would show some respect we could deal with these Votes this morning without difficulty.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Baxter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise if I have taken too long. I did not think I had really taken very long and I shall bring my remarks to a close. As I have already said, certain things have been said on both sides of the Committee that warrant some considered reply. I could answer the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Fairgrieve) who asked whether this was Common Market oil, but if he does not read the papers or study what is going on, that is his concern. I do not want to elaborate on that.<br><br>
As I have already said, the exploitation of this oil can bring great benefits to the people of Scotland and Britain. The fact of the matter, as the right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Grimond) said, is that great damage can accrue not only to the beauty of Scotland but to the fishing, which is extremely important and should be looked at with greater care.<br><br>
I deprecate the sentiments of my hon. Friend the Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Lambie) who takes the attitude that we should ride roughshod over the opinions of people in the Highlands. If I may say so, very few people there are English, and even if they are English, what fault is that? Many ordinary people, have lived there for centuries, notwithstanding the Clearances of a bygone day and age; Clearances that were based upon the same mental outlook as my hon. Friend has indicated this morning—"Damn the consequences, the Small
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 90</span>
man must be cast aside because profit and our advancement as individuals are the important things in life." I disagree with that profoundly.<br><br>
Our duty and, I believe, our responsibility, not only in the Committee this morning but as good citizens of Scotland, is to see that irreparable damage is not done to its natural beauty and that its economic survival is not endangered. This is the danger if one becomes too dependent upon the easy life, the easy way, and this is the easy way to balance our payments.<br><br>
I humbly say that to debate such an important subject for two and a half hours is a disgrace to our country. It makes it all the more important that a Parliament should be established with control over the affairs of our nation which is not dictated to in the manner in which we are being dictated to in this establishment. Shame upon us all—Tory, Labour, Liberal, Scottish Nationalist, or whatever—that we accept this way of discussing the most important question that has faced Scotland since before the Industrial Revolution.</span></p>
<p>12.20 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am beginning to feel rather like the Galloping Gourmet, in the sense of having to get through a speech in a very short period of time. First, I associate myself with those who have indicated their disapproval of the short period of time which has been placed at the disposal of the Committee for such an important discussion. The second criticism I would make is of the lack of notice that was given of the subject matter. I have not yet been given a detailed notice of it, the notice of meeting bearing only a reference to the Scottish Estimates. I hope that the procedures of the Committee will be improved for the benefit of those Members of it who are not members of the larger parties.<br><br>
In relation to oil, and touching upon what the Minister of State said, the real problem of crisis facing the planning procedures comes from the major decisions on planning which have been taken, not in relation to specific proposals, but in relation to the decision to expand production at the greatest possible rate. That is the touchstone of everything that has been happening in Scotland. To refer to what has happened, I would say that it resembles the Miltonian version of Hell,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0270">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 91</span>
with the extremes of heat and cold. Some parts of the country are being exposed to extremes of heat, or overdevelopment, and others, badly in need of development, are receiving nothing from the development of the Scottish offshore oil resources.<br><br>
Therefore we come back to the decision to expand the programmes of exploration and production. The more activity there is in this sphere, the more difficulties there will be in the body politic of Scotland. The Forties Field alone provides sufficient oil to keep Scottish needs supplied until the end of the century, yet already we have ten major oilfields in the course of development. Anybody who looks at the IMEG report will see that the estimate is given of four years of maximum capital expenditure to bring each oilfield into production. Even if we allow a slippage in the timescale for the difficult conditions of the North Sea, one may still suggest a period of six years of maximum capital expenditure. If there are ten oilfields, all being developed at the same time, there will be pressures which nobody could have expected. That is the problem. It is a blunder of the first magnitude in macro-planning that this was allowed to go ahead.<br><br>
The rush to develop the oil "bolus bolus" is introducing us to the difficult situations which have been described by individual Members, affecting their own constituencies. A child might have seen this coming. Unfortunately, successive Governments have not.<br><br>
One can see the effects of this already in the question of platform sites. In Scotland we have four platform sites in production at present, and there is also one in England, yet it has been suggested that we have upwards of 20 platform sites in Scotland. This would postulate a 5 to 15-year life span for each construction yard. This is one of the dangers which has been referred to by the hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. MacCormick), since his constituency has a large number of applications before the planning committee for developments in that one area. Yet this can have an effect not only on the life span of particular production platform yards, but also on other industries associated with them.<br><br>
One of the effects of building up quickly in new industries of this sort is that one finds that certain categories of workers are in demand, principally steel workers and welders. One can have an accelerated
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 92</span>
programme for training and for recruitment from people who are unemployed. But if there are pressures of development, one will find that recruitment steps will be taken to bring in people from existing industries. In my own constituency, the shipyard of Robb Caledon is already beginning to complain about the shortage of steel workers caused by the loss of these workers to the oil industry far from Dundee. This may well cause considerable structural problems to the yard which is doing very well at present, but which may find itself crippled by the absence of key workers. This is something that must also be borne in mind.<br><br>
If one naturally assumes that an extension of development in oil-rig construction yards would lead to a reduction in unemployment, as it would to a certain degree, one cannot accept that it would make all that great impact, because these firms prefer people who are already trained, if they can get them, and they are prepared to pay accordingly. That may mean that there will be no immediate or great effect on the large pool of unemployed in Scotland, particularly since that pool exists in areas where the construction activity does not extend.<br><br>
T should like to refer to one subject which has not so far been mentioned; it is almost a question of economic planning as opposed to planning procedures, I think that greater importance should be placed by Her Majesty's Government on the development of the oil tools industry. It is agreed that platform construction can play a useful part in building up Scotland, but if one wants to take full benefit of the offshore oil industry, I hope that considerable effort will be made by the Government to attract industries from outside Scotland which specialise in oil tools, particularly if they can be persuaded to enter into partnership agreements or association with existing Scottish industry. I think that would be welcomed by many places where there is manufacturing potential, and where there are accrued skills in light engineering.<br><br>
There is another thing that has not been mentioned, but should be, in relation to planning procedures and the acceptance of certain types of industrial activity. There is often a tendency in certain areas to say, "If we do not take this huge enterprise that is coming our way, that will be the only opportunity that we will get", on the basis that as the area has
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0271">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 93</span>
been left derelict for years there is no hope unless it accepts whatever opportunities come its way. It may be that in taking that attitude an area might accept an industry that could destroy a local community and its way of life. I should like to see that the oil revenues which will be received—one would hope from this autumn, as soon as the oil begins to flow—will be available to the local communities which are affected, and will be used for bringing in new industrial opportunities, which may in themselves have nothing to do with the oil industry. I should like the Government to pay much more attention to that aspect.<br><br>
Again, on the question of oil refineries, I was very much disturbed that responsibility for these lies primarily with the Secretary of State for Energy. I know that the Secretary of State for Energy has conceded that the Scottish Office will be consulted. But where it is a question of economic planning within Scotland, where it is a question that refineries could be authorised on a certain scale, I think that the primary decision should lie not with the Secretary of State for Energy, but with the Secretary of State for Scotland. It should come within the scope of his Department, and I hope that the Department will fight for that responsibility.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It does.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I put down a Question to the Secretary of State for Scotland on the need for a refinery policy for Scotland, and the Question was transferred from the Scottish Office to the Secretary of State for Energy. That action speaks for itself, I would suggest.<br><br>
Again, in relation to planning procedures, it is generally agreed that something ought to be done to make improvements. The inquiry system can take too long but I think some of the responsibility can also rest with the Scottish Office for the amount of time that it takes to come to decisions. I am not necessarily making that a criticism solely against this administration. I think it is a criticism that could have been made against successive administrations.<br><br>
One has to balance the need for consultation and the need for individuals to be represented. When it comes to the question of objectors having a say, some
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 94</span>
effort should be made by Government to provide financial aid for them because the scale of expenditure in these matters is so great that any person without the tools of the trade available to him is placed in an invidious situation. I ask the Government to give consideration to this proposal.<br><br>
But I reiterate that it is the decision of the previous administration to go ahead with oil development at all costs to safeguard the British balance of payments that is putting pressures on society in Scotland. I ask Her Majesty's Government, when they prepare their oil policy proposals, to do something to slow down the whole business and to give Scotland and Scottish industry the chance to benefit.</span></p>
<p><i>Several hon. Members rose.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I call the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Sproat).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamish Gray</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Myer. I represent in this Committee the constituency with the greatest oil interest. I have sat here throughout the debate, and I have not been able to contribute to it. There are a number of very important things that I want to say, and I think we have experienced excess verbosity from certain Members from Central Scotland, one of whom does not know the slightest thing about the area concerned, but who took up a great deal of our time. The hon. Member may know all about the sultans from Saltcoats, but he does not know very much about the Highlands of Scotland. I think it quite wrong that the Member for a constituency of the importance of Ross and Cromarty should not have the opportunity of taking part in a debate on a subject of this nature.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think hon. Members will appreciate that it is the duty of the Chair to regulate individual Members who take part in the debate. One tries to get a balanced point of view from the respective political parties and from the various areas. I appreciate what the hon. Member has said, but the debate has to finish at One o'clock and I was advised that the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Sproat) wanted to start his speech at half past Twelve. If we are to depart from that arrangement
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0272">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 95</span>
I shall have no objection whatsoever. It will make no difference to me, except that at One o'clock I shall adjourn the debate. If the Committee is to continue on Thursday, that is not a matter for the Chair. Hon. Members must make their own decision on that matter. Are we going on with the debate, or are we winding it up today? This is the whole point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You are looking to me, Sir Myer, but may I say, with respect, that the question of subjects for Estimate days is not one for the Government. The subjects are chosen by the Opposition. I am simply dealing with the subject that they have chosen. I have made my view clear at the beginning and I have no strong feeling one way or the other. It is not a matter for me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order. Reference was made by two speakers to the absence of my hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. MacCormick). I accept they did not make that in any nasty way, but had lie known the subject of the debate today and that his constituency would be concerned—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is hardly a point of order. Every Member of the Scottish Grand Committee has a duty to attend irrespective of whether he has a knowledge of the debate. If he is absent it is not my fault. Mr. Sproat.</span></p>
<p>12.34 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sproat</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One of the most useful things that has come out of this debate this morning, which was particularly well brought out by the right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Grimond), is the extraordinary gap between the magnitude of the opportunity that is presenting itself to this country in terms of off-shore oil resources, and the so far still inadequate response of Government to this opportunity. Here we have a natural resource that is greater than anything we have ever known in this country.<br><br>
In terms of the Government's latest production figures alone, we are talking about £3,250 million by the end of this
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 96</span>
decade and within another five years of that, perhaps £4,200 million. These are very cautious estimates and they do not even take into account platform building and other aspects of oil-related marine engineering, servicing and so on. We are talking of an industry that will save our balance of payments, we hope, by the end of this decade the sum of £2,800 million. Yet in spite of these figures, in spite of the fact that everybody on both sides of the Committee—with perhaps one or two exceptions—is prepared to pay lip service to this whole concept, we still have not had—though there have been some indications from the Minister of State this morning—in terms of action as opposed to speeches, the sense of drive, of urgency and of guidance, which the country desperately needs.<br><br>
Nowhere is this lack of drive, urgency, guidance and priority generally more apparent than in planning. My hon. Friend the Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) mentioned Drumbuie. Had I time, I should certainly like to mention the question of Aberdeen Harbour. For almost a year this has been held up for 24-hour operational work. It is almost incredible in a port which is the single most important port in our oil activities. I warn the Government that if these delays, for which I am not wholly blaming them, continue we shall not reach North Sea self-sufficiency by 1980, or anything like it.<br><br>
Vital as is Loch Carron, and Aberdeen Harbour in its different way, I want to turn to what I regard as the most disastrous example of all, in delay and omission, in the planning and development of offshore oil; namely, the failure of both the present and the previous Government to give any adequate lead or guidance on the establishment of United Kingdom, and within that Scottish, objectives and strategy. It is no use the Government's complaining, either implicitly or openly, that local authorities, perhaps Ross and Cromarty, are making a mess of things, if the Government themselves do not give a lead on what they consider to be the proper balance between economic, social and environmental objectives. The Government should now say clearly, and even bluntly, that the overriding national interest of Scotland and the United Kingdom requires the quickest maximisation of revenue to the Treasury, certainly up to self-sufficiency of North Sea oil.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0273">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 97</span>
No doubt we shall hear from the Department of Energy within a month what it thinks about North Sea oil.<br><br>
We require the maximisation of savings in the balance of payments, the maximum participation of British companies in the exploration, extraction, servicing and refining of offshore oil, and the maximum Government help in creating the technological expertise in Scotland that can continue to be of value when applied to offshore oil locations anywhere in the world both during and after the development of our own resources.<br><br>
At the same time that the Government make these national and overriding objectives of their strategy clear, they should admit openly that these objectives are attainable, unfortunately and unavoidably, only with considerable local disruption, large incoming labour forces in certain areas, problems of suddenly soaring and possibly equally suddenly declining wage rates, problems of comparative wage rates for existing industries, housing shortages, house price rises for the indigenous population, huge financial burdens on local authorities, which at the moment they are just not capable of meeting, and the marring of areas of great natural beauty. The Government must show themselves to he fully aware of all these local problems but, none the less fully determined to stick to their national priorities.<br><br>
I want to suggest three specific points to help achieve these objectives. The first, about which there is much agreement already in Scotland, is the urgent need for a national plan of designated sites suitable for oil development. This coordinated strategy plan must make clear how many sites are needed and where, in the best estimate of the Government, fabrication yards, servicing centres, refineries and possible downstream petrochemical developments should go.<br><br>
Such a plan will doubtless later have to be amended, but better such a plan and such guidance than no plan and no guidance. The plan should make clear to the oil-related industries where they can expect immediate approval for development; it should make clear to the financially-burdened local authorities areas for what infrastructure development they can expect assistance from the Government, whether in the form of bridging finance or whatever; and it should also make clear to conservationists that the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 98</span>
Government, by containing development to certain areas, are determined to avoid environmentally destructive industrial proliferation.<br><br>
The Government have promised a coastal sites document in August, as the Minister of State confirmed today, and it will not come a day too soon. The greatest single need in this field is for a general strategy plan of oil development to put an end to the growing frustration and uncertainty presently felt by industry, local authorities and everyone in Scotland who fears the result of over-hasty, ill-considered, <i>ad hoc</i>x planning.<br><br>
My second point is that the industry developing a local site must be compelled, through planning permission procedures, to make a direct and specific contribution to the extra financial burdens which its development imposes on the community. By that I mean something in addition to anything that the Government may give—although what the Government give will come out of extra revenue accruing to the Treasury from corporation or other taxes levied on the oil industry.<br><br>
Nonetheless, it must be incumbent upon incoming industry and on the local authorities to work out a far more precisely quantified approach than before to the extra requirements for houses, roads, education and general welfare facilities, water supplies, drainage, communications, and so on. There must be a precisely quantified approach by the local authority and by the incoming companies.<br><br>
Such calculations are obviously much easier to do with industry coming into places such as Drumbuie rather than into Aberdeen. Nevertheless, much of the extra burden on local authorities' finances will in many cases—in some communities in most cases—be clearly seen to be attributable to the incoming industry. Where it is so attributable, the Government should lay down guidelines as to how the incoming industry should contribute to the local communities. Otherwise, local communities will be convinced that they are being exploited in the short term and left with social and environmental desecration in the long term. We must not allow that.<br><br>
Thirdly, it must be made compulsory, through planning procedures, for incoming industry and the local authorities to agree on what will happen to sites after
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0274">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 99</span>
the industry has gone. This was mentioned earlier today, and it is absolutely vital. What happens after the industry has gone will vary from site to site. It is essential that the post-development use of the site should be planned and agreed before the site is developed. It may be that industry should be compelled, with suitable insurance in cases of bankruptcy, and so on, to guarantee restoration of the landscape. It may be that it should have to guarantee restoration plus certain amenities, such as marinas or holiday homes, as they are doing at Stavanger. Whatever is wanted, the vital point is that the local community must have the right to know in advance what it is proposed should happen afterwards and that this is built into the development plan.<br><br>
To those three main points it is essential to link a number of further factors. First, the Government must spell out at the earliest opportunity how they will help local authorities to bear these extra burdens which increased infrastructure has placed upon them. No doubt if my hon. Friend the Member for Ross and Cromarty (Mr. Gray) had caught your eye earlier, Sir Myer, he would have pointed out that Ross and Cromarty is facing an extra 55,000 people coming in and that Shetland is having 12,000 added on to its present community of about 17,000.<br><br>
Secondly, I should like to see the Government working out an overall strategy with the universities, the technical colleges, the oil companies and schools on exactly how we will ensure the maximum stake for Scotland in present and future oil technology expertise.<br><br>
Thirdly, and I am sure that this will appeal to my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith), the Government must work out how they can best maximise the participation of Clyde-side's engineering industry in the oil development programme. This must be done in such a way that it does not direct financial aid to propping up West Central Scotland at the expense of making the absolute political priority the injection of vast capital sums into the areas such as the North and North-East where the real growth and success must be reinforced.<br><br>
Fourthly, there must be far better liaison between Government Departments. The Aberdeen Harbour question, which I
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 100</span>
mentioned, is a disgraceful example of bad liaison between the Department of the Environment, the National Ports Council and the Treasury. We must have more efficient and quicker liaison.<br><br>
Lastly, I would mention that while most people would agree that in principle the balance is fairly well struck between the rights of the individual to object and those of applicants to put forward their ideas, much could be improved within the present framework. I am glad to know that the Government are looking at this. There is no doubt that inquiries tend to be too long, too legalistic—not the nine major ones which the Minister of State quite fairly mentioned, but there are others, as the right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Grimond) mentioned—and too costly.<br><br>
I think that we could introduce far more written submissions, and it may be possible to lay down certain rules about the total time scale, to cut out filibustering, and so on. With regard to "too legalistic", I think that we should think of a fresh way of dealing with expert evidence, which I do not think is best handled by the rather forensic techniques employed.<br><br>
As regards the third problem, I agree with those who say, as the hon. Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell), does, that something must be done to meet the costs of objectors. We cannot have a situation in which people are afraid to put forward what is undoubtedly in the public interest lest in so doing they bankrupt themselves. I suggest that objectors' expenses should be paid where, possibly on the recommendation of the Reporter, those objections are shown not to be frivolous and, indeed, to be in the public interest.<br><br>
I conclude by returning to what I regard as the single most important point in our oil development programme, and that is the need for the Government to produce an overall United Kingdom and Scottish strategy, so that the whole country can receive the maximum benefit from offshore oil.</span></p>
<p>12.46 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With the permission of the Committee, I should like to speak again.<br><br>
May I start with two personal references. First, may I congratulate the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Sproat) on the first occasion that he has spoken from the Front Bench opposite. If I may say so,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0275">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 101</span>
the hon. Gentleman made a very constructive speech, and I hope to take up one or two points that he made. He distributed the blame between the previous and present Governments, and that made his speech all the more agreeable.<br><br>
Secondly, may I make a personal reference to the hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. MacCormick), because the hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Stewart) specifically mentioned him. I had a meeting with the Argyll County Council on 14th June to discuss the serious problems that it has in dealing with planning applications. The hon. Member for Argyll was invited to that meeting but he did not come to the meeting—no doubt he had something else to do that day. I think that the hon. Gentleman was giving away the prizes at the Glasgow High School, but the fact is that he was invited to the meeting and he did not come.<br><br>
Nor has the hon. Gentleman attended the Committee this morning, but he has made many speeches outside. He has asked to see me and my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Energy. I am seeing the hon. Gentleman tomorrow afternoon to talk about the problems of Argyll. I shall be delighted to do that, but I should prefer to see the hon. Gentleman attending this Committee when these matters are under consideration.<br><br>
May I first say something about overall policy. I agree with what the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South said about the need for overall Government policy in this whole area of oil development, but that is a criticism which, if I may say so, is much better directed towards his Government than towards the Labour Government. Many of us, over considerable periods of time, asked the previous Government for statements of overall policy on every aspect of oil development, but we never received them. The present Government are committed—and this is after four months in government and after inheriting a situation which was largely determined by decisions taken by the previous Government and which we could not influence—to providing before the Summer Recess an overall statement on all the important aspects of oil policy— licensing, taxation, public participation, the involvement of British industry, environmental considerations, and so on.<br><br>
I do not think that the charge that has been made can be sustained against the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 102</span>
present Government. It is true—and I admitted this in my opening remarks—that, in the absence of this overall view of planning, local planning authorities are put into considerable difficulty. I have never denied that. I do not deny it this morning, and I have not denied it when I have met the local authorities, either individually or collectively. It is for that reason that we are as anxious as they are that the additional information which provides the kind of coherent planning framework that I talked about earlier should be made available as soon as possible.<br><br>
I believe that the identifiable gaps in that are the statement on oil production platform sites, and also the statement on refinery policy. These, as I said earlier, I have promised very soon indeed. When we get these statements, the position then will not be that everything will be straightforward from the point of view of local planning authority. I should not claim that. There will still be difficult decisions to make, but at least they will be made with rather more coherent information about Government policy and about the national interest than we have had so far.<br><br>
A number of points have been made about particular aspects of our planning procedures, and perhaps I could deal with one or two of these. The right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Grimond) drew attention to the fact that his local authorities were forced by the previous Government into introducing their own legislation because of a lack of overall policy. If we had had the necessary legislation two years ago, I think that a lot of current difficulties would have been avoided.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman knows that the present Government gave every assistance on both the Bills in which his authorities were interested. We inherited a situation in which there was no overall legislation, where two local Bills were going through Parliament, and where we had an extremely difficult Drumbuie inquiry. These were the worst circumstances in which immediately to go into overall Government legislation, but I hope that we shall announce our decision on this very soon.<br><br>
It is very relevant to the matters which the right hon. Gentleman mentioned, such as the control of offshore activity which is not at present subject to normal planning legislation. The Ross and Cromarty County Council, as the hon. Member for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0276">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 103</span>
Ross and Cromarty (Mr. Gray) will know, is considering promoting a Private Bill to deal with the problems that arc likely to arise in the Loch Carron area. It is relevant to questions of the control of pipelines, which again will be included in the statements that will be made, I hope before the Summer Recess. And it is, of course, relevant to the restoration of sites, and so on. I do not disagree with those who have said that there are deficiencies in our arrangements on these matters. These deficiencies were inherited, and we hope to put them right very soon.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making far too much of the difficult situation that he inherited. I should like him to take account of two things. First, it is only just over two years—and the right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Grimond) might take note of this as well—since oil was first established in commercial quantity. That is the time scale of which we are speaking. Secondly—and I am sure the hon. Gentleman wants to be fair—the Minister must admit to the Committee that he inherited a great deal of sound, solid work on these matters from the previous Government. I do not minimise the difficulties, but I should ask him to pay some tribute to the considerable amount of work that has gone on in the short period since oil was first found.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not deny in my opening speech this morning that work had gone on. I specifically mentioned and paid a tribute to the interim coastal planning survey which, within its limits—and it was recognised at the time that it had limits—was an admirable document, and we are founding on that. But the fact still remains that not only in planning but in the whole business of licensing, taxation, and so on, there was a lack of Government coherence and control of the oil situation in Scotland. If one compares what happened in Scotland with what happened in the Norwegian situation, one can see how much we have suffered, and are suffering now, from the lack of overall Government direction and control over a sustained period under the previous Government. This is not being wise after the event, because all these points were made to the former Secretary of State for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 104</span>
Scotland and to former Ministers, first at the Department of Trade and Industry and then at the Department of Energy.<br><br>
On the planning matters, I have taken note of many of the points that were made this morning, and some are under consideration by the Government. I hope we shall not believe that there is some kind of overall procedure to solve these problems, whether a planning inquiry commission dealing with a particular area, or some kind of planning inquiry commission for the whole of Scotland as recommended by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith). I do not think that that is the way to tackle this problem. Even if it were, it would place a complete moratorium of anything up to two years on all development whatsoever. That is impracticable in the present situation.<br><br>
I am not one who believes that every time an oil development company or production platform company thinks that it has a design which will sell and it needs a site and it puts in any kind of hamfisted application for a site that, whatever the circumstances, it should get immediate attention and immediately have its wishes granted. That completely ignores the realities of the environment, the realities of infrastructure, the realities of the local population, and so on. All these matters have to be taken into account.<br><br>
Neither do I believe that when one gets an application from a company which has a design which is liable to be ordered and which can provide a lot of additional employment for the people in Scotland, particularly if it is in an area which can draw people from the central belt of Scotland for employment, one can say simply that time does not matter and we can go through a long and elaborate procedure, and only when we have considered the whole of Scotland in every last particular and detail can we give a decision on that. It is that kind of balance that we must draw.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lawson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for raising this matter again, but my hon. Friend might keep in mind that a substantial number of his hon. Friends and hon. Members opposite spent about 18 months looking into this subject. We produced a report on land use in Scotland which has a great deal of relevance to the matters that are now being discussed. I hope that he and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0277">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 105</span>
the Government will pay some attention to that report, and perhaps find an opportunity for us to discuss it, but also show us that we are applying some of the recommendations made in the report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Milan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take my hon. Friend's point. I do not think it detracts from or contradicts anything that I have said this morning. The point that I was making was that neither can we give the developer everything that he wants immediately, nor can we halt the process completely. It is in that context that planning applications and planning inquiries have to be considered. As I said earlier, I am not satisfied that the planning inquiry procedure is perfect for our present circumstances. That does not apply solely to oil-related developments; it applies to a number of other major developments as well.<br><br>
I hope that we shall have a further opportunity to debate that. I have said some things about that in relation, for example, to power station applications, although it is not true that technical assessment cannot be brought into the planning procedure because, as with the Drumbuie inquiry, a technical assessor can be appointed to help the Reporter.<br><br>
These are matters on which I do not believe that we shall get anything like a final solution within a short time. Nor do I believe that we can solve all the infrastructure problems within a short time, because some of them arise strictly out of physical limitations such as the difficulty of obtaining labour and the difficulty of obtaining materials. That is basically the problem of housing in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 106</span>
Shetland. As the right hon. Gentleman well knows, there is the difficulty of getting contractors to come to Shetland in the first place. There is the difficulty of the appallingly high prices that are quoted when they do come—I am not saying unjustifiably, but that happens to be the fact of the situation. We have similar problems in the Moray Firth and Aberdeen areas.<br><br>
There is no way by which the Government can simply wave a magic wand and these problems will then disappear, because they depend on physical limitations of labour and materials. All I can say on all of these matters is that I think the local authorities appreciate—although they do not accept all that the Government do in this area—that we are giving the maximum assistance, including the consideration of additional bridging finance, to them in these areas.<br><br>
North Sea oil represents opportunities for Scotland. It also represents difficulties. We want the opportunities to be fully grasped. We want them to be directed, where possible, to the areas where the jobs are most needed. There are difficulties. We are providing as coherent a structure as we can. We are attempting at long last to get the matter of oil development in Scotland and in the North Sea under effective Government control in the public interest. I believe that we shall succeed in that.</span></p>
