	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafydd Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the Committee have considered the instrument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the Leader of the House and to the House itself for facilitating the Committee. I believe that the step was absolutely necessary, not only because a fundamentally bad decision was taken by the previous Government in over-ruling the inspector's report on the revision order, but because this sort of decision should be taken with Parliament's express consent. I do not want to go into the legal considerations of the matter, but rather the parliamentary and political aspects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me say from the outset that it is clear that this is not a party political issue. In the Porthmadog area the issue cuts right across party lines. It unites Tories and Socialists, Nationalists and Liberals; it unites Welsh and non-Welsh speakers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, it is an issue that rings deep in the Welsh political consciousness. The Rebecca riots of the last century spring readily to mind, and the problems of absentee landlords have been central to Welsh rural politics for a century and a half. It was the oppression by the landlords that fed the great radical revival in the nineteenth century. The public democratic control of the undertakings that greatly affect the public has been the political theme of Socialist Wales in this century.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today I hope that we shall find the same unity of opinion as exists in the Porthmadog area. We have had signatories to an early day motion for the annulment of the order that brought together Labour, Liberal and Plaid Cymru MPs. First, I want to say something about the background of the matter so that hon. Members may appreciate how the present situation has arisen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
Prior to the turn of the last century, the area known now as the Llanfrothen Valley and the Glaslyn Valley, on the border of Merioneth and Caernarvon-shire, was partly or totally covered with water. The land was reclaimed for agricultural purposes by a Mr. W. A. Maddocks, who was given title to the land by an Act of Parliament of 1807. The Act provided for the construction of embankments to hold back the sea water, together with sluice gates. It provided, too, that Mr. Maddocks, his heirs and successors, should have title to about 30,000 acres of agricultural land made usable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The town of Porthmadog grew as a direct consequence of that land reclamation. The major reason for its growth was that in diverting the rivers it was found that a natural harbour had been formed and that it had great economic potential, particularly in handling slate from nearby Ffestiniog. The slate had formerly been brought down river in barges and transferred to ocean-going ships. Now, with the emebankment and harbour, it became possible to run a railway from Ffestiniog to Porthmadog and for the railway to be used for taking slate to the ocean-going ships.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The potential of the development was secured by a further Act of Parliament in 1821. That Act recognised that the newly created harbour did not provide sufficient security and accommodation for the vessels using it. The Act referred to the need:
	<br><blockquote><p>"to construct and make and maintain the Pier, Quay and other works"</p></blockquote>
It further stated that this
	<br><blockquote><p>"would, when approved, be of great benefit to "</p></blockquote>
those
	<br><blockquote><p>"trading to and from"</p></blockquote>
the area and
	<br><blockquote><p>"of great public utility "</p></blockquote>
Clause 6 of the 1821 Act provided for the erection and construction necessary for the convenient lading and unlading of ships and associated activities within the purposes of that Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Act provided that Mr. W. A. Maddocks, his heirs and successors, should provide moorings in the harbour and should appoint a harbour master. It
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0639">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
stated specifically as well that Mr. Maddocks was responsible for the maintenance of the harbour, embankment and sluice works. Section 5 stated that neglect of these functions for a period of 12 months would make void the powers conferred by the Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1821 Act also refers to Cei Newydd, the South Snowdon Wharf, which has recently been sold to a property development company, with considerable local misgiving. By the Act, Mr. Maddocks was entitled to harbour dues, charges and so on and the 1821 Act has not been repealed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the nineteenth century, Porthmadog boomed and by the turn of the century steam was replacing sail and the export of slate declined. In fact, it is clear that by 1913 problems were arising concerning the navigation of the estuary, and the local council minutes of 1913 refer to these problems and to the drawing up of a draft revision order. It is clear that by this time the harbour and its maintenance had become a liability and no person would willingly accept the responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1914, a special council meeting discussed the proposed harbour order and pressed for greater public representation on the proposed new harbour trust. The order came into effect in 1915, although there is some dispute about its validity. The order provided for a new Porthmadog Harbour trust which would comprise 16 trustees, including six from the local district council, six to be elected by specific interests and four to be nominated by interests. It provided for the new trust to acquire the harbour and on the acquisition of this harbour the relevant sections of the 1821 Act were to become inoperative. The order also provided that no sale or lease of land or property should be undertaken without first offering the same to the local district council for purchase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this way the 1915 order was a progressive step, vesting control in a representative trust with a strong public element and also providing for public acquisition of any parts of the undertaking that might be disposed of. It is in stark contrast to the present order, as I hope to show shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The local council undertook its obligations following the passing of the 1915 order by electing its six representatives on
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
14th March 1916 in accordance with the order. However, the new trust appears never to have come into operation, although this must remain an unsolved mystery. In fact, the present order provides for the repeal of the 1915 order, which implies that those drawing up the present draft order were under the impression that the 1915 order was still valid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following the First World War, the harbour decayed still further and the heirs and successors of Mr. W. A. Maddocks, known as the Tremadog Estates, showed virtually no interest in the harbour. From 1915 until 1960, the local residents of Porthmadog and the users of the harbour were allowed unfettered use and enjoyment of its facilities. They may therefore be forgiven for having assumed, on the basis of usage, custom and practice, that the harbour had become part of their inalienable rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said earlier, the harbour was created by building an embankment and by the control of water through sluice works. The Tremadog Estate, having become utterly dormant as far as the harbour was concerned, remained active in the area through another wing of its activities. The estate owns a tollgate on the embankment along which crosses the A497 trunk road from Menai Bridge to Fishguard. As such, it was therefore natural for the local community to turn to the Tremadog Estate when the non-maintenance of these sluice works threatened to flood the whole of the Llanfrothen and Glaslyn valleys in the 1950s.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1953 it was reported to the Gwynedd River Board that the sluice works and embankment were in a deplorable condition, and I quote from the report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"generally it would appear that the whole of the works inspected have had little or no attention by way of maintenance for many years."</p></blockquote>
In 1955, the river board finally instructed the Tremadog Estate to carry out the repair works, but the steps taken by the estate were unsatisfactory. Consequently, the river board was forced to take over responsibility for maintenance of the works. Under the corn-mutation of liability for the maintenance of the works, under Section 9 of the 1.and Drainage Act 1930, Tremadog Estate paid some £32,000 to the board. But this was a totaly inadequate sum and the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0640">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
cost of repair works to date has been over £70,000. All future expenditure on the maintenance of the works will be from public funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was not until about 1960 that the Tremadog Estate started taking any interest in the harbour. From this time onwards, a growth took place in leisure yachting, and the potential of Porthmadog Harbour for this purpose became evident. The trustees began to see the financial potential of the undertaking, and started collecting mooring fees once more. This caused irate local reaction—particularly since the local people had been using the harbour without paying such fees on more than a sporadic basis within the living memory of most people. They flatly refused to pay such charges. The local people were also upset by the way in which new moorings cut across their activities. By 1963 there was open hostility between the various interests and this began to have violent manifestations such as the cutting of moorings and the lifting of anchors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The situation was aggravated when the estate trustees sold off harbour land and facilities for private speculative housing development, such as happened with Cei Newydd, the South Snowdon Wharf, which was directly referred to in the 1821 Act, and also to Greaves Wharf. These transactions were for direct financial gain and not for purposes remotely connected with the harbour undertakings as intended in the 1821 Act, or the order of 1915.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To add to the public's resentment, the trustees even failed to adhere to a planning permission condition protecting public access to the harbour. When a gate was erected upon what the public regarded as a right of way, with a notice to the effect that there was to be no trespassing, the gate was three times forcibly removed and deposited in the harbour. The third time such action was sufficiently successful as to cause the gate never to be found.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The allegation of past mismanagement of the harbour is indisputable. The buoy system has been described as useless for yachting. The deep water channel changes position, but the positions of buoys have remained unchanged. They have often disappeared in a swell because
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
they have been wrongly connected. Because of the bad placing of buoys, some three or four years ago a boat hit a bank and sank. Fortunately, there were no fatalities. There was no control of power boats in the estuary, overcrowding in the harbour was adversely affecting the mussel industry, and there was a lack of orderly moorings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, the Tremadog Estates specifically neglected the repair and replacement of the dangerous sluice gates and the rotten and broken wooden stanchions supporting the harbour wall. There have been no improvements to harbour facilities, nor the provision of new buoys, and there has been no dredging of the harbour mooring area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All this may be contrasted with the safe and orderly manner in which the beach and harbour in the Borth-y-gest area have been operated by the Porthmadog Council with full-time employees maintaining public facilities. In contrast, if I may say so in passing, in 1957 the Porthmadog Harbour had one part-time harbour master paid the grand sum of five shillings a week. The council has passed the necessary by-laws in Borth-y-gest to control and regulate the boating. It is ironic that in the draft order the Tremadog Estates sought to extend their area to take over Borth-y-gest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the 1960s, the public in the Porthmadog area became aggravated by the mismanagement of the harbour. In 1967 the council was a party to a petition sent to the then Minister of Transport calling for better management of the harbour. In 1968, a body known as the Porthmadog Harbour Users' Association was formed, representing the interests of fishermen, musselmen and ships chandlers as well as local authorities. This body pressurised the council to take out its own revision order in 1968 under the 1964 Harbours Act. It was probably to forestall the local council that the existing trustees of the Tremadog Estates promoted their own revision order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Porthmadog Harbour Revision Order of 1971, as drafted, provided for the redefinition and extension of the trust's territorial limits, empowered the trustees to dispose of land and provided for a purely advisory harbour committee —whose advice, it is expressly stated, the trustees could freely ignore. Objections
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0641">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
to the proposed order were made by a number of groups, and public feeling in Porthmadog mounted prior to the inquiry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those feelings arose from several considerations: that traditional free access to the harbour would be restricted; that parts of the harbour would be sold off for property speculation; that the fishing and mussel industries would be squeezed out in order to provide for leisure boating; and that prohibitive charges would be introduced for moorings, harbour dues, slipway fees, and so on, which would price out local people in competition with wealthy holidaymakers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Incidents occurred that bear out this feeling. Boats were cut away from moorings. Moorings themselves were removed. Fencing posts were cut down, and on three occasions heavy steel gates were ripped down and sunk in the harbour. A public meeting in the town attracted more than 2,000 people and when the public inquiry took place, it had to be reaccommodated to allow an average of 150 persons from the general public to attend during its four days of sitting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In June 1972, the inspector who conducted the inquiry advised that the order be not made. In June 1973, his recommendation was turned down by the then Minister for Transport Industries—to the utter amazement of the people of Porthmadog. Eventually, on 8th February 1974, the day after the General Election had been called, the Minister signed the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The basis on which the Minister ostensibly took his decision—and I say " ostensibly " advisedly, as I have already had the opportunity to hear the ex-Minister voice his disaffection with public ownership in another Committee—was a report by the National Ports Council which considered that the trustee's failure in the past gave no indication of their possible future actions; that there was a need for a revision order acceptable to all interests; that it did not really matter whether the harbour should be in public control—despite the fact that public money was sustaining the facilities that enabled the harbour to remain in existence—and that any application by the local council for an order would take a considerable time to come into force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
I quote from the document that was published by the Department of the Environment on 23rd June 1973 announcing the Minister's decision in paragraph 19:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Minister's decision to make the Order …is based primarily on the clear and urgent need for the Harbour authority to have proper powers of control."</p></blockquote>
Forgive me, Mr. English, if I stiffle a hollow laugh at that "urgent need ". The inquiry was in 1972. It took nearly two years to get the Minister's signature to the order. I shudder to think of the speed of progress of non-urgent documents through his Department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, despite the National Ports Council's confidence, shared by the Minister, that the Tremadog Estates would function more efficiently in the future, the experience of the past two years has not borne this out. Buoys are still unmaintained; charging remains haphazard; harbour walls and supporting timbers are delapidating. These things could have been seen to without any new order. Their neglect is the symptom of absentee landlordism whose only motivating force is the certainty of quick financial payback. To suggest that a solution has been reached that is acceptable to all interests defies credibility. Only persons totally ignorant of the area, and arrogant in their ignorance, could have made such a statement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Porthmadog Council and its successor, the Dwyfor Council, have presented a petition against this order, which is being heard elsewhere. Suffice it to say that the Dwyfor Council, which is already acting as harbour authority for neighbouring Pwllheli, contests the order on two main points: the harbour is of public concern and should be publicly controlled in the interest of its users, and not purely for profit motive; that any land being disposed of by the harbour should first be offered to the local authority, as in fact was provided in the 1915 order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It also proposes to put forward its own order as soon as the present one has been annulled. A draft order is already available and could be proceeded with immediately. The petition is supported by the Porthmadog Community Council, and, I understand, by the Gwynedd County Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0642">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
Finally, let me stress that no one disputes the need for a revision order to provide proper management and control. What is in dispute is the correct body in which such powers should be vested. It is a question of whether, in the twentieth century, the ugly face of feudalism should be enshined by parliamentary order. It is a question of whether the most amazing Ministerial decision of all time will be allowed to stand by a Labour Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From what I have said, it can be seen that it was Parliament that conferred upon these beneficiaries the rights of levying charges and of managing the harbour. From those rights for almost a century, William Maddocks and his heirs benefited considerably. When the financial benefit dwindled, no consciousness of public responsibility took over. It was the residents of the area who were left to live with a derelict eyesore. Only when the financial benefit re-emerged did the interest of these people rekindle and then propped up by public funds that had paid for the maintenance which the trustees were unable or unwilling to undertake. What Parliament has given, Parliament can also take away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let there be no mistake about it. This is an issue between the people and the vested powers of wealth. The question before us is whether Parliament is on the side of the people. It is Parliament's duty to find a way of annulling this loathesome, obnoxious and reactionary order. If it does not, it will gain the people's contempt, and the people will then know that their democratic voices count for nothing. The real danger is that they will take the power into their own hands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.48 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Ellis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to begin by apologising to you, Mr. English, and to members of the Committee for not being in my place when the Committee commenced its deliberations. Unfortunately, I also happen to be serving on another Committee, and for that reason I could not be here. It seems that several Committees with which I am concerned in respect of the Porthmadog Harbour Revision Order are meeting contemporaneously, and I am not clear of the precise constitutional arrangements. However, I
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
suspect that, because of the arrangements, this Standing Committee might be, in effect, no more than a place where we can air our opinions without any real practical consequences. To that extent, the whole matter is rather unfortunate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This matter is of considerable importance. Although Porthmadog Harbour—which I know quite well—is a small harbour in a small town, a considerable issue of principle is involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that another hon. Member, whom I did not unfortunately hear, explained the history behind the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the harbour is small, I believe it to have a potential that could be greatly exploited. It is a classic case for municipalisation. Sections of my party have aroused controvery and interest by their statements about nationalisation proposals. Therefore, I find it somewhat odd that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and my right hon. Friend the Minister of Transport should come along with this statutory instrument and this particular—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ellis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take my right hon. Friend's point, but the hon. Member for Caernarvon (Mr. Wigley) said, I think appositely, that what Parliament can give Parliament can take away. Therefore, it seems to me that Government Members shoud be concerned to see that this order is not made, for several reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the first and most important reason is that it flies in the teeth of everything that the Labour Party has ever stood for, and, more particularly, that it flies in the teeth of the mood of the people of the area. These are people who know in their bones that if the order were made it would be wrong; that it would be a travesty of justice. I put it no more strongly than that, and I hope that my Government will take note of what I say. It forms a classic case of the absentee landlord, and I am sure that Lloyd George himself, whose office was no more than 200 yards down the road from the harbour, would have been only too pleased to go to town on the issue. I regret that I am no Lloyd George and

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
am therefore unable to do justice to the cause as he would have done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fred Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham (Mr. Ellis) give me the present political cornpostion of the new district council that covers the Porthmadog area?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ellis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give my hon. Friend the Member for Caerphilly (Mr. Evans) the political colour of the council, but I should be prepared to say that if the people of the area judge the Government by what happens about the order, the political complexion might very well go towards that of a party that represents in an entirely nationalist sense the people of the area. That is my great fear, and that is one reason why I am anxious to make my comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real issue is the position now and as it is likely to become in the future. We can forget the history which the hon. Member for Caernarvon gave us. The issue concerns an important and potentially crucial public utility which, if the order is made, will be controlled by three private people whose sole concern with Porthmadog, to put it simply and bluntly, is what they can get out of the place, no more and no less. I see that as the nub of the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a history of neglect and an insensitivity to the area going hack a considerable time. I recall, when I worked near Porthmadog 30 years ago, seeing the place in a quite derelict state, and I was aware of how the local authority had to spend money on essential repairs to property that it did not own or control. In passing, I add that in the area there are other anachronisms which arise from historical accident, and which I believe are connected with the same group of people who are applicants in the order. One is the tollgate on a busy road running directly into Porthmadog, along which, in the height of the season, 1,000 cars an hour travel causing all kinds of congestion. I believe that such an anachronism concerned with a public utility should be done away with and brought into modern relevance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That historical accident of ownership is anachronistic because the economy of the area, not a strong one. is so dependent on the public utilities of the area. In the past, the basic industry was essentially connected with slate. However,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
today the essential industry is tourism, and public utilities are crucial to that. The economy has been in decline for a long time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recall speaking 12 montis ago to the headmaster of a village school at the nearby village of Penrhyndeudraeth. He had been headmaster there for seven years, and he told me that when he took over there were 265 pupils, whereas last year the number had been reduced to 140. That is a measure of the decline going on in the area, and that is one reason why any development of potential economic resource should be handled by people genuinely concerned with the wellbeing of the area. That is why I believe there should be municipal control and not private control by absentee landlords.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope and pray that the order, although I believe that we in the Committee can do little about it, will not he made. I hope that in due course another order will be laid to ensure that the ownership and control of the harbour resides in the local authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.55 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. D. E. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the discussion. I have a constituency interest in the subject, as the Glaslyn and Deurydd estuaries, which contributed at least as much to the creation of Porthmadog harbour as W. A. Maddock s, serve as the north-western boundary between Merioneth and the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Caernarvon (Mr. Wigley).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The embankment, and for that matter the tollgate, are in my constituency. It is my declared aim to see that filcher of 2½ p and Greater of summer traffic jams removed to provide free access round the main north-south coast route. We are not here to "do a Rebecca" at that tollgate this morning, although that time may come, sooner, perhaps, than the present trustees expect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Porthmadog Harbour itself is in the constituency of my hon. Friend, but the original form of the 1971 proposed order referred to parts of Merioneth, which is why the rural district council prior to reorganisation lodged an objection to the order, along with the harbour users' association. Although my constituency
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0644">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
is not as directly affected by the future control of the harbour as that of my hon. Friend, historically the harbour came into existence through the expansion of the slate industry, carried on mainly in my constituency. Subsequently, some of my constituents earned their livelihood in harbour work, and the most profitable train service in my constituency has its terminus at the harbour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, any development on the Cambrian coast must concern all who live and work in the area and all who represent it at all levels of government. Apart from local interest in the subject, as the hon. Gentleman indicated, the general interest stresses that there are important principles at stake in a decision over the future control of the harbour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Porthmadog is one of a number of small estuarial harbours along the Cardigan Bay coast. I am more knowledgeable about the harbours in my own constituency and I should therefore like to refer briefly to the position of Barmouth harbour which has been under the control of the local authority since the Barmouth Urban District Council Act of 1921 empowered the council to
	<br><blockquote><p>"make and maintain a sea wall, promenade and road",</p></blockquote>
and to take unto itself all powers of the harbour trust. They were vested in Barmouth UDC on 13th April 1930.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since then the harbour has been effectively maintained by the local authority and has now been taken over by its successor, the Merioneth District Council. The council of Barmouth, in my view and in the view of evidence presented to the inquiry in Porthmadog on the draft order, has been able to maintain an efficient and clean harbour. That is in contrast to the situation in Porthmadog. The navigational buoys at Barmouth are maintained in precisely their correct position and incidents of fishing boats or pleasure craft running aground due to faulty buoy placing are minimal in Barmouth. Indeed, Barmouth Harbour is now one of the largest fishing ports on the whole of the North Wales coast and, in contrast with the position at Porthmadog, there is no conflict in Barmouth between the interests of fishing from the harbour and the interests of the 150
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
pleasure craft that are moored on the estuary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is my considered view that it is high time that Porthmadog harbour was run in a similar fashion to Barmouth and other harbours along the coast as a municipal undertaking. I believe that a publicly accountable form of management will be far more able to resolve the serious conflicts of interests in the use of Porthmadog Harbour. That is something with which I should like to deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The general conflict at present in the use of the harbour is not confined to Porthmadog. It is a conflict repeated in most tourist areas, both within and outside national parks. This conflict takes place between local interests and needs and outside control. It also takes place between individual potential uses of the harbour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I begin by mentioning the traditional industry in the harbour, the "	<i>y cregyn dnon</i>", the Porthmadog mussel industry. I have some knowledge because a constituent of mine has recently been granted the lease of some of the Porthmadog mussel beds by the Lancashire and Welsh Sea Fisheries Committee, yet when he and his small company, which dues not have big capital assets, took on the lease it alleged that it found that the beds had been depleted out of all recognition, that they had been killed off by a combination of bad management by the previous lessee and the increasing uncontrolled use of the harbour by yachts. The yacht moorings, according to my constituent, were a significant factor in the depletion of the mussel beds, because the beds had been depleted out of all recognition, that chain moorings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This traditional mussel industry, which has been a feature of Porthmadog, is being threatened with extinction because the conflict of interests between yachting and the traditional industry has not been resolved. The yachting facilities are a recent development at Porthmadog and although these moorings are regularly used by a high proportion of visitors, there are a few local users, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, there is room in Porthmadog Harbour in all senses of that expression, for yachting and fishing to co-exist, as happens in Barmouth. But we must ensure that the interests of both fishing and pleasure yachting are safeguarded by
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0645">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
effective harbour management which, in my submission and in the findings of the inspector in the inquiry, has not been evident.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A more damaging intrusion into the harbour wharves has been the erection of under-utilised housing stock. TI hat is a polite expression for what these properties look like. I refer to the South Snowdon Wharf Cei Newydd development, which I understand is occupied permanently by only three households. The remainder are utilised as so-called second homes, or self-catering holiday accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some instances, these users also own a boat on one of the moorings in the harbour, but many of these homes have only very tenuous links with the harbour itself and arrive there only to be in the smell of what I might describe as a middle-class colour supplement type of ambience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Gentleman define that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In reality, this development is using the harbour wharf only as a site for the worst kind of speculative building, both architecturally and socially.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that this type of development is in contrast with a properly planned maximisation of the harbour's potential, to which the hon. Gentleman has already referred. In effect it has sterilised one wharf, from the point of view of public enjoyment, apart from the middle class colour supplement readers of which I am glad to see that the hon. Member for Caerphilly (Mr. Evans) is one. The use of the harbour by a small clientele has restricted public access to this part of the harbour and has sterilised it for effective public use by the locality for some years to come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This so-called development would not have received planning permission from the new county district.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Douglas Hurd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Presumably the speculative development which the hon. Gentleman criticises so strongly was given planning permission by the local authority which he would like to see take over responsibility for the harbour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was given planning permission by the planning committee of Caernarvonshire County Council. There was strong local objection at the time.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
It is my view from informal discussions that I have had with the new planning authority, the Gwynedd County Council, that this type of development would not be passed in the future on sites of this kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I should like to mention one possible future use of this harbour which cannot have escaped the notice of the promoters of the order. I am referring to the potential for oil and natural gas development in the Celtic Sea. There has already been offshore drilling in Cardigan Bay for natural gas. This has been mainly university based geological research, but that is only one step away from commercial exploration. The number of possible bases for medium scale servicing centres for offshore exploration in the northern sector of the Celtic Sea is limited and Porthmadog is clearly one of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The harbour has had recent industrial servicing use when the Central Electricity Generating Board brought some heavy equipment to its Trawsfynydd Power Station through the harbour. The Central Electricity Generating Board still retains a crane on one wharf. The potential of Porthmadog as a small servicing and supply base cannot have escaped the notice of the promoters of this order. The people prepared to sell one wharf for a piece of speculative building, when the second-home industry began to boom in Gwynedd will no doubt make every effort to sell off the remaining wharves if the spin-off from oil or gas exploration becomes the new investment in this area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To sum up; I believe that all the exist-and projected conflicts of interest to which I referred point to one thing—the inadequacy of quasi-feudal private enterprise to devise the balanced strategy needed to contain each of these interests. I do not believe that a private estate can hope to have the expertise in environmental planning necessary to administer this harbour, let alone devise a strategy for a programmed use of the harbour in future. The new authorities of Dwyfor and Merioneth and the new county council of Gwynedd certainly have the acquired expertise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be countered by supporters of this order that planning expertise can be bought, but Dwyfor Council has something further that cannot be bought—it is answerable to the people of Porthmadog. The fundamental conflict between
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0646">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
local need and external exploitation can never be resolved by a private estate with its headquarters outside the area. This is why the Local Government Act 1972 vested national park control locally in elected representatives. The same principle must finally apply here. The environment of Porthmadog and the future of the harbour are too valuable to be entrusted to private interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the view strongly that this Session of Parliament must ensure that this Order is not carried through and that an alternative order which will vest control for the harbour in Dwyford District Council must be confirmed. To quote an appropriate proverb "	<i>Trech gwlad nac Arglwydd</i>".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I call Mr. Fred Evans.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Gibson-Watt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. English. I and other members of the Committee find ourselves in some difficulty. We have heard the history of this order from members of the Committee, but it would greatly help the Committee if the Minister could at this stage tell us the history of it. It would greatly help the Committee if at this stage the Minister could tell us what his view is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order. It is certainly not for me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mulley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the matter has been raised, may I say that I am at the disposal of the Committee. As this discussion is following the normal course of a Prayer, I thought it right to listen to the debate. I did half rise, but then I saw that a lot of hon. Members wanted to speak. It is a difficult matter for me, but if the Committee would like to hear me now I should not be unduly long and I should be happy to do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have called Mr. Evans.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.8 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fred Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. English. I think that we are taking a very big stick to beat a very little dog. I liked the tribute which the hon. Member for Caernarvon (Mr. Wigley) paid to Barmouth. It so happens that my wife's uncle, I think, is one of the leading members of that council. It also so happens that another uncle, who died about six
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
months ago, was a leading light in Penrhyndeudraeth, so perhaps, as one who is denied his Welsh-hood by certain people in my own country, I may speak with some confidence and safety in this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact of the matter is that the powers lie with the local authorities. When the hon. Member holds up Barmouth as an example, he should realise that it is within the powers of the local authority to do the same in Porthmadog, so why we should labour this point is beyond me. As a Socialist, I am all for using municipalisation as an instrument for public ownership, but the plain fact of the matter is that in that area although the powers lie within its ambit—or should I say ambience—the local authority has not taken advantage of them. But this has been used as a stick to beat political opponents, and the hon. Member knows it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why not go back to the local authorities and say, as I am sure the Minister will point out, "You have the powers, get on with the damned job and not chuck it about "?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I point out that the local authority already has a draft order and is willing and eager to pursue it? This matter having been the subject of a public inquiry in 1972, the local authority naturally had to await the outcome of that before it could do anything further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is nothing to do with this Committee, is it? The local authority can press it and press it. It is within its powers, and that is it, so let the ball rest where it belongs. It is in the local authority's hands, so let us not make a big issue of this—although I entirely agree that one can enshrine a whole principle in something very small,
	<br><blockquote><p>"To see a World in a Grain of Sand ".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ellis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend believe that if something happens by the default of the local authority this absolves us from taking any part at all in expressing our opinions as to the possibility, if what my hon. Friend says is correct, of something happening by default?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an entirely different question. The powers are there, and they can be used. I am sure that the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0647">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
Minister will say, and I invite him to say so now, that it is not necessary to await the outcome of the public inquiry before proceeding with the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.13 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mulley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham (Mr. Ellis) said that many issues of principle are involved in the question before the Committee, and I think that in many senses that is right. On the other hand, I thought that in moving the motion the hon. Member for Caernarvon (Mr. Wigley) very delicately and daintily stepped away from the main issue before us when he prefaced his remarks by saying that he was not going to concern himself with the legal aspects of the matter. I do not know how this Committee, the House, or anyone else can step aside from the legal situation when we arc in fact being asked to change the law. That is the exercise in which we are engaged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, with great respect to the hon. Gentleman, I think that we must look at this order not only or mainly from the point of view of the passion that I understand these issues have aroused, not only recently but, from his account, over a long period of time. We have to see how the proposals for this order came to be made, their purpose, and what the situation would be if the House took his advice and rejected the order. And that is what I shall try briefly to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the issue of principle, I should not have thought that anyone would doubt my sympathy, not to put it any higher, with the hon. Gentleman's general proposition that it is much better that ports and harbours—particularly those with commercial and cargo-handling characteristics, although that does not particularly apply here—should be under some form of public control. Indeed, I personally piloted a Bill in 1970 to do this for a large number of ports. And, as the hon. Gentleman knows, the Labour Party's manifesto is absolutely clear on this. So there is no difference between us on the desirability of public ownership or municipal ownership in some form —ownership other than the evidently, from what he says, very unsatisfactory arrangements which now obtain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should make it quite clear, however, that this revision order, which is made under Section 14 of the Harbours Act
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
1964, was applied for by the trustees of Tremadoc Estate who own the harbour. My predecessor, the then Minister for Transport Industries, since there were obviously objections, as one can well understand, having listened to the debate, caused a public inquiry to be held. As the hon. Gentleman said, the inspector at that inquiry, I think following the same kind of reasoning as the hon. Gentleman, said that he too was going to leave the legal aspects to the Secretary of State to concern himself with, and recommended against the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May we just clarify something, if we are coming back to this legal question? When I made that observation earlier in the debate, I was referring particularly to the validity of the 1915 order, which has been under considerable dispute. As the question has come up now, perhaps the right hon. Gentleman could clarify whether he regards that order as being existent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mulley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understood the hon. Member to make that observation before he said anything else. He made his observation about not concerning himself with the legal aspects a long time before he got to 1807, never mind 1915. I understand that we do not contest the validity of the 1915 order, but of course it has never operated, and we are now in 1974. I was not born in 1915, so the hon. Gentleman can hardly charge me with responsibility for any failure then. I think that the legal advice I would give the Committee is that we should regard the order as defunct. I think that any order that had not been acted upon for about 60 years would be a bit difficult to resurrect, but it has not technically been repealed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whichever way the hon. Member would wish to move from here, I do not think that he would want to go back to 1915. We should want a new order. As I have said, this is an application under Section 14 of the Harbours Act. There was a public inquiry, and I imagine that almost any other new form of order or proposed order would also need a new public inquiry, should that question arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Gentleman said, in June 1973 the then Minister issued a statement, which I understand was widely circulated in the usual way, giving the reasons why he proposed to make the harbour revision
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0648">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
order. Whilst it is no function of mine to speak for my predecessor, I think it is right that we should put on record the reasons that he gave for that decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 19 of the decision letter, which was sent to all interested patties, states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Minister's decision to make the order substantially as submitted is based primarily on the clear and urgent need for the Harbour authority to have proper powers of control, irrespective of the form and composition of that authority. He expresses no view on the desirability or otherwise of the harbour being controlled by some form of public or semipublic body, as advocated by a number of objectors. It would, of course, he open to any person or body having a substantial interest in the harbour subsequently to apply for an order under Section 14 of the Harbour Act 1964 to reconstitute the existing harbour authority, providing the order was one which met the requirements of the Act set out in Section 14(2) and Schedule 2. The Minister's present decision "—</p></blockquote>
the Committee will appreciate that I am quoting my predecessor and that it is not myself speaking—
	<br><blockquote><p>"implies no pre-judgment of such an application if one were to be made. He nevertheless considers it would be sensible to allow a reasonable period for experience to be gained of the operation of the powers conferred in the present order."</p></blockquote>
That is something about which everyone should be absolutely clear, and I hope Opposition Members will ensure that that is so in their constituencies. The one person who cannot introduce or make an order to change ownership is the Minister. There are no powers whatever for that purpose. It is open under Section 14 for an application to be made by any person or body having a substantial interest in the harbour, and that, as we know, would cover the local authorities concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What surprises me, coming as I do fairly new to this problem, is why, having regard to the history as related by the public inquiry and the inspector's report, and related perhaps a little more dramatically by the hon. Members this morning, somebody has not done something about it over all these years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Harbours Act has been in force for 10 years, but there was no need to wait for that measure. Never have I heard one hon. Member so neatly answered by another hon. Member as the hon. Member for Merioneth (Mr. Thomas)
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
answered the hon. Member for Caernarvon (Mr. Wigley). To use the old nautcial term, he sank him without a trace. Porthmadog could have done exactly what Barmouth did. Since 1807, any local authority could have applied for these powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Gentleman accept, despite the political points that he is making,—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mulley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am making no political points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: —against the now disappeared Porthmadog Urban District Council, that the historical position is no justification for the present situation to continue? I think it is right to say that the new Dwyfor District Council is preparing an order to regulate the harbour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mulley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not making any political points. I thought I was dealing with the matter dispassionately and coolly from a wholly legal point of view. I was making a point which I think is incontrovertible, namely, that any local authority—before I had the benefit of listening to the hon. Member for Merioneth I intended to make the proposition in general terms—could have applied in this House for the necessary powers. I had not realised that the hon. Member intended to give me chapter and verse in the case of Barmouth. He spoke about it applying for powers in the 1920s or 1930s.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Had there been the case which I understand now exists, and had there been the strong feelings which I am told are evident, I should have thought that the council would have applied for these powers. This is nothing to do with local government reorganisation, which is a recent problem. However, I shall come to what the situation will be if, as some hon. Gentlemen suggest, the order is not made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make it quite clear that in this matter I, as Minister, have no powers to introduce an order or a Private Bill. That has to be done by bodies or persons with a substantial interest in the harbour. As I understand it—and I gather from the speeches this morning that there is no real dispute about this—regardless of which body or bodies should be the owners of the harbour, there is a real

need for increased powers of management for safety purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference has been made to the bad positioning of buoys. Paragraph 13 of the decision letter from which I quoted set out the view of the National Ports Council. It said that the National Ports Council
	<br><blockquote><p>"disagreed with the Inspector's recommendations "—</p></blockquote>
namely, that there should be no order—
	<br><blockquote><p>"for the following reasons:</p></blockquote>
a. The primary purpose of the order is to provide a new modern code of powers for the management of the harbour. This is not disputed by the objectors, one of whom commented "—
here reference is made to paragraph 75 of the Inspector's report—
	<br><blockquote><p>"on the 'risk of serious accident' and the need for a ' revision order acceptable to all interests' without delay."</p></blockquote>
The order having been made on 8th February, I had no option but to follow the procedure laid down by the Statutory Orders (Special Provisions) Act 1945, as amended by the 1965 Act, and after six weeks advertise the fact that the order had to be laid before the House. I am now following the usual parliamentary procedure for these special orders, and the date was agreed with the petitioners. A special Joint Committee of both Houses is to be held this afternoon to hear objections from the petitioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, in a sense, we are in a most unusual position, because this is not a statutory instrument that has been made in the normal way made under ministerial powers and subject to annulment by the House. The Committee could if it wished deny to those who have petitioned against the order the opportunity of presenting their case to the House, so that not only the House, but through the House the public, can know the pros and cons of the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of ownership is not one that we can determine now. It may be— I am not privy to this knowledge—that the local authority has a draft order in its files. We know nothing about it. Indeed, if it were to move by going through the procedures laid down under the Harbours Act or by seeking parliamentary powers by a Private Bill, that would be considered on its merits. Personally—as I think the hon. Gentle-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
man knows—I should not be unsympathetic to the objectives that he set out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question about which we have to be absolutely clear is that the making of the order before us would in no way prevent or prejudice any later action to change the ownership. All that we are concerned about—we have no powers to amend the order in the way that the hon. Member for Caernarvon (Mr. Wigley) suggested—is that we are providing a more modern code of regulation-making powers for the safety and administration of the harbour, the same kind of powers that any body, whether a local authority or anybody else, would want to have. We are providing ready-made powers, although a new order could amend them if that was desired.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only issue before the Committee is whether the order should be turned down. If that were to happen the feudal ownership, to quote the hon. Member, would remain, and the harbour would continue under the feudal administration which the present trustees wish to change. That is the only question before us, and it does not prejudice in any way any further action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept what the Minister says, but the term referred to is a reasonable length of time for trying out this order, and it has been suggested that that could be five years. During that time disposal of the assets could take place, and that would be totally irreversible. That is why I believe the annulment should happen now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mulley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am advised that there is no legal reason why one should wait five years, or any period of time. The House might get impatient if an order were submitted merely changing in a small way some of the management proposals. But if the order were concerned with a change of ownership, or if it were a private Bill to change the ownership by the local authority acquiring it, that would be a separate issue. I should not have thought that there could be any possible time objection. If these proposals were made, it would come before the Minister if it were a special order, and before the House if it were a Private Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we do not go ahead with the order now, the ownership—satisfactory or unsatisfactory according to one's point of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0650">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>27</span>
view—will remain as it is. The only effect, if we take the hon. Member's advice, will be that against its own wishes, and against the declared wishes of everybody using it and everybody in the locality, it will have no power to administer and to lay down safety regulations which the increasing recreational use of the harbour clearly demands. Therefore, I should have thought that the Committee would agree that the sensible course is for the order to complete the statutory processes in the Joint Committee which is due to meet this afternoon. The basic question of change of ownership cannot be tacked on by way of amendment. It has to come from the persons who are prepared to accept the responsibilities of ownership. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would not wish to be personally responsible for running the harbour, and neither he nor I could require the local authority to take on the obligations unless it so desired. The initiative clearly has to come in the ways laid down from the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we do not have the order now, all that we shall have will be no change of ownership and the continuation of unsatisfactory powers. The detailed powers are subject to the consideration of the Joint Committee which will have the benefit of having before it the petitioners' evidence and being able to examine it in the usual way in which this House and the other place carefully go into Private Bill legislation and special powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest to the Committee that that would be the proper course to recommend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.32 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Edwards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Caernarvon (Mr. Wigley) chose to launch into a wide-ranging attack on private ownership and various aspects of administration. I think that the case he made to the Committee would have been listened to with greater respect had he made it with greater moderation, and had he approached the task in hand with a greater understanding of the mechanics of the operation, because, as the Minister pointed out, the hon. Gentleman has got it wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman talked about the ugly face of feudalism and I think that he fairly pointed to some failings of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
trustees in recent years, but for the sake of the historical record it might be worth going back to the beginning if only because it is an exciting and romantic story and a good example of private enterprise. Anyone who has studied the original history of the construction of these works will agree that it was a tremendous enterprise. It has been vividly recorded by Elizabeth Beasley in her book on the subject, and it is the subject of great fascination to this day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point that I want to dwell on is the principle to which the Minister referred. It was brought out by the hon. Member for Wrexham (Mr. Ellis) when he said that what Parliament can give Parliament can take away. If we are dealing with ownership, it is important that we set about these matters in the right way. The hon. Gentleman may or may not be right about what he had to say about private ownership. I do not think that in many respects he was right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the 1821 Act—which, incidentally, is a fascinating document for anyone who cares to read it—Parliament gave to William Maddocks, his heirs and executors, the ownership of this property and control over it for ever. That phrase "for ever" repeats itself at intervals during this long piece of nineteenth century legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to take away ownership, we should do so properly and only after careful consideration; the same sort of consideration as was given by the House when the Act was originally passed. It should not be done as a sort of incidental effect of dealing with an order on administration. This is something which, if it is to be done, should be done only after full and proper debate and consideration of the kind of issues that the hon. Gentleman outlined in his speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister told us, this whole matter could have been dealt with by those concerned, if they had wished to deal with it, in a different way, either by bringing forward legislation for Parliament to consider, or by bringing forward a different order under Section 14 of the 1964 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are therefore left with an order which establishes a committee on which local interests are represented. I concede that that same article of the order says that the trustees are not bound to act in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0651">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>29</span>
accordance with such advice, but in the circumstances that we are debating, and with the possibility of other orders being brought forward, the trustees would be extremely foolish and shortsighted to ignore the strong local feelings that have been voiced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But in any case, Article 15 of the order gives considerable powers to the Secretary of State to insist upon the proper maintenance and upkeep of the harbour works and other works below tidal levels. Therefore, there are powers to ensure that the trustees carry out their proper functions of maintenance and repair. Incidentally the original Act lays down that if the trustees allow a breach in the embankment that is the one circumstance which they automatically lose control, and their interest in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends have not set about this matter in the right way. If this order were not proceeded with, we should be in a worse state than we would if it were passed. We would be back in the kind of feudal world which he described, without adequate controls and without the safeguards introduced in the order. We would be in a state of chaos, and there is no virtue in that situation. Therefore, the position of the Committee is quite clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are concerned that the passing of the order as it stands will prejudice the introduction and rapid movement through the House of an alternative order or of private legislation that will ensure that control does go into the hands of the district authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edwards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have already heard from the Minister that there is no reason why that should delay matters. I would have a good deal more sympathy with that argument if there had been more signs of action in the past from those concerned. It is extraordinary that only when an order is in its final stages and people are suddenly confronted with a situation that they say " We must not have it because it might delay further action ", when they could have taken action at any time in recent years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had a vivid account from the hon. Gentleman of the neglect, the decay and action that had to be taken by local authorities and yet nothing was done. Only now, when we have this order, are people saying, "We should not have
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
the order because we do not have the time to do anything about it." It is a bad argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am prepared to listen, as are my right hon. and hon. Friends, to the arguments for a new order or a new piece of legislation, but there seems to be no doubt that for the moment we are left with this order, and the best thing to do is to make the best of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.40 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwynoro Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find myself in a peculiar situation—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not for the first time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not for the first time, as my hon. Friend the Member for Caerphilly (Mr. Evans) says, but I think that on this issue I am probably on the side of the angels, as I shall show in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that all we can do in this Committee is to consider the question of ownership. And since, the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Edwards), emphasised, this is governed by the Act of 1821, we are not in a position to do anything else with regard to ownership.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mulley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just to get the position clear, may I say that I understand we can do nothing at all. We have no powers to act, but I have made the general point that the House, through its various procedures, cannot bring in a different kind of order from the present one. It has either to accept or to reject this order. I have double-checked this point, as the question has been raised. If this order is passed, there is no bar to the local authority or anyone else making an application for another order. I gather that it could apply to the Minister tomorrow for a Section 14 order. There is no time bar at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend confirms the basic issue. I am glad to hear him advise us that the House has power to reject the order. I understand his particular problem, because this order was signed by his predecessor. He has therefore inherited a problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is of no use for us to say that the local authority has been slow to act. Every one of us in our own constituencies can think of instances when local authorities over the years have been slow to act on a particular situation. I am sure that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0652">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>31</span>
the hon. Member for Pembroke is a classic example of a Member who is able to exploit local grievances. I am sure that he can think of instances in Pembrokeshire where the local council over the years has been slow and has not shown genuine concern for the residents of a particular area. My hon. Friend the Member for Caerphilly can quote several instances in Glamorganshire of local authorities over the years being slow to act in given situations and circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that the local authorities in this area have not acted with due haste and speed with due concern in years gone by —that is irrefutable and no one would dispute it—but we are now considering an order, and I must say that it is a remarkable order. Article 13 reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If any goods are left on or in any part of the harobur estate the Trustees may require the owner of the goods to remove them, and if the goods are not removed within six hours".</p></blockquote>
Is that the kind of order that my right hon. Friend would gladly defend? Is that the kind of order that Members on this side came here to pass and to approve—that sort of instant decision? If the trustees so desire, that is it. Within a matter of hours—not after a few days and after due consideration of the matter —the trustees have power there and then to decide the fate of any goods or materials that are left on the harbour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Pembroke made some reference to a committee and said that it is a redeeming feature of the order. According to the hon. Gentleman we are all right; local option, local concern and local participation still survive even in Porthmadog; the House of Commons will take care of the people of the area, and there will be a special committee to advise the trustees. But then I read Article 6(6):
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Committee member appointed by the Trustees shall, from time to time (but at least once in every year)"</p></blockquote>
request that a meeting should be called. That is the extent of local participation. That is the extent of the constraints that this order will place on the owners.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You began your speech by castigating local government for its negligence. You are now castigating central government for its negligence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member will recollect that I did neither.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>32</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. English.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend must be aware that it was his argument and that of the hon. Member for Pembroke that led me on this path. I agree with him entirely that for various reasons, local authorities over the year have not been able to act in the best interests of the locality. We could quote instances up and down the land.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edwards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman ought to be taken up on his last point about the committee meeting once a year. It is within the power of all the members of the committee to call such meetings, and one of the members of the committee is a member of the local authority. If the local authority wants meetings more often than once a year, it is up to it to call them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware of the point. By approving this order, we are being very generous. We are allowing fair play. Democracy is not dead. We are at least allowing the people of the area, the local authority, to have one member on the committee. He can call a meeting to advise the trustees, but the trustees can shut the door and say, "We do not want to listen to you, anyway ". Fair play! It is no wonder that people are becoming synical about the relevance of Parliamentary democracy, when the hon. Member for Pembroke gets up and says what a fine thing we are doing by allowing the trustees to be advised and saying that the local authority member can call a meeting. I am sure that, on reflection, he would not want to defend that argument in Pembrokeshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, what my right hon. Friend says is quite true. We are not discussing ownership. We are not seeking at this stage to change ownership. We are dealing with an order, and I dare say—although I am probably dabbling in dangerous waters here—that it is not one which he, in his heart of hearts, is glad to approve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mulley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I have said several times, and as the date and the signature indicate, I did not approve the order. I laid it before Parliament, under the directions of Parliament, following the provisions of the Special Powers Act of 1945.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I concurred with my right hon. Friend on that when I said that it
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0653">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>33</span>
was the Minister for Transport Industries whose name was at the end of the order. That is clearly the case. But the view in Wales, Caernarvonshire and Merionethshire will be that the order was passed—and I advise my right hon. Friend the hon Members for Caernarvon (Mr. Wigley) and Merioneth (Mr. Thomas) will make the issue quite clear —in the days of a Labour Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I urge on my right hon. Friend the view that we must consider this question seriously. When we say that we have power to reject or revoke the order, we are saying something fundamental. We are saying that we will give the local authority—rather belatedly, it is true—the opportunity to redeem itself, to bring forward its own order on the lines of the advance that has been made in Barmouth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am suspicious about this order. After decades of neglect and lack of concern with developments in the area, these people come along when Wales has become a major tourist attraction area— indeed it is one of our growth industries, bringing more than £120 million per year to the economy of Wales—and an order of this kind arrives on the scene. My right hon. Friend and every Member of the Committee should be suspicious of this order. These people had this right as long ago as 1821, but they have only now discovered the potential value of the harbour and want to put the development in that area to their own use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham (Mr. Ellis) said, the Labour Party believes—I am sure it was in our
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>34</span>
manifesto last time, and it will be in our manifesto next time—that where public money has been pumped into any concern, development or scheme, as has happened here—public money has been used to sustain this dilapidated harbour—the public must take over and have a direct interest in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is the case—in many instances it is quite right—I cannot understand why we are loth, in this instance when public money has been spent to develop and sustain the harbour, to say to the trustees, " We do not intend to grant you this order. We intend to allow the local authority to redeem itself and bring forward its own order and we will consider it carefully ". I am sure that the people of North-West Wales would be glad if Parliament did that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This matter is about the relevance of Parliament. It is not a Welsh issue. One can think of issues of this kind throughout the land. It happens to be in North-West Wales, but it is about the relevance of Parliament. It is how we in this place, knowing local feeling on any given matter, react and respond to local feeling and demands. On this issue, my right hon. Friend and everyone else should be in no doubt whatsoever what local feeling in North-West Wales is about this order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
