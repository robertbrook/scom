DRAFT ROYAL ORDNANCE FACTORIES TRADING FUND ORDER 1974</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State for Defence (Mr. William Rodgers)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On this rather desolate morning, I beg to move
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee have considered the draft instrument.</p></blockquote>
I hope that it will be to the convenience of the Committee, given the limited time available for discussion, if I introduce the Order as briefly as possible and endeavour to deal with particular points as appropriate in any closing remarks I may seek to make.<br><br>
This is the first Order to be moved under the Government Trading Funds Act 1973, and it may be helpful if I recall its purpose. It is an enabling Act under which certain Crown services may be financed by trading funds where the responsible Minister considers that this will lead to improved commercial performance and public accountability. The introduction of a trading fund requires the making of an Order under the Act, subject to approval by resolution of the House.<br><br>
The Royal Ordnance Factories are one of the Crown services specifically named in the Act. They constitute a substantial manufacturing organisation with an estimated output in 1974–75 of over £100 million and employing about 18,000 men and women, who are, and will remain under the Order, civil servants. They form part of the Procurement Executive within the Ministry of Defence—I am currently Chairman of the Board of the ROFs—and are responsible for the manufacture of a wide range of defence stores for the Armed Forces and for Commonwealth and other Governments. They are concerned mainly with production but also undertake some work at the design and development stages.<br><br>
The Fulton Report stressed the need for accountable management in the Civil
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
Service. Subsequently the Royal Ordnance Factories were reviewed by the Committee on Government Industrial Establishments —better known, as members of the Committee will recall, as the Mallabar Committee—whose report was presented to Parliament in July 1971. The Committee reported favourably on the ROF organisation—and I would recommend to members of the Committee a full reading of the report if they can spare the time—which it considered well managed and cost conscious and, in recommending that it should remain part of the Ministry of Defence, took the view that it should operate under a Trading Fund rather than be financed by annual Parliamentary Votes. The ROFs would be able to demonstrate their professional ability more readily if they were made responsible for managing their capital assets. They would be able to make better informed decisions in relation to the provision of capacity and the purchase of munitions and, in addition, the true resource costs of operating the ROFs would be demonstrated. Following a departmental study of the future role of the ROFs, the spirit of the recommendation of the Mallabar Report was endorsed, but legislation was necessary to change over to a trading fund system.<br><br>
The ROF organisation already operates with a commercial accounting system but, as stated in the Mallabar Report, a trading fund will now provide the organisation with a financial structure more like that of a public corporation or a commercial undertaking.<br><br>
The ROF management will be given new responsibilities and, in particular, under their managing director, who will be their accounting officer, the ROFs will be required to achieve a financial objective. In the manner in which they operate they will, of course, continue to be subject to the policy of the Ministry of Defence, and departmental Ministers will continue to be answerable to Parliament for the way in which the organisation is run.<br><br>
Turning now to the Order, it is proposed that the ROF Trading Fund should come into operation on 1st July 1974. That is the " appointed day " mentioned in Article 2 of the Order.<br><br>
Article 4 deals with public dividend capital. Taking the capital of the organisation as a whole, Section 2(1) of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0534">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
enabling Act provides for the appropriation to the trading fund of the Crown assets and liabilities attributable to the particular Crown service. In the case of the ROF Trading Fund, the initial valuation of net assets expected to be appropriated amounts to about £100 million. About £65 million will consist of stocks, work in progress and debtors less creditors taken at their current value. The remainder—about £35 million—consists of plant, buildings and land valued in accordance with Treasury directions.<br><br>
Article 4 of the Order shows the element of public dividend capital as £35 million, which is 35 per cent. of the whole. Public dividend capital is appropriate to the Royal Ordnance Factories in that they are a viable undertaking, will be required to meet specific financial targets, and will be expected to provide earnings on public dividend capital at least equal to the interest which would have been paid on fixed interest loan capital. The balance of capital of some £65 million will be created by debt to the National Loans Fund.<br><br>
Article 5 of the Order sets out a borrowing limit of £50 million for the organisation. This is expected to be sufficient for the next five years. Taken with the funds that the organisation is expected to generate internally, it should enable it to replace assets, to fund increases in the value of stocks and work in progress, and to cater for fluctuations in working capital arising from the normal ebb and flow of manufacture and sales.<br><br>
The Schedule does no more than spell out in legal terms the current range of the organisation's activities. It provides for the manufacture of defence stores for the British services and overseas customers consistent with the Government's policy. It also enables alternative work to be undertaken—as has been the case over many years—where this can make use of defence capacity which may be temporarily under-employed although, as indicated by the wording of the Schedule, this is ancillary to its principal function.<br><br>
I should let members of the Committee know the financial objective for the ROF organisation which it is intended to specify in a Treasury Minute to be laid before the House shortly under Section 4(1) of the Act. The Act provides that a trading fund organisation should be man
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
aged in such a way that revenue is sufficient to meet expenditure, taking one year with another, and that it should also meet further financial objectives laid down. The ROF objective over the four and three-quarter years up to 31st March 1979 will be to secure a surplus, after paying interest on the fixed interest debt and borrowings and placing to reserve the difference between depreciation based on replacement cost and book value, sufficient to be capable of paying an average of 10 per cent. annually on the £35 million public dividend capital; the actual dividend to be paid for any one year will be determined at the time. Earnings in the first two years are not likely to reach this level because on some existing contracts they will be lower on account of recent increased costs of materials, higher wages and salaries, and the effects of the energy crisis; but later years' results should enable the objective to be met.<br><br>
If members of the Committee or other Members of the House would like to visit one or more of the ROFs at any time, I would be only too glad to arrange it. They are an impressive organisation within the Public Service, marked by high skills and great loyalty. I commend the ROF organisation, and I commend this Order to the Committee.</span></p>
<p>10.40 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tom King</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I join the Minister of State in the general welcome to the Order which he has just introduced. As he fairly said, this is the first Order under the enabling Act passed by the previous Government, following the recommendations of the Fulton Committee, to set up a number of the more industrial activities of Government service under a more independent management structure.<br><br>
It is particularly important that this matter should not merely pass on the nod, with a brief introduction from the Minister—although that is no criticism, because he covered every point relevant to this Order. But we are dealing with a very important subject. We are dealing with an activity with a turnover of more than £100 million, employing 18,000 people; it operates at 12 different sites. If it were a private company, it would certainly be a Category 1 activity. I will refer to the implications of that in a moment.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0535">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
I am on my feet because one of the Royal Ordnance factories is in my constituency of Bridgwater. I have already taken up the Minister of State's kind invitation, and I am closely in touch with the management, the unions and shop stewards. Recently, I have discussed with the Minister of State certain problems which have arisen at the Royal Ordnance factory at Bridgwater. I am disappointed, although no doubt there are good reasons, that none of my other colleagues in the House who have Royal Ordnance factories in their constituencies has taken the opportunity to speak. It is probably the only opportunity that they will have. This is a further point that arises out of the Order, as to how many future opportunities there will be to discuss the activities of the Royal Ordnance Factories.<br><br>
When my hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives (Mr. Nott), then Minister of State, Treasury, piloted the original Government trading funds legislation through the House, he sought to reassure Members that there would be no lack of parliamentary accountability and no essential change. But I think that the matter should be raised independently. I appreciate that the Minister of State will still be responsible. My understanding is that hon. Members will be entitled to table Questions to him about any of the activities of the ROF and that full parliamentary responsibility will be preserved in this way. It might be important if he could confirm that point on the record, because there will no longer be a vote on the defence account; but I assume that there will be published trading accounts and balance sheets submitted to Parliament independently of the main Ministry of Defence vote.<br><br>
This measure is intended to give more independent freedom to management and a greater degree of management accountability. But, before moving on to the management situation I should first like to clarify the position of those employed. This perhaps is repeating partly what the Minister said, that there is no change in their situation as industrial civil servants; that there is no change in their pension situation; and their rights are continuous. I re-state that, because this is an important point of concern to many of my constituents.<br><br>
What has been done to explain this measure to all those working in the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
factories? Do they really understand what is happening? It may look to them rather like shuffling cards from one hand to the other and not adding up to very much. But I am sure that the Minister would agree that, if it is to achieve its objective as envisaged in the Fulton Report, it should be seen to have some impact. It should be seen to be a real change and to mean something, not just passing pieces of paper around in Parliament. It should mean something to everybody in the operation. If it is to mean something to everybody, it must be accompanied with reassurance that their pension and other rights are not affected.<br><br>
However, I hope that some aspects of their employment will be affected. The Minister will know that I have been very concerned about the situation, particularly in the Bridgwater factory. There is an unhappy situation in the ROFs at present where some of the plants are on productivity schemes. Bridgwater is excluded but, worse than that, some of the people in the Bridgwater plant are on a productivity scheme and others are not. I am not quite sure who the employing body now is, but the employees of the ROF, as I understand it, basically move to some new situation—I do not know whether it is the Royal Ordnance Factories Trading Fund Limited or what the managing director situation is, but does this apply to everybody working in the Royal Ordnance factory? We have Department of Employment personnel in the factory. There are also the QADM of the ROF working under different wage rates, and getting productivity bonuses, often for less hazardous work than many of the main ROF employees who enjoy no such productivity bonus.<br><br>
Most hon. Members will know that we are rapidly approaching 1st July—or I cannot remember whether it is 4th July, which to the Minister of State and me is a very significant date—on which we are hoping for a substantial improvement in the situation. But I cannot look with complete comfort on a situation in which an activity which the Government regard as important is paying its employees—men of some experience in the industry—as little as £17 a week in take-home pay. They have lost 180 people from that plant in the past 12 months, and I believe that the replacements are only about 20. The whole salary situation and the lack
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0536">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
of a productivity scheme, which is enjoyed in other plants, is producing one answer—people are voting with their feet and going off in other directions. With a situation in which apprentices can get £7 a week more in other factories in the area, doing similar and often less demanding work, this is no way to build a career structure in this important industry.<br><br>
Greater management freedom coupled with greater management accountability, if taken in the right sense and coupled with a productivity scheme—because, clearly, I am advocating, not that everybody should merely receive more money, but that this must be combined as far as possible with productivity, so that people feel that they are doing a meaningful job, and that they have the opportunity to give of their best efforts and to be rewarded for it—will produce throughout the plant a much more satisfactory situation.<br><br>
I turn now to the point about management accountability. I had a nasty feeling that I would have to berate the Minister of State because I thought that he was not going to tell us the financial target, and I was going to say that this was absolutely outrageous if the order is to take effect from 1st July. I am delighted that this point has been covered. I think also that one must accept that the financial target is reasonable in the circumstances.<br><br>
The phrase used by the Minister of State originally was that the financial target should represent the opportunity cost of the capital. I have never heard that expression in the financial world. I may lead a sheltered life and perhaps it is a very familiar phrase, but I take it to mean what the money could earn it otherwise invested. Of course 10 per cent. is not, in the current situation, the opportunity cost of the capital. Although this is a departure from the original proposal, with the volatile nature of current interest rates and the longer term planning strategy of one year with another, which is the only way one can plan an operation of this size, I think it is realistic not to chase after the current fashion or level of interest rates but to set out some longer term objective. At the same time I think it is important that the Committee should recognise, because besides representing all those people who work in the ordnance factory in my constituency, one
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
must also represent everybody in this country who helps to pay for the activities, and the taxpayers, that this represents a negative return on capital. If it produces a return of 10 per cent., that is below the opportunity cost of the capital at this time. The Minister also qualified it by saying that even the 10 per cent. would not be reached in the first couple of years.<br><br>
The management clearly has a major challenge in front of it. In this connection I was disappointed that the Minister was not able to say more about the future prospects for the industry and for the factories concerned. I appreciate that there may be security reasons for the Minister not wishing to say too much about the particular work or the particular expected future workloads at the ordnance factories. I shall not describe what goes on at the Royal Ordnance Factory at Bridgwater, because I think that an element of this is confidential and I do not think it would be proper to give details.<br><br>
However, I would have thought that it would be important at this time to give some indication of the probable future workload of the ROFs as a whole. It is expected that the present workload will continue and the sort of activity level be much as at present? It has been a very urbane discussion so far, but do these sinister political undertones of the Defence Review have even more sinister overtones for the activities of the Royal Ordnance Factories, and can the Minister say what the the prospects in any cutback on defence expenditure for employment in the ordnance factories?<br><br>
I appreciate also that it is not purely a domestic matter; there is, as the Minister has said, production for overseas Governments as well going on in British ordnance factories. It is possible that there are export opportunities to replace any domestic reductions. In that respect there is another political factor, whether we are to be yet more selective about the Governments and countries for which we are prepared to produce ordnance products. A number of the ordnance products are not munitions in the accepted sense of the word. I am thinking of certain fuels which have space implications. This obviously is another area in which there is future potential. All this adds up to a concern which I should be interested
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0537">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
if the Minister can answer. I know that my constituents would be very keen to know what their prospects are and the likely pattern of work.<br><br>
There is one further aspect of this more independent management operation to which I referred a little earlier. This is a Category 1 operation. What is the position under price controls? This activity is at times in competition with other companies—ICI is one example of the sort of organisation with which the ordnance factories might be in competition—which are subject to Category 1 price pre-notification. Will the ordnance factories, as a result of this partial hiving-off, be in any sense treated in the same way, and will they be required to submit any increases, both for internal Government work and external contracts, to the Price Commission?<br><br>
These are essential points—the reassurance about the position of individuals, the best information that can be given about their future prospects, and the need to communicate to everybody the real significance and importance of this move. I say one thing perfectly genuinely, about people who are my friends on the shop floor and in the management of these activities: this move is needed. These activities need to feel and act in a more commercial and independent way. The responsibility needs to be placed very squarely on the managements, both the central management and, I hope, by a good delegation of autonomy to the management in the individual factories. It is vital, particularly in the present situation, that people recognise that they must act in an independent commercial way and will be acountable for their performance. That important factor must be got across to everybody.<br><br>
Having said that, I think it would be quite wrong to pass this Order without recognising the important, but also dangerous, work that many of these people do. There have been tragedies at Bridgwater, fortunately not in the immediate past years, but in the history of this factory there have been, very sadly, a number of deaths. There have been explosions; they are a constant reminder of the dangerous and difficult work which is done in many of the departments. It is all the more reason to ensure that people involved in it are engaged in a fair, proper, commercial
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
way, on terms that are comparable to those available in outside and local industry—that their efforts are rewarded and that they have the opportunity to give of their best and perform in a thoroughly effective and properly managed way<br><br>
These are my thoughts, as a Member with an ordnance factory in his constituency, and my reasons for believing that it is important to discuss this Order and to recognise its significance as the first of what may well be many of similar significance. I hope the Minister can reassure the people employed in these factories and answer my specific questions on a very important activity under his responsibility.</span></p>
<p>10.58 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dudley Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like briefly to echo some of the sentiments of my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgwater (Mr. King), particularly on the point that this really must mean something; that it is not merely a technical change but that it will be a change for the good and for the greater efficiency of the Royal Ordnance Factories and also for the Ministry of Defence. If this is properly implemented, I am sure that there will be better accountability under a trading fund system. Therefore, the performances of the factories could significantly be improved over a period of time.<br><br>
Also a great sense of efficiency will be created for the staffs of these factories, to whom my hon. Friend referred, and those who work under the umbrella of these factories. Undoubtedly there has been a good record in the past. One has heard comparatively few criticisms of the factories, but everyone is capable of a better performance, and I hope that the relevance of the kind of extra incentives which the Order brings about will be seen in due course.<br><br>
One appropriate point was brought up by my hon. Friend who, with his usual assiduousness is here today to speak up because he happens to have an ordnance factory in his constituency. I imagine—although he chided some hon. Members for not being here to take this opportunity—that many Members of the House who have such factories in their constituencies did not know that they could come to this Committee today to speak with a constituency interest. From
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0538">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
experience of more than 13 years' association with this House; it is imbued in one's mind that one never turns up at a Standing Committee unless one is appointed to it; one would soon get thrown out if one tried to speak. I am certain that, with the large influx of new Members that we have had in the past few months there are many who do not realize—as I certainly did not—that any hon. Member could come here this morning to speak on this important subject.<br><br>
There seems to be some lack of communication. A great deal goes on in this place, and unless one delves very deeply it is not always possible to know exactly what Committees one is entitled to attend and to speak in. I do not know who might be responsible but I hope that when these draft Instruments or other measures akin to them come before the House, there could be some better kind of notification to hon. Members to give them the opportunity to participate.<br><br>
I am here this morning only because I found myself appointed to this Committee, with all the authority, I imagine, of one who has spent four weeks in the Ministry of Defence and who was due to visit the ordnance factory at Enfield on the very day of the General Election. Perhaps there will be an opportunity in future, with other Statutory Instruments, of communicating to hon. Members the fact that they can participate. In echoing what my hon. Friend said, I thank the Minister for his logical explanation. We hope that the change to be effected will be a significant change for the better.</span></p>
<p>11.0 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rodgers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to have the opportunity of replying to some of the points made by the hon. Member for Bridgwater (Mr. King). I commend his ingenuity in coming, and the more so, as the hon. Member for Warwick and Leamington (Mr. Smith) pointed out, since the very existence of this Committee—with no disrespect to your distinguished Chairmanship Mr. Davies—is hidden from many Members of the House. The enterprise of the hon. Gentleman in turning up was measured by the little ripple of consternation about why he was here at all, and what should be done about him. When I reviewed the membership of the Committee and spent hours deciding how I should reply to constitu-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
ency points, the one thing which I did not do was to assume that the hon. Member for Bridgwater would come along. So his ingenuity is matched by my failure to understand the workings of our parliamentary procedures.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman made an important point when he emphasised that this is a huge enterprise, employing 18,000 men and women. It is not only desirable but right that the House should show a greater interest in the organisation than hitherto. We often talk about public accountability, but public accountability requires parliamentary participation. In the absence of the latter, whatever Orders of this kind contain, too many people remain sovereign. Although Ministers like not to be asked awkward questions, in the end it is for the strength of our system and for the efficiency of enterprises of this kind that they should be asked. I greatly welcome, therefore, what the hon. Gentleman said.<br><br>
I confirm that it will still be possible to put down Questions about the Royal Ordnance Factories and that the annual report and accounts will be published and available to Parliament. I shall be looking eagerly to the time when the hon. Member asks the Leader of the House on a Thursday afternoon which day the following week will be given to the debate. I expect that the reply will be, "Not next week, S;r". Nevertheless, if he persists, no doubt time will be found and, speaking for myself, I shall greatly welcome it.<br><br>
I am glad that the hon. Member for Bridgwater made two further points. Although the Royal Ordnance Factories are not hived off, even in part, there is an important change in introducing this formula of a trading fund, while at the same time the rights of individual employees of Royal Ordnance Factories are not affected in any way. We have already kept the trade union and staff side fully informed of our proposals, but I give an assurance that, when this Order has been through this Committee and through the House, we shall take further steps to make clear how far there has been a change of status, while at the same time rights have not been affected, from the beginning of July.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. King</span><span class='membercontribution'>: While I appreciate that there have been full discussions with the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0539">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
trade union and staff side, I hope that it is intended to do something direct with every individual, in the form of a fairly simple note in the pay packet or something along these lines. We all know that staff sides and unions are not always the most perfect channel of communication. Stories can become a little distorted. Because of the impact that one is seeking here, it is important to get through to every individual employee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ernest G. Perry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman raises an interesting matter. Will the Minister ensure that, if a note or letter is put in the pay packet, consultation goes on with union representatives to ensure that there is no comeback afterwards that there was no proper consultation? I am sure that there is a particular union procedure catering for this sort of work.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rodgers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for confirming what the hon. Member for Bridgwater proposes. There has been very full consultation, but, clearly, it would have been inappropriate to anticipate the decision of Parliament.<br><br>
When Parliament has made its decision, we shall consider the matter further. My only thought is that if I received in my pay packet a note assuring me that everything was unchanged, I would immediately rush off to ask what had been changed which required the reassurance. It is a matter of judgment, but certainly I shall examine it as we all wish to see the changes, such as they are, fully understood by those most closely affected by them.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman referred to the difficulties at Bridgwater. I should be happy to follow up any further points following our previous discussions. As he knows, there have been some serious problems in the ROFs arising from pay policies and particularly from stage 3.<br><br>
We have lately been having further negotiations with the staff side and the unions, and I hope very much that a satisfactory 'settlement will be found. I appreciate that it has been a period of strain for some and that pay rates often seem much too low. It is desirable to help the lower paid workers as far as possible, while at the same time enabling
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
the Royal Ordnance Factories competitively to retain the very high craftsmen skills upon which they so largely depend. There have been special problems of productivity agreements, and Bridgwater is not the only Royal Ordnance Factory to have been affected, although it has certain special features.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. King</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for intervening again, but I am particularly interested in this subject. How far does what he has just said about continuing discussions imply a change in the situation from the letter that he wrote to me on 13th May when he said that it was hoped 'to change the situation from 1st July? Are these discussions still proceeding and is it hoped to resolve the matter along the sort of lines he hoped, which will then be retrospective to 1st July. Does 1st July still hold as the date?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rodgers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is no change in the fundamental situation as I described it to the hon. Gentleman. We said 1st July because that is the deadline on stage 3. There are two different elements: first, what is possible within stage 3, and negotiations have been continuing on that; secondly, what makes best sense and is negotiable after 1st July. On the first of these elements, up to 1st July; negotiations have now gone a long way, but I should be reluctant to say anything in this Committee which could prejudice the final stage of negotiations. I should be happy to talk to the hon. Gentleman, or any other members of the Committee, afterwards to make precisely clear where we now stand. If there are any changes affecting Bridgwater which change the circumstances of our previous discussion, I shall certainly let the hon. Gentleman know.<br><br>
I can give the hon. Gentleman the assurances that he asks on prices. The price control do not apply to internal work for the MOD, or for export, but the spirit of the Price Code is very much in our minds, because, as I said in my opening remarks and as was made clear when the original legislation went through the House, we are determined to ensure that the ROFs, although their main job is catering for the needs of the Defence Department, are not put in an unfair competitive position, either way, with private industry.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
As for the prospects of the Royal Ordance Factories; the current order book is something over £200 million. Certainly I have no reason to believe that they will not be able to provide a high level of security and opportunity for many years ahead. As the hon. Gentleman and the Committee know, whereas I should not like the Defence Review to go on record as being in any way sinister—it is open and plain—until the Defence Review is completed it is impossible to anticipate the requirements for equipment in the years ahead.<br><br>
As I said earlier, it has been the practice that, in so far as there is any surplus in the Royal Ordnance Factories, the surplus should be taken up more often than not in sub-contracting work for other defence industries. If this principle is followed successfully in future, we can promise a secure and, I hope, worthwhile job to the staff of the Royal Ordnance Factories, to which the hon. Gentleman has paid a tribute with which
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
I am sure the whole Committee would wish to be associated.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. King</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister also answer the quasi-political question about exports? Are there any exports that may be threatened by any views of the political structure, or the nature of the country's involvement?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rodgers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not aware at the moment that any work is currently in the Royal Ordnance Factories or anticipated for them that is likely to be affected by any of the considerations that I suppose the hon. Gentleman has in mind. If I prove to be wrong, I shall certainly let him know.</span></p>
