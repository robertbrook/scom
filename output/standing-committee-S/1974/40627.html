	<div class='title'>ELECTRICITY PRICES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee have considered
	<div class='ul'>
	<li>Class IV, Vote 17, Trade and Industry and Employment (Scottish Economic Planning Department), and</li>
	<li>Class XIII, Vote 23, Other Services (Scottish Office)â€”[	<i>Mr. Malan.</i>]</li></div> <!-- ul --></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Russell Fairgrieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is with mixed feelings that I open this first Scottish Estimates debate of this Parliament on electricity prices. I have a sense of pleasure mixed with humility that my colleagues have seen fit to ask me to open this debate from the Front Bench so early in my career in Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to discuss electricity prices in a more general way and I shall try not to be too fractious politically, though I have no doubt that some of the things 1 may say may not find absolute agreement on the benches opposite or even from some hon. Members on this side of the Committee. I shall try to be constructive rather than destructive, because I have spent over 20 years in competitive manufacturing industry, competitive both within this country and without. I shall look not just at electricity prices today but at electricity prices yesterday, today and tomorrow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that this industry was nationalised in 1948, and since that date it has been the duty of both parties to make it work efficiently. If there have been faults of omission or commission there have been faults on both sides. Both parties are responsible for the capital debt that has built up in this industry. I believeâ€”and this applies not only to electricity but to other industriesâ€”that we in this country must learn to live with, and operate efficiently, a mixed economy. There are extremists on both sides. We cannot go back to the Manchester School or
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
Economists of the last century and complete 	<i>laissez-faire,</i> nor can we go forward to the complete implementation of clause 4, as asked for by extremists on the other side. Therefore, we in this country must live and work with a mixed economy. In my opinion, at the present moment we are just about right. Too much more to private enterprise or too much more into nationalisation would be a mistake on both sides. As far as I am concerned, for Scotland particularly, the foolery of Bennery would be an absolute disaster.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I now turn to how I see us, both parties, running this industry efficiently. When the political decision is taken, politics must go out of it, and we roust start looking at it industrially, commercially. The first thing lacking in this industry, as in some other nationalised industries, is competition. Whether we like it or not, it is competition that keeps industry efficient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us look at it in another way. In Scotland at the moment, there is nothing so topical as football and the way that our country has performed in the World Cup. Can one imagine the Scottish League if there were no competition? Where would Hearts, Rangers, Celtic and the Dons be if we were not allowed competition, or a First Division? That is why I say that we wish to bring competition into these industries; otherwise we go to the convoy system, which means that we all move at the speed of the slowest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are some of the ways of bringing competition into this industry? One simple, known method in the private sector of industry, or large conglomerates, is inter-firm comparison. There are 12 area boards in England and Wales, and two in Scotland. If these were made to subject themselves to the budgetary disciplines of inter-firm comparison, we could do something about the less efficient. If we could compare unit costs and look at the labour employment from one board to another, this would be the way to bring up the laggards to the efficiency of the best.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another suggestion applies not only to electricity, but also to gas and transport. These nationalised industries have a duty. In the case of electricity, it is to produce electricity and take it to the point of distribution. The industry should not engage in periphery activities like retailing electric fires or competing with firms for estimates for wiring domestic
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0224">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
houses. These are not the jobs of a nationalised board. Its duty is to produce electricity and take it to the point of distribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the consumers, because they are very much affected by electricity prices. Who are the consumers of electricity? They comprise virtually the whole of our country. This includes pensioners, retired people, the old, and schoolchildren. They are all consumers of electricity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I shall shortly speak of different types of fuel that can be used for electricity, I should like to mention one at the moment, because it will become topical, and that is coal. We are seeing the possibility of a serious rise in the price of coal. I think it was a member of the party opposite who said, "One man's wage increase is another man's price increase". If Mr. McGahey gets the Â£5,000 a year miner on four days a week, this is bound to affect electricity prices. If there is to be a social contract between the unions and the Labour Party, might this social contract be widened to include the categories of people I have mentioned â€”pensioners, schoolchildren, the old, the infirm, the retired and those on fixed incomes?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are the fuels that are used for electricity? I have mentioned coal. There are also gas, hydro, thermo and nuclear. In another century there could be solar and tidal. In the meantime we must have a fuel policy that mixes the use of them all, so that we do not rely too heavily on one fuel. We have five possible fuels and we should power some of our stations on one fuel and some on another, and also make them convertible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the same time, having got a balance of fuel use in this industry, may I make another point which I think worthy of consideration in the long term. As we see oil coming on stream throughout Britain, we must realise that it is probably correct that there should be one price for oil. The time has now arrived when we should consider the possibility of one price for electricity throughout the country. That is sensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tried to widen the subject and to throw out ideas for the future efficient running of the industry, which is the responsibility of both parties, in the years ahead. In Scotland, I wish to see it
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
efficient and competitive. The Leader of the Labour Party mentioned the electoral difficulty of Marks and Spencer being run like the Co-op. May I say something in defence of the Co-op. It does not give me any pleasure to talk about any Scottish institution as inefficient. Therefore, I hope that some of the ideas that are being thrown up will be put into practice, enabling us to proud be of the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board and the South of Scotland Electricity Board, so that when the league of 14 that I have mentioned is printed, these two teams will be at the top and will remain there, and it will be a source of pride to Scotland that our two electricity authorities are efficient, active and competitive in the interests of the consumers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Mr. Bruce Millan)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I start by congratulating the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Fairgrieve) on his Front Bench debut. Much of what he has said is extremely interesting and I hope to take up one or two of his points. I must say, however, that I understand that the issue of the debate was specifically electricity prices, and that we were to be talking about the price increases that have just been announced by the electricity boards. The hon. Gentleman did not say a great deal that was relevant to the changes in electricity prices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Next Wednesday, Sir Myer, we shall have the opportunity of discussing electricity board borrowing in Scotland on the basis of an Order which we shall be debating in this Committee. I shall be happy then to take up some sort of the broader issues mentioned by the hon. Gentleman. Today however, I shall confine myself to the question of electricity prices and tariffs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to make one comment, however, on what the hon. Gentleman said about the need for competition. First, there is considerable competition between the fuel industries themselvesâ€” between electricity gas, oil and solid fuel. Secondly, it seems to me slightly odd to say that there should be more competition in the electricity boards and then immediately thereafter to say that the electricity boards should not be involved in selling appliances and installing them. I should have thought that that provided a happy degree of competition for private industry in this
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0225">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
sphere. I am in favour of that kind of competition, because the electricity boards in these areas do a very good job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the question of electricity prices. I am not surprised that the hon. Gentleman did not deal with them in detail after the roasting that his right hon. Friend the former Minister of Energy received in the House last Thursday from my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Energy. The debate today was chosen by the Opposition on this specific subject, because they wanted to make political capital out of the electricity price increases and particularly out of the controversy over the increase in off-peak tariff. I shall deal in detail with the background to the increases and particularly with the off-peak tariff problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I start by making the point that the processes for making the increases generally started before the last election. They were started by the previous Government. This does not refer merely to the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the previous Government; it includes the Secretary of State for Energy in the previous Government and Scottish Office Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I say with every sincerity that I am delighted to see the hon. Gentleman on the Front Bench this morning and I enjoyed his speech, as I think the Committee did, it might have been more honest with the Committee if we had had at some point in the debate one of the former Scottish Office Ministers opening or closing from the other side. I understand that the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) is winding up. We know that he is not a former Scottish Office Minister. Some of us regret it a little, if I may say so, but he is not, and he does not bear any direct responsibility for what happened under the previous Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) is sitting quietly there today, as is the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor). Could they not have spoken about electricity price increases? We hear the hon. Member for Cathcart speaking about everything else. I should have thought we could have had his views about electricity price increases this morning. As regards the increases about which they are complaining now and about which they have made a great deal of fuss, the processes for introducing them started under the previous Government. That is the reason for
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
the undue diffidence on the part of some of the hon. Gentlemen opposite in taking part in the debate today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Teddy Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the Minister explain precisely what he is saying?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Milan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am saying that the statement by the Chancellor of the Exchequer last Decemberâ€”1 see the hon.

There is no doubt about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For his speech to have a greater sense of accuracy, I think the hon. Gentleman should recall that the burden of the Opposition's case during the last week was not the increases themselves, but the way in which the Government had agreed to overload the increase for night storage heating in England and Wales particularly. It was a confidence trick on the public who had invested their money in this installation. It was a great triumph for common sense and for the Opposition that the Government gave way and reversed the policy in the last minutes of the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr, Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to these matters in very considerable detail, and I will then demonstrate the inaccuracy of what the hon. Gentleman has just said, in its relation to Scotland in particular.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The general background to thisâ€”[	<i>Interruption.</i>]â€”I assume that the Opposition, choosing the subject of electricity prices for today's first estimates debate, must have had in mind that we wanted to talk about electricity prices in Scotland and the off-peak electricity prices in particular. If they are saying now that they do not want to talk about this, we are all here under a

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Steel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The choice of subject for debate has nothing to do with the Chair. Perhaps Members would like to widen the debate slightly, but as long as they return to the subject of electricity charges they are quite in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order. It is not a fact that we are discussing the estimates and not a subject? If the subject that an hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the hon. Member is quite right. What is important to the Committee is the question of estimates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order. If the Minister has been stupid enough to prepare and circulate a speech replying to an argument which is not made, surely he is perfectly at liberty not to make that speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Milan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There seems to be some reluctance on the opposite side of the Committee to allow me to talk about electricity prices, but I have every intention of doing so since the subject of this morning's debate was chosen, as is our normal custom, by the Opposition, and not by the Government. The Opposition, chose electricity prices because presumably â€”they wanted to say something nasty about the Government on electricity prices, and I am going to deal with electricity prices. I have not circulated my
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
speech to anybody, unlike the hon. Member for Cathcart who is well-known for his instant quotations and circulation of notes of speeches on practically every subject under the sun.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will carry on dealing with the question of electricity prices. The first thing is that basically the fixing of electricity prices is for the electricity boards themselves, but this is subject to the important restrictionâ€”again introduced by hon. Gentlemen opposite under the counter-inflationary legislationâ€”that there is power on the part of the Secretary of State, a power that we have inherited under paragraph 85 of the Price Code, to restrict price increases which would otherwise be justified. That restriction is confined to restricting the price increases to no less than the allowable cost increases as provided for by the Price Code. That, as I shall explain in a moment, is exactly what has happened in this case, as the increases that have taken place are less than the price increases that would have been allowed by the Price Code laid down by hon. Gentlemen opposite when in government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a protection for the consumer in the fact that the consultative councils are able to make representations to the Secretary of State, but, so far as this particular price increase is concerned, neither the North nor the South Consultative Council has made any representations to the Secretary of State. When the price increases are restrictedâ€”that is, when the electricity boards are not allowed to increase their prices sufficiently to balance their books, which is their general statutory duty in normal circumstancesâ€”there is provision for financial compensation. Again, that is provided for under the Statutory Corporations (Financial Provisions) Act introduced by hon. Gentlemen opposite. Already under that provision which quite deliberately puts the burden of any loss of income straight on to the taxpayer, we have already paid considerable sums of money up to 31st March 1973, and we shall be laying an Order very soon specifying compensation of Â£13 million in respect of the year 1973â€“74.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. J. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether this is the right time to raise this point, but I hope that during the course of his remarks the Minister of State or his hon. and learned Friend the Lord Advocate will be able to tell us
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0227">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
what is the Government's estimate of the scale of subsidisation which will be required under the Statutory Corporations Financial Provisions Act, probably in relation to increase in prices.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Milan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not able to give a precise figure because that can only be determined at the end of the year in accordance with the Act. However, I would say that on current expectations, the subsidy for 1974â€“75 will be higher than the subsidy for 1973â€“74. Therefore, the Government, in terms of keeping prices down, will be subsidising electricity consumers in Scotland in the current year at a higher level than they were subsidised during the previous year. It is being done, as I have already indicated under legislation which we inherited from the previous Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was in the light of that kind of statutory background that the electricity boards in Scotland restricted the recent price increases, in the case of the North Board to 26 per cent. and in the case of the South Board to 29 per cent. If it had been necessary and had been considered desirable for those boards to balance their books completely, those increases would have been substantially greater. However, they were restricted to those figures with the help and expectation of what will be a bigger Government subsidy for electricity in Scotland in the current year than we had last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far as the costs are concerned in terms of efficiency and so on, the costs were scrutinised by the Price Commission and no increase would have been allowed by the Price Commission unless the boards had been able to demonstrate that the costs had gone up correspondingly. The major cost is basically the cost of fuel, because oil prices have trebled over the last year and that has to be reflected somewhere, either in higher prices or higher subsidies from the taxpayer. Since 1st April this year the boards have been paying 32 per cent. more for coal, and 65 per cent. of Scottish electricity is generated from coal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, it was unavoidable that there would be large increases in electricity prices this year. It is not pleasant for the Government that there should be those large electricity price increases, and it is particularly unpleasant for the consumer. The fact is that they arise directly from increases in fuel prices and from other
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
increases in costs about which the electricity boards are able to do nothing. In terms of the legislation which we inherited from the previous Government, in the current year we shall subsidise electricity consumers in Scotland to a greater extent than was done during 1973â€“74 or any earlier year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us now put on record the facts about the off-peak tariffs in Scotland. I have had many letters from members of Parliament and others protesting about the 70 per cent. increase in off-peak tariffs in Scotland. There has been no 70 per cent. increase in off-peak tariffs in Scotland. I will explain what the figures are in a moment. That has happened in England, but not is Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, one must remember that the increases in off-peak tariffs in Scotland reflect the increases in the basic fuel prices. They are the same for off-peak as for other domestic consumers. If the price of basic fuel goes up, there is a considerable argument thet every consumer should bear the same increase in unit prices. This is achieved in England by fuel adjustment clauses, which do that automatically. There are no fuel adjustment clauses in Scotland, under either in the south or in the north boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The North Board has increased all its tariffs by 0.25 pence per unit. It has made the same adjustment for everybody. In percentage terms that means that the figures have gone up more for off-peak consumption than for normal domestic consumption, but the monetary advantage of off-peak consumption is still fully maintained in the North of Scotland Hydro-Electricity Board area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The South Board has increased its off-peak tariffs by less than the increase for the normal domestic tariff, although, as I say, there would have been justification in strict economic terms for making a similar increase to off-peak as to normal domestic tariffs. But the margin between off-peak charges and normal domestic charges in the South Board area has not only been maintained but actually widened by the way in which the increases have taken place in their area. Nevertheless, when one converts these into percentage termsâ€”and I shall come to percentages in a minute â€”one gets higher increases in the off-peak tariffs than in the normal domestic tariffs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I give some of these figures, let me make another point clear. The Scottish boards have never, literally never,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0228">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
advertised half-price electricity. These advertisements have appeared in English newspapers, and, no doubt, in newspapers circulating in Scotland from English electricity boards. But there has never been a commitment by the Scottish electricity boards to half-price electricity in Scotland. In most cases, as I shall demonstrate in a minute, there was not half-price electricity in Scotland before the last increase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that people who have read the English advertisements, not merely recently but perhaps over the years, can have been misled into feeling that off-peak tariffs in Scotland were being offered at half-price rates. It is because I believe that there is this feeling of injustice that we want to make adjustments in Scotland as well. But the situation is that there was never any commitment on the boards in Scotland to half-price electricity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make the point to the Minister that we on this side of the Committee have never said that this debate was about off-peak prices. That was a debate in Parliament when Members on this side forced the Government to change their plans for these increases. This debate is about the burden of all electricity prices on consumers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I have already dealt with general price increases, and I intend to deal with off-peak tariffs, because I have received many letters about them, including letters from hon. Gentlemen opposite. I understood that that was what we were supposed to be talking about this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When one looks at the off-peak tariffs in the South or the North of Scotland Electricity Boards, one finds first a variety of tariffs and it is difficult to make generalised remarks. Secondly, the most common tariffs in Scotland include a mid-day or a daytime boost, and therefore few consumers in Scotland are on a tariff which is simply an off-peak all-night tariff. Virtually all the consumers on off-peak tariffs are on tariffs providing for a mid-day boost. I do not know what the situation is in the 12 electricity boards in Englandâ€”I am not responsible for themâ€”but I am talking about the Scottish situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think the correct comparison to make is the off-peak tariffâ€”that is to say, the
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
run-on rate at which one gets the units after the standard unitsâ€”and the standard tariff. The figures for South Board are these. There are two main off-peak tariffs under which the bulk of domestic consumers receive their supply. One of these has risen from 62.6 per cent. of the normal domestic tariff to 65.1 per cent., which is marginal and nothing like the increase that has taken place in England. The other off-peak tariff has risen from 68 per cent. of the standard tariff to 71 per cent. Again it is not comparable with what has happened in England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far as the hydro-Board is concerned, of the two tariffs most used by domestic consumers, one has risen from 61 per cent. to 70 per cent., but it was never at 50 per cent. or anything like it. The others has risen from 72 per cent. to 79 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The percentage which the off-peak tariffs in Scotland bear to the normal domestic tariff has never been stable. It has varied over the years as tariffs have been adjusted. One of the popular tariffs in the North, the off-peak unit rate, has varied over the years from 69 per cent. â€”it has not been lower than that--to 90 per cent. So there has never been half-price electricity under off-peak tariffs in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, the position in Scotland is extremely complex and not at all comparable with the position in Englandâ€”though that is also complex. Nevertheless consumers in Scotland feel, as do consumers in Englandâ€”whether justifiably or notâ€”that they have borne a disproportionate burden. It is true, of course, despite the figures that I have given, that the off-peak tariff went up by a higher percentage in Scotland than did the ordinary domestic tariff. In view of that I repeat the assurance that was given last week: that we wish to see adjustments made in Scotland in the same way as adjustments are to be made in England. But they will not and cannot be the same as the adjustments that will have to be made in England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly we shall have to discuss this matter with the electricity boards. I have already had a conversation about this with the Chairman of the North of Scotland Board within the last two or three days. I am not able to say anything more at this stage because we have to discuss it with the boards in some detail and we also have to consider the relationship between what happens in the North
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0229">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
Board area and whet happens in the South Board area if only because most of the off-peak supplies come from the same power station. The base load Long-gannet power station in Fife supplies most of the base night-time load to the North of Scotland area as well as to the South of Scotland area, which is another complicating factor. But the simplest way to deal with the difficulty may be to restore the new off-peak tariffs to the same percentage of the normal domestic tariff as they were before the latest price increases. That may be the simplest way of doing it, but "simple" should be in inverted commas because even that is a complicated arrangement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I give the pledge, however, that we shall consider what adjustments should be made to remove the sense of grievance which many off-peak consumers feel. I make that absolute commitment. The cost of thisâ€”and I cannot estimate it nowâ€”will be borne by the Government and by the taxpayer. As soon as we have this information, we shall let the House know what we have decided and what the cost will be to the taxpayer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman make it clear that this subsidy from the taxpayers will be over and above those which will be payable under the Statutory Corporations Financial Provisions Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I think that it will be paid under the same statute, but it will be over and above, because under the Bill the deficits at the end of the year will be met by the taxpayer. If we increase the deficits, we increase the subsidy from the taxpayer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having made this adjuctment, we should make it absolutely clear to Scottish consumers, once and for all, that there has never been half-price electricity, and there can be no commitment, even after this adjustment, that off-peak tarriffs will be maintained at any particular percentage of the normal domestic tariffs. I think it would be quite wrong and misleading to give anyone the impression that we could do this. These tariffs must be allowed to be varied in the future, depending on genuine cost increases having to be borne by the board. That has been the position in the past, and that is the position to which we shall revert after making the adjustments which we shall make to meet this difficulty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Gentleman raised. I may pick up one or two of these when winding up. I shall be glad to deal with all these important issues, as I admit they are, when we debate the Order next week. I think it was absolutely right that we should get the matter of tariffs put straight as far as Scotland is concerned. I hope I have now done that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.9 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I begin by congratulating the hon. Member for Aberdeen-shire, West (Mr. Fairgrieve) on his first speech from the Front Bench. Although I must confess, as the Minister did, to some regret at the form it took, it was a very interesting speech and raised some excellent points. I had expected the Opposition, or at least the Conservative Opposition, to go into the ring with the Minister and give him an upper cut, but all we had was a dissertation on boxing down the ages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Conservative Opposition have not got to the state of mind of the famous boxer, Mr. Joe Louis, who joined the American forces in 1940. He was asked by a reporter, "Mr. Louis, why are you joining the American Army?" and he said, "My fighting days are over" That would appear to me to be the spirit in which the Conservative Opposition have entered this debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West raised the question of nationalised industries engaging in the retail business, and so on. Whether that is a sound idea, given their instructions to make their industries pay, is a moot point. One of the greatest drawbacks of these industriesâ€”without going into the argument of whether they should be nationalisedâ€” is that they were taken out of the control of Parliament. They are run by appointees of the Secretary of State of the day, and Parliament has very little control over them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to be fair, particularly to the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board. The Minister made great play of the fact that, unlike the 70 per cent. south of the border, the increases in Scotland are 26 per cent. for the North, and 29 per cent.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0230">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
for the South Board. In the context of the 70 per cent. that looks fairly reasonable and it seems that we are getting away with something, but would we not regard 26 per cent.â€”over a quarterâ€”and 29 per cent.â€”nearly a thirdâ€”as appalling increases in normal times?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It cannot be based on the price of fuel as far as the North Board is concerned, because 40 per cent. of it is produced from hydro power. The board flooded glens and damaged agriculture and amenity to some extentâ€”although I agree that a sheet of water of itself is often an improvement to the landscapeâ€”but it did some damage in the north, and it excused that on the ground that this was to provide cheaper electricity for the people in the area, but that did not come about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact that off-peak, or half-price electricity was never offered is taken by the Minister to be a defence. It seems to me utterly ridiculous. If half price electricity was offered in England and not in Scotland, the Minister or his Conservative predecessor should have asked why that was done. Why was the concession available south of the border and not in Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a simple answer to that. These decisions were left to the Scottish boards, which decided otherwise. I thought that the hon. Gentleman would welcome decision-making being devolved to Scotland in that way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whether the decision is made by Scottish boards, English boards or by anyone else, no one welcomes the decision to have a facility that is not available to himself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>An hon. Member</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the price of devolution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister should see that the North Board lives up to its remit, both in the basic price and in the price of the off-peak heaters. It is all very well saying that the price was not offered north of the border. These papers are circulating all over the country. People were under the impression when they bought the heaters that they would have cheap electricity, whenever the prices went up. The heaters were purchased on a wide scale in that belief. It was up to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
Minister to back the efforts being made to see that the prices were kept at a reasonable level.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had the statement that the profitable part of the electricity boards should be hived off, that one should have the facility to hive off that commercial undertaking which sells cookers, and so on. This thinking is typical of the Opposition. We hear about a mixed economy. The view that society must provide a subsidy so that the profit-making part of an industry can continue to make a profit is welcome to the Opposition, but it is not welcome to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regard electricity as a social privilege, in the same way as one could regard pavements as a social privilege. One does not pay every time one walks along the road, and my view is that electricity should be supported by the Exchequer, in the same way as it supports other social services.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Selby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Since the Opposition introduced politics, I am inclined to give a political dissertation. Why do other parties not propose the abolition of money altogether? We are living in a society that is motivated entirely by profit-making, and all the opposition's thinking is determined by how much they can obtain from the Exchequer. They would make a profit at our expense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We heard a speech by a Minister which produced a demonstration regarding the nationalisation of one-shipbuilding company. I am willing to bet that, to save the fall the Opposition when that company is put on its feet the profitable part of it, just as with Rolls-Royce, will be handed back to private enterprise. That is happening here today. The Opposition are demanding that we subsidise electricity and hand back the profit-making part of the industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.20 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Fairgrieve) on his splendid speech, and I say to the hon. Gentleman for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Selby) how delighted we were to hear him again. His contributions are indeed unusual and interesting. In the last debate he was calling for the abolition of interest charges in housing, and now we have the proposal for free electricity. This is a radical proposal, though I doubt whether it has the general support of the Labour Party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should declare interest, as I have the SSEB headquarters in my constituency. It was unfortunate that the Minister came here with a prepared speech to answer attacks that were not made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think the hon. Gentleman will find that throughout debate on electricity last week a specific proposal was put forward by the Opposition saying that we objected strongly to the 70 per cent. increase in night storage charges that was being opposed in England and Wales. Happily, because of the strength or our arguments, the Government gave way and accepted our argument, wholeheartedly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
The Minister may remember that at the end of the debate my hon. Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) asked what would be the position in Scotland; whether there would be any change in the increases that we had had particularly in the case of the North Board where there appeared to be a more substantial percentage increase in the night storage charges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister gave assurance today that something will be done along these lines, and this is very useful, but I feel that the Minister wasted the time of the Committee using his speech with answering arguments that were not put to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far as the general increase is concerned, the Minister is right in saying that it was accepted by the Chancellor in his statement last year that prices would have to be adjusted. The Minister will know that conflicting advice was given to us. The Government took the view that, for a long period of time, there was a justification for subsidising the electricity boards and keeping prices down as a contribution towards our counter-inflation policy. There were some, such as my hon. Friend the Member for South Angus (Mr. Bruce-Gardyne), who felt that that was foolish and that we should charge the full economic cost a t all times. The Minister will, however, be aware that we certainly did subsidise the boards as a matter of deliberate policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to speak on electricity prices today, and I hope that the Minister will answer some of the real questions that I shall ask him. First, can the Minister say whether it is the policy of the Government, and will be the continued policy of the boards, to continue to be so dependent on coal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously, coal has a significant impact on electricity prices in Scotland, particularly because the general level of coal prices in Scotland is considerably higher than in other areas of Great Britain. There is no doubt that 65 per cent. is a high figure. I was very worried when on my way to the Committee, I read on the tapes that coal stocks are down to an all-time low and that production in the pits has slumped disastrously. It appears that Mr. McGahey and his friends, who are demanding massive pay rises at the end of the year, will be in a stronger position than ever before to hold the country to ransom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0232">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
It is a fact that we shall face a severe situation towards the end of the year and we must face the possibility of substantial rises in coal prises once again. I therefore ask the Minister, bearing in mind the importance of reducing prices wherever possible, whether it is wise to be so dependent on coal, and whether this will be a continuing policy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know about all the collieries in Cathcart, but at Polkemmet and Kinneil production has not slumped. On the contrary, production figures are rather good in the east of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to hear that, and I hope that the zeal which the hon. Gentleman has obviously passed on to his mining constituents will spread throughout the country, but a report issued a fortnight ago by the coal board shows that production per man had been reduced since the last strike. If the hon. Gentleman looks at the report he will see that there has been a further reduction, and that coal stocks are described as being "alarmingly low" because of this reduction in output. I am not saying that this is happening in every pit, but it is certainly happening in the country as a whole and creating a serious situation, and that should make us question whether 65 per cent, is the right percentage for dependence on coal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, we, as a Committee, must face the fact that, irrespective of what the Government do, irrespective of what the miners do, and irrespective of what the Arabs do, electricity prices will certainly continue to rise. We know that many people who used to consider electricity bills as matters of Â£6, Â£10 or Â£12 are finding themselves faced with quarterly bills of as much as Â£40, Â£50 and more. Those of us who hold surgeries will be aware of individuals who are extremely worried about the level of their electricity bills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the Minister and the board have to do is to bear in mind the fact that, inevitably, irrespective of which party is in power, we shall have very large quarterly bills which some people who do not have access to standing orders, bank accounts and budgeting facilities will not be able to
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
pay. Can they find easier ways by which electricity bills can be paid?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is now more difficult for most people to pay for their electricity. People in the older areas who used to have electricity meters, which resulted in their getting a repayment at the end of the quarter when the meter man called, are now finding that because they have credit meters they have substantial bills to pay each quarter. We know that it is the general policy of the boards, for understandable reasons, gradually to eliminate pre-payment meters. For those who find difficulty in paying, electricity bills are becoming more of a problem than ever.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have seen in the stamp scheme brought forward by the SSEB, the desire on the part of the public to find easier ways of paying. Although it is helpful to people in budgeting for their bills, the stamp scheme is not a very good bargain for them because they are paying in advance and providing useful capital to the boards. They do not get any benefit by buying stamps, apart from the fact that they have money which can be used only for electricity bills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to put a suggestion to the Minister which I hope will be helpful. Could there be a scheme to encourage people to buy stamps or Â£1 electricity certificates whereby, if they did that in advance, they would get some credit for it when they paid their bills? In other words if someone buys stamps in advance, could we have a system whereby if he has had a Â£20 bill he can pay it with Â£19 of stamps, if they were bought over a regular period? If I, as an individual, am prepared to buy a Â£1 voucher every week at a post office, could I not get some credit for paying in advance? If there were such a system, it would help a great deal to encourage more people to buy vouchers or stamps. It would also help the board by having more cash available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Doig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman not aware that, under the old system of pre-payment metersâ€”which he appears to regret had to goâ€”with all the dangers of break-in and everything else, people were equally paying in advance, as against paying a quarterly bill? There was no question of getting interest on pre-payments. People paid a higher rate because of the cost of collecting that money, as well as running the risk of the meter being robbed. Does he not appreciate that,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0233">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
for the consumer this system introduced by the SSEB is a vast improvement over the old pre-payment meter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept all the factual points made by the hon. Gentleman. I do not, however, agree with him on the wishes of the consumers. I am sure that, in his own constituency, and certainly in mine, there are hundreds of people who would infinitely prefer to have a pre-payment meter, even if it meant that they paid a little more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been approached by many constituents asking whether they can have a pre-payment meter because they cannot face up to these Â£30 and Â£40 bills, and I have written to the boards on this subject. It is true that it is not necessarily to their advantage to do it this way, but there are many people who prefer the pre-payment system. That is why I am suggesting that, if we cannot have metersâ€”because of the obvious problems of vandalism and robbery which have been mentionedâ€”we should have a system of cards by which people can make a payment and get some credit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a second and more difficult problem in my experience, and I should appreciate the Minister's figures on this. Many people these days are having their electricity cut off because of failure to pay their bills. It is alarming that, even though there are rent rebates and more welfare services than ever before, more people in Glasgow this year are being evicted for non-payment of rent. Although I do not have the figures I believe that a serious problem is arising over the payment of electricity bills. Many of these families are in receipt of supplementary benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is tragic that families who are unable to budget for their rent or for quarterly electricity bills are suddenly finding themselves in the position of owing perhaps Â£120 and can find no easy way out. The social work departments help by giving grants but, at the end of the day, there is a terrific problem of inability to budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the Minister willing to discuss with the electricity boards the possibility of the Supplementary Benefit Commission, as it does in some cases with rents, making direct payments to the boards for electricity bills? We made the mistake, in supplementary benefit cases, of removing rent rebates and giving them more cash in their hands. They did not lose any money in consequence, but this difficulty
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
is adding to the number of families who are unable to cope.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The adoption of such a system would reduce the number of families who have their power cut off and are then faced with the problem of paying for reconnection and, as some of them have to do, of paying Â£70 for their bill and then an additional Â£50â€”as a guarantee for the future. We could avoid this kind of problem if, in supplementary benefit cases, there was direct payment to the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Have the Minister and the boards any ideas on how to try to prevent the considerable increase in electricity prices which will otherwise inevitably come? Looking into the future, it seems to me that the cheapest form of power that will be available to us will be gas, because there arc good arrangements with the firms which have been prospecting for and producing gas in the North Sea to provide gas at a very low price to the British consumer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Are there any plans to convert electricity power stations to gas fuel? I know that one is under review at present, but is there any scope for expanding this idea so that we can look forward to more reasonable electricity prices in the future than will be the case if there is no such change?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My third point to the Minister, on which I hope we can hear his views, was put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, West. In Scotland we have two price areas; one for the North Board and one for the South Board. I can see that a solid, logical case could be made for every electricity power station, every gas station and every coal pit to have its price, and I see a case for saying that in the United Kingdom we should have a British price, but for the life of me I cannot see a justification for having a Scottish price for gas, two Scottish prices for electricity and variable prices for coal. We should have a United Kingdom price for all energy supplies. This matter should be investigated thoroughly, because there is a sound case for uniformity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What would this mean to the Scottish consumer? It would mean a considerable reduction in the price of gas and coal. For electricity, the latest figures show that it would mean a marginal increase for domestic users and a marginal reduction for industrial users. This system of regional pricing under which we have separate Scottish prices, is wrong and this
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0234">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
is a specific example of home rule in our own affairs not being to our advantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have an electricity supply industry: we have the grid system by which we export considerable amounts of electricity and from which we get electricity when we require it. There is a case for saying that there should be strict economic prices. It seems to me ludicrous, when we keep loss-making coal pits, which will never pay, open purely for social reasons, to provide employment, that the whole cost of so doing should be borne by Scottish coal consumers and indirectly by Scottish gas and electricity consumers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us look very carefully at United Kingdom prices for all the energy products â€”gas, coal and electricity. In the long run, this will be beneficial to our whole nation and will remove much of the confusion that has arisen over items such as night storage heating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point to the Minister is about the safeguards for consumers against increases in electricity prices. The Minister rightly said that these increases were considered by the electricity consultative councils. My experience, admittedly limited, is that the electricity consultative councils are not the ideal bodies to represent the real interests of all consumers. They are extremely useful in looking into the complaints of what one might call the articulate minority in our community, those who are already fully aware of their rights and know what to do and who can often get the electricity consultative councils to go enormous lengths to look into their problems, but for the average consumer who does not have easy access to the consultative councils, who is not very good at writing letters, who is not very good on the telephone, the councils tend to be a bit of a washout.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was ludicrous that many of these councils had their premises in the same buildings as the electricity boards. The previous Government arranged to change that, but does the Minister feel that the consultative councils provide the kind of protection for the consumer which they are designed to do and that there is no need for a change?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope the Minister appreciates that the Opposition accept that electricity prices are a serious problem and a serious burden on industry, and that we cannot wave a magic wand and resolve the difficulty. But let us at least ensure that, faced with
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
these problems, we take all possible steps to minimise the increases that will otherwise take place and, more importantly, that we make it easier for the consumer to pay the enormous bills which will inevitably follow from the high cost of fuel.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.37 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to add my congratulations to those that have been offered to the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Fairgrieve). The need for new faces in the Tory Party is not in doubt. It is rather a pity that we cannot have some new ideas to go with them. My pleasure at hearing the hon. Gentleman was somewhat reduced when I realised that there was a new tactic in the Tory Party, namely to lead from behind. We have just had the overlap down the wing, but, unfortunately for the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor) the ball was nae there, because the two two hon. Gentlemen were at different football matches. This debate was supposed to be about electricity charges, but they found that they were at the wrong football match.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart took the debate right to the political centre of the energy problem. He went right bang into the problem of the prepayment meters. That was the political content of his speech. I had hoped that we would have heard something about the electricity industry and the undoubted need for an energy policy for the whole of Scotland. Uniquely, Scotland is in a position to give a lead, not only in the United Kingdom but in Europe, on initiating an energy policy. We have our own autonomous electricity boards, the South of Scotland Electricity Board, we did have the Scottish Gas Board, and, despite the words "National Coal Board," we have our coal industry. When coal costs a bit more to produce it is Scottish coal, but when oil is found off the Scottish shores it is British oil or European oil, but never Scottish oil. We get the disadvantages, but never the advantages. I want to see an energy policy emerging in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was disappointed, too, to find that the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West did not want to go forward towards more Socialism, but more disappointing was the hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Stewart) who did not have a good
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0235">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
word to say about nationalisation. Does the hon. Gentleman imagine that the hydro-board would have been established by private enterprise, or that private enterprise would have carried all the social burdens that the hydro-board carried? Why could he not say one good word for a nationalised industry that has brought a great deal of the present prosperity, such as it is, to his part of the world, for which he should be thankful?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would have been utterly impossible for private industry to do the job that the hydro-board did. But maybe I had better award the credit to the Tories. I cannot remember the actual date when the hydro-board Bill was put through Parliament, but I believe it was before 1945.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I foresee that there will come a political situation when even hon. Gentlemen oppositeâ€”not the hon. Member for the Western Isles; I would not go so far in accusing him of anythingâ€”are quite happy about nationalisation. As my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Selby) said, so long as there seems to be a service industry, such as there is, in supporting private enterprise, they will support a nationalised industry. But when they see a nationalised industry moving into a competitive position with private enterprise, it is a matter for condemnation. As the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Fairgrieve) said, we need competition, but not the competition of the SSEB against private traders in the sale of electrical goods.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point I was trying to make is that in many instances quotations are given by, say, the electricity board, which are way out of line with another half-dozen, and sometimes much below. Presumably they are being paid for by the taxpayer. 1 still say that there is sufficient competition among the dozens of firms which are competing to sell fires and install wiring, and it is better that the nationalised corporation stays out of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure what that means. I would need to analyse it. I do know that the hon. Gentleman was crying for competition, and when he gets it he does not like it. There is another thing about competition that is not good. He talked about the competition in the Scottish League. I forget how many times in a row Celtic have won the League. All I know is that there is not a
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
great deal of competition. More important, he forgot that St. Mirren was in one of the Leagues. I do not know what competition St. Mirren give Rangers or Celtic, butâ€”</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Paisley (Mr. Robertson) should declare his interest when he refers to St. Mirren.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is hardly an interest. It is one of the punishments of political life. Occasionally one has to go and see either Motherwell or St. Mirren. But I undertake these duties happily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are some burdens which one has to undertake as well as one can. But there are burdens on Scottish industry and the Scottish community that we should not have to carry any longer. The day is past when a separate hydro-board is required. It has largely carried out its social functions in the North of Scotland, but even if there were more to be done, that is a burden that would be better spread. It does not require a separate hydro-board. We need to have one generating board for Scotland, and to look at the use of the different fuels at our disposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not happy about the Chairman of the South of Scotland Electricity Board talking about the establishment of nuclear power stations on the basis of a technology about which neither we nor anybody else is sure. The brainwashing we have had from the oil companies, to the effect that it is not possible to have fuel oil by refining North Sea oil has been disproved by two applications, unfortunately from private companies, and unfortunately not by oil companies, which are quite happy in one case to build a 20-million ton refinery, in another case, I think, a 10-million ton refinery. I am assured that what we have been told over a number of years, that there is really no fuel oil available from the North Sea, is not so; that 35 per cent. of the throughput known yesterday was the estimated figure for fuel oil through one of these refineries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Se we have another source of cheap fuel as well as the gas mentioned by the hon. Member for Cathcart. Before we go on adventuring into a nuclear programme and the establishment of nuclear parks we should investigate the possibilities of oil and gas for the Scottish energy industry.

	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
Coal, too, is of great importance. I should like to know, in the future of the Scottish coal industry, what part of the sum made available by the Government for investment in the coal industry is to come to Scotland for exploration of possible new coal seams. If there is no possibility of this, let us then make our assessment of our energy needs for the future accordingly; but do not let us pretend that there is a future for a Scottish coal industry unless some of that money is diverted to the discovery of new seams in Scotland. As well as coal for the production of energy, we badly need in Scotland coal for the production of steel. There is still some exploration work to be done in Scotland in that regard. That, however, has nothing to do with energy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want a Scottish energy board to examine the future needs of Scottish industry, the sources of fuel, and how best they can be used, and I want a plan to ensure that Scotland has the cheapest source of energy, the most efficient manner of generation, so that we can then build up a real base for a viable Scottish economy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Corrie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for coming late into the Committee; I had another meeting beforehand, and I am sorry that I did not hear my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Fairgrieve) in what clearly was a very good speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to take up one point in the Minister's remarks. He was defending the boards for not having advertised half-price electricity in Scotland. This may be so. but I well remember that, the boards were advertising a special offer of two night storage heaters for the price of one, with free fitting. So although we may not have had direct half-price electricity advertised in Scotland, we certainly were getting the carrot to put these night storage heaters in. I for one at that time took advantage of that offer to put them not only into our own house but into all the cottages on the various farms. Now these people, I fear are saying "Please take them out again because we can no longer afford to pay the bills for the electricity."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one looks at the "For Sale" columns in all the local papers at present, the articles that most people seem to want to sell are secondhand night storage heaters.
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
We have been slightly "conned" in Scotland into putting them in and using what was supposed to be cheaper electricity, even if it was not actually called half-price electricity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.49 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Lawson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to raise only two points. One is on the question of sensitivity to complaints coming from the consumer, and the other is on the efficiency or inefficiency of the industry itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am particularly concerned with the question of sensitivity because we had an attack the other day on the Floor of the House by the Leader of the Opposition, who had much to say about the fuel reorganisationâ€”so remote from the people and so impossible of control or response to effective control. One must take it that here was a contrast between the way in which a nationalised industry functions and the way in which a private industry functions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Time after time I have been approached by people in difficulty regarding electricity, either about the electricity supply being cut off or something of that sort. Time after time on their behalf, I have been in touch with the responsible people in my area. I do not say that the problem has always been answered right away, but on many occasions it has; and on all occasions, without exception, the matter has been gone into meticulously. Any hon. Member, on whichever side of the House he sits, will have similar experiences to mine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is putting forward a naive argument. What they will do for a Member of Parliament with a complaint, and what they will do for an ordinary member of the public, are two entirely different things.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lawson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I just wanted to make the contrast. Since the point was made by the Leader of the Opposition, it was really a contrast between the huge remote nationalised industries and private industry. As it happens, I have just now a particular case regarding private industry that disturbs me very much. I mention no name and use it only as an illustration.

In my constituency there are two old-age pensioners, the husband being 75 years of age, who used their life savings to go on

They had already paid the moneyâ€”more than Â£1,000. They had not received the tickets, but they had paid the money. They got back the money that they had paid, less Â£599Â·50â€” that is Â£600, less 50p. That is private enterprise.

This is a new shipping line, Chandris Shipping Line Ltd. With regard to the point which the hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Stewart) mentioned, about the response to complaints by Members of Parliament, I should tell the Committee that first, the old couple's solicitor took the matter up, and got nowhere. The matter was then brought to me. I have written and telephoned to the company. I have telephoned the chairman's home. I have sought an opportunity to speak with the chairman. I have raised the matter through the appropriate Government Department, through the consumer protection committee that we have set up, through the organisation that exists for the development of sea travel. I have been refused access to the chairman. He will not even speak to me on the telephone. He insists that the Â£599Â·50, half the life savings of this old couple, shall be retained by Chandris Shipping Line Ltd. I have put an early day motion on the Order Paper, but because of the difficulty of getting Order Papers these days, hon. Members may not have seen it. I hope to take other steps to pursue this matter. I mention this matter as an example of accessibility to a private concern by a Member of Parliament in a matter of this kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is very different from my experience with any one of the nationalised industries with which I have been concerned. It differs from what I would expect from a nationalised industry, and, indeed, from what I would have expected from any good private enterprise firm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me turn now to the second of the issues which I wish to raise. I am grateful to the South of Scotland Electricity Board for allowing me to have this excellent report, just in time for this debate. I confine myself to one aspect, the question of efficiency or competency. How do we judge it? I think most people will agree that we measure efficiency or
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
competency in terms of productivity, which is to be measured in terms of output per person employed. That is the sort of thing we seek to measure. There are many other ways, but I think nobody will challenge me if I look at it from this point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find some very interesting figures. For example, in Table 2, page 6, it is shown that in 1965 the proportion of total expenditure going in the form of salaries, wages and related costs was 16.6 per cent. In 1973â€“74, that was down to 14.8 per cent., in my calculation a fall of about 11 per cent. That is over a period of years. That is a very important figure. The proportion of the cost going in the form of manpower, or labour, has fallen quite markedly; 11 per cent. is quite a marked fall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a table on page 65 of the document which I find most revealing, and I am sure hon. Member's, in their fairness of mind, will regard it so, in terms of what has been happening with the South of Scotland Electricity Boardâ€”and this is the only one for which I have the relevant figures. In Appendix XIV there is first a table giving the total number of employees from 1965 over the years to 1974. There is, as hon. Members will see, a fall of 2,684 in the number of employees over these years, a fall of 16 per cent. This fall in the number of employees in the SSEB is accompanied by a rise in virtually every other one of the measures that we would apply. For example, in terms of fixed capital assets per employee, from 1965 to 1974, the rise was from Â£16,700 odd to just over Â£44,000 per employee, a rise of more than Â£27,000, or about 160 per cent., in that short peiod. It is very important that the employee is now carrying so much more capital than he was before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To take a related measure of efficiencyâ€”units of electricity sold per employeeâ€”in 1965 the number was 688,000 per employee; in 1974 it had gone up to 1,256,000 per employee, an increase of 568,000 units per employee, or about 85 per cent, which is not bad going over that short period.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Hydro-Board report has only just arrived, and the hon. Member might be interested to know that on page 27 there is a chart which gives a very similar picture to the one he has given in relation to the South.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0238">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
There is a picture, on this index, of a very high rate of efficiency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lawson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for the information. I do not at this stage have a Hydro Board report. I think the hon. Gentleman will agree with me that there is no more accurate means of testing efficiency in a matter which so concerns our nation, because we are always talking about our nation falling, or not measuring up in this very matter, as compared with other nations. But here, in this field, we have an excellent example of measuring up, and more than measuring up, to what, as I understand it, is happening over virtually every field of British industryâ€”I will not say private industry, but British industry as a whole. In this case the record is excellent. The final figure given here is kilowatt hours demand per employee, and that the rise is from 179 to 299, an increase of about 67 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are measures which one legitimately applies. The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Fairgrieve) will agree with me, I am sure, that these are measures</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not agree. These are internal, and not comparative figures. They may be good or bad. Until they are compared properly with those of other authorities, one cannot know.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lawson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) has given an example of the same thing applying to the hydro board. Excellent figures were given the other day in the debate on industry initiated by the Opposition. It was said that industry was doing badly in precisely this type of test. I regret this. I have talked, as others have, for many years in these terms and urged that we should do better, and here is a test which shows that the electricity industry is to be highly complimented. We could fairly say that if British industry as a whole had been doing anything like as well as the electricity industry in Scotland, let alone elsewhere, we should not have had all these problems of inflation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not often that we do this kind of thing, but we ought to compliment one of our nationalised industries on its sensitivity to complaints about difficulties for the consumer and the efficiency with
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
which it carries out the job of producing electricity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.1 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. J. Bruce Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Motherwell and Wishaw (Mr. Lawson) gave us some interesting evidence of the relative efficiency of the electricity boards. I hope that that will be sustained if we go on with the attitudes adopted by successive Governments towards the pricing of electricity. I think that the two are closely related, and I shall develop that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of sensitivity, some of us feel that the electricity boards have not always been as sensitive as one would have wished. That is over the issueâ€”I admit that it is a tricky oneâ€”raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor) of finding some manner in which customers can effectively be relieved of the burden of having to face extremely large bills at long intervals. I know that this is a problem; like most hon. Members, I have had numerous cases of constituents suddenly facing demands which they were unable to meet because the bills covered such a long period. The sort of thing about which my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart, was talking needs more careful consideration than it has been given so far by the electricity boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to concentrate on the essential issue of pricing. First, I join those who congratulated my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Fairgrieve) on his admirable opening speech, in which he effectively focused our attention on some of the major issues. It was sad that the Minister had come prepared with a totally different speech and insisted on giving it. But that was his affair, and no doubt he hopes that the fact that his speech was irrelevant to my hon. Friend's opening speech will not detract from the Press coverage which it may receive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At a time when we and all our constituents are terrified of the escalating rate of inflation, we should not underestimate the impact that increases of 26 per cent. and 29 per cent. in electricity charges will have. The fact that increases south of the border have been larger is precious little consolation to our constituents. The more this happens, the stronger is the case for some action along the lines suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0239">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
Cathcart to enable the customers of the boards to pay their bills at much shorter intervals, because the burden is increasingly becoming horrific.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, I confess that I have never believed that one alleviates the pressures of inflation by trying artificially to hold down pricesâ€”whether of foodstuffs or the products of nationalised industries â€”by subsidies from the taxpayer. I was by no means enamoured of the Statutory Corporations (Financial Provisions) Bill to which the Minister referred as providing the finance for these operations, and distance from that measure lends no enchantment. The more we try to subsidise the prices of the products of nationalised industriesâ€”or, for that matter foodstuffs, but I shall say no more about that because we are not discussing it this morning; I mention it merely because they are largely on all foursâ€”via the taxpayer, the more we diffuse resistance to the pressures of inflation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, we should recognise that in the case of the nationalised industries we are distorting the future pattern of demand. By so doing, we are likely to stimulate the need for additional capacity over and above what would be provided if we enabled the electricity boards and others to charge the prices that they would need to charge in order not merely to break even, but to make a proper return on their capital as they were required to do by the 1961 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I say to the hon. Member for Motherwell and Wishaw that there was a substantial improvement in the performance of the nationalised industries in the 1960's. I question whether we shall find that that improvement has been sustained in the 1970s. If we remove from the nationalised industries, as we have effectively done, any obligation to observe proper financial targets and financial disciplines, we shall destroy completely their improvement in performance after the imposition of financial targets at the beginning of the 1960s. The damage that is done by the attempt to stand on the symptoms of inflation in this way is both short-term and long-term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For that reason, I take no joy in the Minister's statement this morning that the expected scale of subsidisation of the electricity boards during the current year will be even greater than it was last year. I should not expect the Government to have to move one step towards proper
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
pricing for the electricity boards or any of the other nationalised industry boards, much as I should like them to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the hazards of subsidisation of prices in this way is that, once it has been embarked upon, it is very difficult to get out of it. One digs oneself into a deeper and deeper pit, and when one tries to return to reality the price increase is liable to be more than the consumer or system can be expected to stand. I believe that we should be moving as rapidly as we can back to a proper level of pricing, and I am sure that the Minister's announcement today that the scale of subsidisation this year will exceed that of last year demonstrates that, in practice, we are moving in the wrong direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I conclude, I should like to mention the relationship, of which we are all well aware, between the pricing of electricity and the cost of coal production. The Minister reminded us that two-thirds of the electricity produced in Scotland is generated by coal. To my mind, one of the consequences of massive and expanding subsidisation of electricity prices is a diminution in public resistance to what may appear to be wholly unjustifiable claims at any given time by, for instance, the National Union of Mineworkers. If the taxpayer is to be obliged to shoulder part of the cost of yet another very substantial increase in the cost of production of coal later this year, I do not think we should be surprised if Mr. McGahey and his friends feel that they have all to go for and nothing to lose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yesterday, Mr. McGahey was calling for the Â£5,000-a-year miner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have no objection to a Â£5,000-a-year miner, provided that the miners were employed in pits which made a positive contribution to the wellbeing of the industry, and I shall come to that in a moment. We must recognise that a Â£5,000-a-year miner will lead, in one form or another, to a Â£50-a-week electricity bill, either directly paid for by the customer or indirectly paid for by taxation. We should hardly be surprised, under those circumstances, that we are talking about a horrific escalation of inflation ahead of us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0240">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
I conclude with one comment on the interesting and important matter raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Cathcart when he called for the introduction of United Kingdom pricing for all energy supplies and complained that we in Scotland were expected to meet the cost of loss-making coal pits which will never pay and which are kept open for social reasons. Before long, we shall have to face this issue squarely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot see what social purpose is served by sending elderly men down into the bowels of the earth to produce coal without which, frankly, the economy and the Coal Board would be better off. I do not believe that that serves a social purpose at all. It certainly adds to the costs of electricity generation in Scotland. If we want to bring some sanity into the whole pricing system of electricity in Scotland, this is something that must be looked at most urgently.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.14 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. BruceGardyne) and I would come up with somewhat different solutions, I agree with him that there is a very real problem of possible restrictions on the investment programmes of the electricity industry. It would be tragic if in anything that we did in the next five or 10 years by skimping on investment we found that those industries were less efficient than they might otherwise be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to support my hon. Friend Member for Motherwell and Wishaw (Mr. Lawson) in what he said about our personal experience as Members of Parliament of the SSEB. As far as the Bathgate offices are concerned, like the Motherwell office, they are obliging, efficient, humane and quick. There is no reason to believe that the service is different only after MPs complain. There is widespread admiration for the speed with which they reply to any genuine complaint with which they are faced. I think we should place on record the praise that some of us would like to give the SSEB local offices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the Minister that we have to acquit the South of Scotland Board of making any claim to false pretences which have not been honoured. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
truth is that, whatever some of the English boards did, wisely or unwisely in retrospect, never at any time did the SSEB hold out the carrot of half prices. This is perhaps a credit to its foresight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I rise on one particular issue. I admit that it is entangledâ€”and must necessarily be soâ€”with the problems of electricity borrowing powers. I understand that it is not the Scottish Committee, but perhaps on consideration by the Statutory Instruments Committee there will be consideration of borrowingâ€”</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may have inadvertently misled the Committee. It is a special 	<i>ad hoc</i> Statutory Instruments Committee. This is a new procedure, and I confess that I am not absolutely familiar with it. It must have been introduced within the last year. It is an 	<i>ad hoc</i> Statutory Instrument Committee to discuss orders which, under previous arrangements, used to come before the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I am on the margin of order, I excuse myself on the grounds of being equally concise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My concern is the system which has grown upâ€”and I blame nobody for it, neither the last government nor the one before that nor ourselvesâ€”of inquiries relating to power stations. I refer particularly to the inquiry that has taken place on the Carriden site in the town hall of Boness and the inquiry that has recently taken place at Torness. I have considerable worries whether lawyers, with all the paraphernalia of evidence, are the best people to decide these highly complex and sensitive questions, especially if organisations like SSEB can hire a battery of lawyers which others, like Franks of the Eastern, cannot afford. For example, I find it incredibleâ€”and as far as this Government are concerned, it was an inherited decisionâ€”that there can be a meaningful discussion of a proposed and necessary oil-fired power station in the upper reaches of the Forth at a time when the central Government has not come to any conclusion on reactor choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I relate this to electricity charges by pointing out that the legal fees involved and the whole setting up of these inquiries are extremely expensive. I read through the evidence and, although endless details were gone into, there was no real discussion
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0241">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
of the central question, namely what would be the likely price and availability of Arab oil in the mid-1980s. We have all been told that North Sea Oil is not suitable for burning at power stations and, therefore, it has necessarily to be Arab oil. At no time during the Boness inquiry was there any serious deliberation of what the prices will be to this country of Arab oil on top of what is necessary for Killingholme, and on top of what is necessary for Littlebrook D and a number of other oil-fired power stations, including the tragic decision to go oil-fired at Boddam, rather than have a nuclear power station at Stakeness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is no good crying over proverbial spilt milk. These inquiries have taken place. I criticise nobody for the fact that they have done so. I am concerned about the future and to get some kind of assurance that reflection is going on as to the kind of decision that ought to lead to the siting of either nuclear power stations or-1 know my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley (Mr. Robertson) does not like this, but some of us doâ€”the idea of a nuclear park. Nuclear parks have their attractions. Together with the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North (Mr. Fletcher) the right hon. Member for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Jenkin) and my right hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, North-East (Mr. Palmer), I had the good fortune to go as a guest of Ontario Hydro and Quebec Hydro to see the Canadian set-up. If one goes to Bruce or Pickering, one of which is working, and working perfectly, running at a 95 per cent. efficiency rate, it seems very attractive indeed that there should be the idea of a major nuclear park in the case of Scotland in the constituency of the hon. Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Ancram).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come back to this point: for heavens sake, we really must reflect, before we become entangled in the whole paraphernalia of complex and expensive inquiries, whether this is the right way to go about it. In my opinion, that whole public inquiry at Carriden was a waste of public funds, because crucial questions of the price of oil and reactor choice went unasked.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) would like to be called at about 12.30. so I have time to call one more Member.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.22 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamish Gray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended speaking this morning but, in the true tradition of Parliament, I feel that I have been provoked into making a contribution by some of the other contributions today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I join other hon. Members in congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Fairgrieve) on his debut on the Front Bench this morning. I hope we shall hear many more contributions from him in that capacity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In opposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that he will not be in opposition for very long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that the hon. Member for Paisley (Mr. Robertson) has left, because I disagree with him most vehemently with his suggestion that there should be one board. The North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board may have its faults and limitations, but to the people living in the Highlands of Scotland it is preferable a Scottish board. I hope that the Minister will not take too seriously what his hon. Friend the Member for Paisley said in that regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor) floated the real and reasonable idea of a British price, but I do not go with him all the way, as I happen to represent a part of the country from which the greater amount of Scotland's power is derived. The Highlands of Scotland have provided power for years but, regrettably, price-wise they have not had any great compensation for the power which they have supplied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that in the highlands tremendous prosperity is near at hand. Our one problem is labour. The difficulty is to get people to come to the Highlands, despite the prosperity that is in the offing. There is, surely a stronger case than ever for a variation in the rate of electricity charges. If one wants people and particular industries to move to an area, there is no greater incentive than to offer them cheaper costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that there were negotiations over electricity prices, at the time that the smelter moved to Invergordon, between the British Aluminium Company and the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board and that a rate was agreed which at that time probably considered very competitive.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0242">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
The British Aluminium Company is the largest user of electricity in the whole of the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Boards' area, and there is a strong case for special consideration being given to the terms available in the Highland area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the social aspects of these boards, certainly those of North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board have not been fulfilled. For example, the connection charge to people building their own homes or wishing to take electricity into old houses in the Highlands is still high. I have taken up many of these cases. The board has always considered them reasonably and has always been hopeful but, unfortunately, all too frequently it has not been able to make a reduction or has been able to make only a slight one. This could be improved, as could the whole question of electricity costs, which is the subject of this debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for South Angus (Mr. Bruce-Gardyne) spoke about taxpayers subsidising the boards. I agree with him wholeheartedly on the general question of nationalisation. I do not, however, agree that the subsidy should necessarily be kept at one level. Surely it can be varied from time to time. We must accept that we cannot have our cake and eat it. Some of my hon. Friends at times forget this. 1 believe that there is a strong case for special consideration for the part of the country which 1 represent, and I hope that the Minister will consider that point along with many others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not take any more time, as I know that my hon. Friend is anxious to wind up the debate and has many points to make, but I am glad to have had this opportunity of making a brief contribution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.27 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that it will be the wish of the whole Committee that I should repeat the congratulations offered to my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Fairgrieve), who made such a splendid opening speech to the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that I cannot congratulate the Minister on the way in which he responded to my hon. Friend's speech. The hon. Gentleman gave us an interesting lecture, but it was not a contribution to this debate, because the Minister had made the
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
arrogant assumption that we were going to mount a great attack on night storage heaters. I remind him that we fought that battle last week, and won it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any event, as I indicated myself in an intervention during that debate last week, the position in Scotland is rather different. Because it is rather different, I had hoped that the right hon. Gentleman would have been able last week to give us some further information about what was to happen in Scotland, and at least I can say "Thank you" to the Minister for telling us something today, even if it is one week too late.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Minister that my hon. Friend showed in his opening speech that we were approaching today's debate in a spirit of contemplation of the future, and I thought that the Minister would welcome that. I suggest that next time, instead of jumping to premature and wrong conclusions, it might enter his head to have a word with one of us beforehand to see whether he can make a constructive contribution to the debate from the Government Front Bench.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that the Minister chose to ignore one of the central points made by my hon. Friend, namely the impact of the next coalminers' wage demand on electricity prices in Scotland. That is a very important point, to which I will return.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is good to see that so many hon. Members were able to take part in the debate. They all had something useful and interesting to say, not least the hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Stewart), who, after his pleasant metaphor about the boxing ring, proceeded to fall flat on his face in the middle of it, by appearing to argue that authority should be moved outside Scotland to England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then we had the interesting, if slightly bizarre contribution from the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Selby), who has a splendidly simple solution to the problem of electricity prices. His solution is to abolish charges entirely. It is an ingenious way out of a difficult position. I ask the hon. Gentleman how, if we abolished charges for electricity and all the other things that he wants to make free, one would pay for them. He has a blindingly, stunningly simple answerâ€”one does not pay for them,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0243">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
because one abolishes money also. I do not know to which party the hon. Gentleman belongs, but I am about to join him, because his solution appeals to me enormously. It is a neat solution to my perpetual problem of trying to make ends meet. When everything costs nothing, it is easier to balance the books, particularly when money is abolished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor) had some pointed things to say about the future, and I shall comment on them in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree entirely with my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Ross and Cromarty (Mr. Gray). How nice it is to be able to hear his voice again after the enforced silence of being a Government Whip. It is good to hear him standing up for the separate identity of the North of Scotland Hydro-Electricity Board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many different sincere views held about the board. I know the board's area, and it has done remarkably well in living up to its statutory obligations in trying to improve the life of the Highlands. I am sure that it is fitting, if not strictly in order, in passing to pay a small tribute to the men in the board's area who turn out in all sorts of weather and work very hard in the dark in a gale to keep the electricity supply going.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Motherwell and Wishaw (Mr. Lawson) called attention to another agreeable feature of the two Scottish boards, namely the courtesy which they always show to Members of Parliament and the way in which they always deal with our complaints. I agree with the hon. Gentleman, and I should like to thank both the chairman and their staff for the way they have helped me as a private Member with problems which are put to me from time to time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures produced by the hon. Gentleman were convincing evidence of efficiency. I do not want to make any reflections on the boards, but merely to state a fact. Some people would apply another measure of efficiency, namely, the level of price per unit charged by the boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Looking ahead to the future, one becomes worried about the prospects. In the running of a business, some problems which face other industries are lessened or removed by the holding of a monopoly over the distribution and sale of an essential commodity to a captive market. It changes the situation in some
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
way. But I do not want to make any reflections on the boards because, by and large, they run extremely well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We selected electricity prices for our debate this morning, the first of the estimates debates, because they have an instant and real impact on the cost of living. I shall show in a moment that their impact on people in Scotland is considerably greater than on people living elsewhere in the United Kingdom. I think that quite often the difference is not recognised. A rise in electricity prices hits harder in Scotland than in the United Kingdom generally, and in a moment I shall explain why.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite the impact on Scotland, and just as electricity prices are about to rise again steeply, the Government appear to have no policy at all on the pay and prices front. Perhaps I should say that they have no effective policy, because they have a policy of sorts. It is the policy of surrender. The much vaunted social contract is not worth the paper it is not even written on. Already we see how surrender one day leads inevitably to a new demand the next.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend referred to the new demands by the National Union of Mineworkers, and today's papers are full of it. One of last evening's paper had the headline,
	<br><blockquote><p>"Charter for the Â£100-a-week miner".</p></blockquote>
Presumably that is a new charter which will be presented to the union's annual conference next week. The demand is not only for Â£100 a week, but for Â£100 for a four-day week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Gourlay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is jumping the gun. This is only a suggestion from one section of the National Union of Mineworkers. Why does he not wait until next week, when the decision will be made? He will then see that there is a certain sense of responsibility amongst the miners.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us see what happens. I am merely making the point that a surrender one day leads to new demands the next. That is precisely what has happened, and is happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, the price of coal will continue to rise under pressure of this sort, and that will inevitably force up electricity prices yet again. It is no wonder that there is considerable anxiety among electricity users in Scotland about the future,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0244">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
and particularly among the old and the low-paid who suffer most when electricity prices go up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is to be the next stage in the fight against inflation? Or have the Government gone into a state of total retreat? How will the Government handle the next large demand from the miners? That has a direct and important bearing on our debate, and I hope that the Minister will make some attempt to answer that question. There is complete uncertainty about the way in which the Government intend to handle this enormous wage demand, even if it is modified as the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy (Mr. Gourlay) indicates. There was evidence last week of the muddle which the Government made on the question of off-peak prices in the south. They showed total insensitivity towards electricity users and acted only when confronted by a determined Opposition and the near-certainty of yet another humiliating defeat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had the benefit this morning as the hon. Member for Motherwell and Wishaw (Mr. Lawson) reminded us, of the Report of the South of Scotland Electricity Board, and a few minutes ago we saw the Report of the North of Scotland board. Before I turn to thatâ€”and I am not sure whether I shall have time to go into detailâ€”I call the attention of the Committee to some other figures which I have drawn from the latest issue of the Scottish Abstract of Statistics and Social Trends. They relate to the year 1972, but I am sure that the Minister will agree that there is no reason to suppose that the pattern has changed since then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures show the extent to which electricity prices bear on living costs in Scotland. In Scotland, household expenditure on fuel, light and power is higher than in the United Kingdom generally. In Scottish homes, more money is spent on fuel, light and power than in homes in the United Kingdom generally. That cost is a higher proportion of total spending than in the United Kingdom generally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The pattern becomes even clearer in a table which identifies spending on electricity. The average Scottish home spends one-quarter more on electricity then the average home in the United Kingdom. For every Â£4 spent on electricity in the United Kingdom as a whole Â£5 is spent on electricity in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
Furtherâ€”and I want to emphasise thisâ€”the proportion of income spent on fuel, light and power increases sharply in those homes which have the smallest incomes. The well-to-do, with a weekly income of Â£60, spend 4 per cent. on fuel, light and power. The household with an income of Â£30â€”Â£40 spends 6 per cent., but the pensioner living alone spends 14 per cent. the pensioner living alone spends 14 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to my central point. The electricity industry in Scotland depends heavily on coal, and the Minister emphasised this again this morning. The South of Scotland board uses two-thirds of the entire Scottish outputâ€”80 per cent. of its plant uses coal. That must surely be a pattern of over dependence, and the board's development plan will provide greater flexibility. Four of its new plants will be nuclear stations, and the fifth will be oil or gas-fired.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Paisley (Mr. Robertson) said that there must be further and careful study of the future needs of the industry and future sources of supply, and I agree with him. I think that study is probably a continuing process, but I make two points in that connection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Firstâ€”and the Minister will correct me if I am wrongâ€”I understand that about 20 per cent. of capacity in England and Wales can be fired by coal or by oil. They are interchangeableâ€”relatively simple I understand. Is that so? What similar alternative provision is planned in Scotland? When we consider the steep price rise in oil and coal and the great difficulties which industry in Scotland, particularly in the south, had during the industrial dispute in the coal mines, one realises that the opportunity to switch from one form of firing to another was severely restricted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If hon. Members look at page 2 of the SSEB report, they will see what seems to me to be a very disturbing comment:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Efforts were made by the Board during the year to obtain supplies of the gas associated with the oil to be brought ashore from the Forties Field. Provisional agreement was reached with British Petroleum to buy all the gas available but this agreement was nullified by the British Gas Corporation who, under existing legislation, have the first refusal of all such supplies. Negotiations were opened with the B.G.C. but these were unproductive. The Board had planned to convert Kincardine Power Station to dual coal/gas firing and had applied in August, 1973, to the Secretary of State for Scotland for the necessary approval, which was contingent on gas supplies being made available."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0245">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
The Gas Corporation said "No," and BP has understandably, I suppose, exercised its right to withdraw from the provisional agreement. I hope that the Minister will make some comment on that because, it seems to me to be an important matter which could have a real effect on some of the factors which affect the prices of electricity in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that the cost of electricity over the years is likely to increaseâ€”that must be accepted. The impact on the price of electricity of increases in the price of coal will be very considerable indeed. I referred a moment ago to the overdependence of the SSEB on coal firing. Some people think that the North of Scotland is somehow insulated from this process because in that area there is no coal-fired supply, but the North of Scotland board imports electricity in large quantities from the south, and so the effect of higher coal prices is felt in the north.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the point of being able to switch from coal fired to oil fired generating stations if we cannot prevent the miners from stopping the oil-fired generators and stations from working? Is he aware that his Government did absolutely nothing about it the last time this happened?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman consults the industry in the light of its experience over the last months, he will find, as I did, that the industry would welcome a larger range of choice than it has at present. This would be one way of providing it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that every reasonable person accepts that miners must be well paid, but at what point does escalation stop? Do we give enough thought to the other side of the wages equation? If our society decides that demands such as that made by Mr. McGahey arc to be accepted, then the people in our society â€”and that includes the miners themselves â€”must recognise that the consequences must be accepted also, and these consequences among others are a massive rise in the price of electricity. In this field particularly, one man's pay rise is the pensioner's nightmare, the terrible problem of getting an ever-increasing bill for electricity, and electricity is essential to the life, indeed to the survival, of many old people in Scotland who have no alternative fuel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
This raises great problems for all Governments. To what extent should the supply of electricity be subsidised by the general taxpayer? My hon. Friend the Member for South Angus (Mr. BruceGardyne) drew our attention this morning to the economic consequences of subsidy. I have no doubt that the Conservative Government were absolutely right to reduce or defer some previously proposed increases, because of the effect which these would have had on prices at a time of pay and price restraint. That is why I welcome the Statutory Corporations (Financial Provisions) Act which has been referred to, and the South Board's report shows how helpful that Act has been to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has told us that the rate of subsidy is likely to increase this year, or I took him to say that. What will happen in the future, following these massive new demands which will confront us before long? The Government now are apparently devoid of any policy on that front whatsoever. Are the Government going to let things rip this autumn on the pay front? Will the Secretary of State for Scotland, if he has a responsibility in this matter, simply go on mouthing the words "social compact, social compact" as he sinks into the sea of rising inflation? He is less ready to do his sums than I would wish, and I hope that the Minister will help me to get some answers from the Secretary of State. I am still waiting for him to tell me what effect the increases in the Budget will have on the cost of living of the ordinary family in Scotland. I now ask him to tell us what will happen to prices in Scotland, and particularly to electricity prices, if the Government continue their course of surrender and abandon the principle of pay restraint.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally I should like to commentâ€”and I do not expect a detailed reply to this today from the Ministerâ€”on the very interesting speech made by my hon. Friend the Member for Cathcart to which I have already referred. If we accept the inevitability of increases in electricity prices, we must also accept the inevitability of changing public attitudes to electricity itself and to the way in which it is used, and show at the same time a greater awareness and concern for the social problem which will confront many people in Scotland as electricity bills rise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0246">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
My hon. Friend regretted the phasing out of the pre-payment meter and I agree with him. I disagree with the hon. Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Doig). There is some advantage for many people in adopting a policy of pay-as-you-burn, as at least they know where they are from day to day. The alternative, of course, is the stamp scheme, which is quite widely used, I understand. But I wonder whether the boards call sufficient attention to the existence of this facility. Would it not be sensible and simple to send a note about the availability of this system with the next quarter's electricity bill, to try to attract more people to that method of easing the burden of electricity payments?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What about attitudes themselves? What more help can we give to make the use of electricity in the home more efficient and more economical? This is a matter very much for people in the housebuilding business, for local authorities and indeed for the Government also. Do we make enough use of time switches and devices such as thermostatic controls in houses being build today? Above all, do we spend enough time thinking about the economic advantages of double glazing and of insulation of all kinds? Ts there not perhaps a case for looking again at home improvement grantsâ€”I put this simply as a questionâ€”to see whether we could produce greater economy and help people more by extending the scope of these grants to include insulation methods of this kind?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I promised to stop at this point, but I must say that it is depressing me, at this time of deep economic depression, to witness the constant irrelevance of the Government's policies. Inflation is running away at an unprecedented rate; yet the only policy one can discern is the drawing up of a list of industries to be nationalised. If only they would concentrate on at least one part of the problem, the impact of electricity prices on everyday life. The question we must now ask the Government is: what now lies ahead? What new burdens are in store for Scotland? What action, if any, will the Government take in the face of new demands by Mr. McGahey which, if conceded, would drive electricity prices to unimagined heights?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
	<p>12.50 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the leave of the Committee, perhaps I may reply to the debate. I noticed the same apparent lack of interest in discussing the recent price increases and particularly the impact of off-peak consumers continued throughout this morning's debate. I have little to say in addition to what I have already said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Fairgrieve) was extremely careful not to say whether he thought that price increases we have just had in Scotland were too high, too low or about right. If we are to have a sensible debate we must have some indication from the Opposition of what their view and judgment is on this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If they say the price increases are too high, they are asking for an additional burden on taxation. If they say that they are too low, they are asking for an additional burden to be placed on the consumer. There is no escape from the dilemma. I do not for one moment pretend that in any particular circumstance one gets the equation exactly right. It is bound to be a compromise, a balance between the need, on the one hand, in terms of counter-inflation, to keep price increases down and, on the other, to maintain as far as possible the principle upon which the nationalised industries have been run so far, that they are expected to balance their books taking one year with another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is undesirable in principle, in normal circumstancesâ€”certainly it is true as far as electricity is concernedâ€”that there should be large subventions from the taxpayer. It does not make a great deal of sense in normal circumstances that that should be so. We are not living in normal times, so far as inflation is concerned. I do not want to go into the matter in any considerable detail, but the kind of inflationary pattern that we have at the moment is extremely serious. This did not start only three months ago. It is a situation which was inherited by this Government and is extremely serious. It is important that we should have a pay and prices policy which meets the demands of the present situation. We have already taken action in terms of food price restraints and food subsidies to lessen the impact of inflation on ordinary people. It is not trueâ€”as will become
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0247">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>49</span>
clear when my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Employment announces the policy on pay which is to replace the present statutory policyâ€”that we have simply surrendered and suggest that wage demands, however extravagant, do not matter in the management of the economy. Obviously they do. It is in everyone's interests that we should have a degree of restraint which manages to keep down the impact of inflation on ordinary people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far as electricity prices are concerned, I will take up one or two points of detail about difficulties in paying bills and so on. Some of these matters are already taken care of by the boards when they have arrangements for paying bills on a monthly basis or by selling stamps. I shall certainly see that various suggestions made by hon. Members this morning are passed on to them and, no doubt, the boards will consider them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was glad to know from hon. Members on both sides of the Committee that the boards are sensitive to complaints put to them by hon. Members and by other people; similarly, I agree that they are sensitive to suggestions about lessening the impact of large bills on consumers. No doubt, therefore, they will listen to the suggestions that have been made this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now I shall deal with the rate of increase in the Hydro-Board and why it should be so high, as the hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Stewart) indicated, when some of the power in the northern area is supplied by hydro-electricity. That is true, but the propotion supplied by hydro-power in the North is only 40 per cent. now. The bulk of the rest of it, incidentally, comes from oil-generated electricity, which has borne a disproportionately large increase compared with coal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I make a general point here that, although hon. Gentlemen have complained that we are too dependent on coal, whatever the legitimacy of that complaint, if the position had been reversed and we had been similarly dependent on oil, the price increases would have had to be even higher from an economic point of view; but in the case of the North Board's area only a part of the generation comes from hydro-power, and the overall increases in the North area are lower than they are in the South of Scotland, which reflects the different situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
If we wanted to allocate a different generation cost to different parts of the. North Board area, for example, the constitutency that would come off worst is that of the hon. Member for the Western Isles. He does not have hydro power, except to a minimal extent, in his constituency; he depends on diesel generation, and it is there that the prices have gone higher than ever. His constituents, as the North of Scotland Board's accounts make clear, are being subsidised by the hydro-board's consumers on the mainland. I think that is a sensible way of proceeding, but if one wants to adhere to strict rules of economics the hon. Gentleman's constituency will suffer greater increases than anybody else's, and I hope he is not recommending that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. D. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised that the Minister should pick out one constituency as against another. It is true that the bulk of the electricity in my constituency is produced from oil-fired stations. On the other hand, we pay television licence fees for one service, so if we are saving on one service we are subsidising another.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mt. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I notice that the more I talk about electricity prices the more everybody wants to talk about something else, in this case television licences. Hon. Gentlemen were saying that consumers in the North of Scotland should be favourably treated on an economic basis compared with consumers in the South. I am simply saying that if one adopts that principle and extends it a bit further, there seems to be no reason why consumers on the mainland, say from Ross and Cromarty in the North, should subsidise the consumers in the hon. Gentleman's constituency. I do not accept the argument, but it was not one that I put; it was put by the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the future of electricity generation in Scotland, the South of Scotland Board has a number of applications for power stations put forward at present. Two of these are nuclear and one, to which my hon. Friend the Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) specifically referred, is oil fired. I should explain that the first inquiry is basically a planning inquiry. The actual permission to build the station comes at a later stage, and it is at that point that the question of energy policy is most relevant. I rather agree with
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0248">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>51</span>
himâ€”although I must not comment one way or the other on that inquiryâ€”that a planning inquiry is perhaps not always a suitable forum for the discussion of these wider issues, although that tends to happen at these inquiries. But I am not sure if the Secretary of State can do antyhing about that, given the existing statute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In answer to my hon. Friend and to a number of points that were made, may I say that we are very conscious of the need in Scotland, first, for an overall energy policy and, secondly, to achieve the right kind of mix between coal, nuclear-and oil-fired generation, taking Scotland as
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
a whole. Those are difficult and sensitive issues. Some of them will be subjects for debate, if hon. Members wish, in next Wednesday's Statutory Instruments Committee on the borrowing Order. I am sorry that I have not been able to cover these difficult matters this morning in this inevitably restricted debate, but I hope that I have at least set the record straight so far as prices are concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
