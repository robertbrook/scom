The Scottish Constitutional Convention</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the Secretary of State to speak, I wish to make it known to the Committee that more than the usual number of hon. Members have applied to speak in the debate. Given the time that the Front-Bench spokesmen will take to make their contributions, it would be better if speeches were curtailed to less than 10 minutes, so that hon. Members will not be disappointed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Norman A. Godman <span class='memberconstituency'>(Greenock and Port Glasgow)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. As you know, Mr. Speaker Weatherill has authority under Standing Order No. 45A to limit the length of speeches to 10 minutes. I wonder whether you can call on that Standing Order to issue a similar edict. I ask that because I have a vested interest.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not have those powers. I am in the hands of the Committee.</span></p>
<p>10.31 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Ian Lang)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do report to the House that the Committee has considered the matter of the proposals of the Scottish Constitutional Convention.</p></blockquote>
I am glad that the Opposition accepted my invitation to devote all four matter days in the Scottish Grand Committee to debating the most fundamental issue affecting Scotland's future, namely, its place within the constitution of the United Kingdom. I am glad, too, that we are beginning the debates with a double day here in Edinburgh, and I hope that the Opposition will take the opportunity that that affords to seek to prove their case.<br><br>
The onus of proof is on the proponents of change. They want to set aside 300 years of successful partnership and evolutionary constitutional change in which Scotland's constitutional circumstances have been fully recognised. Indeed, the fact that we can debate the issue in Edinburgh is evidence of that evolutionary change under the hands of this Government. The responsibility for proving their case lies with Opposition Members.<br><br>
The proponents of devolution must specify the full financial, social and political costs of such a change. As the Leader of the Opposition said in an article in <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> in January 1976, the Opposition must prove the need for accepting those costs. The Opposition have so far failed dismally to do that.<br><br>
Events have now moved on with the travelling roadshow appearing in the Usher hall and the Assembly rooms. During those debates it became clear that the Labour party's flagship policy—HMS Devolution—is holed below the water line, before it has even left the harbour.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
I shall focus today mainly on the economic and tax-raising powers proposed in Labour's constitutional convention. I hope that we shall discuss in later debates constitutional aspects and the European dimension. I welcome in particular to the Committee the hon. Members for Livingston (Mr. Cook) and for Dunfermline, East (Mr. Brown), and the right hon. and learned Member for Monklands, East (Mr. Smith). I hope that they will participate in our debate, make their positions clear and, possibly, say whether they consider it more appropriate that they should be members of a Scottish Parliament or a Westminster Parliament.<br><br>
After all, it was the hon. Member for Livingston who said:
<br><blockquote><p>"After devolution, the position of Scottish hon. Members will be untenable."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 14 November 1977; Vol. 939, c. 157.]</p></blockquote>
He said that in 1977 but, in fairness to him, his view has not waivered. He has further refined it by saying that, once a Scottish Parliament is set up with powers over health issues in Scotland, he cannot remain as a Minister for Health in England. Perhaps that is the Livingston answer to the west Lothian question, but I think that it is a blinding glimpse of the truth. How can a Scottish Member of a Westminster Parliament protect the health interests of his constituents when health matters are controlled by a separate Parliament? How can a Scottish Member, as a Government Minister, credibly control health matters for England and Wales while his constituents live in a separate jurisdiction? Those questions must be answered if the scheme proposed by the constitutional convention is to have credibility or stability. By the same principle, the issue of voting rights must be considered.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Hughes <span class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has the Secretary of State read that one of his ministerial colleagues has conceded that the Tories in Scotland will be wiped out, and that it would be necessary and tenable for a Member of Parliament from England to serve as Secretary of State for Scotland? Does not that go against the right hon. Gentleman's argument?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lang</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, it does not. The point suggested by the hon. Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Hughes) was not conceded by one of us. In a unitary Parliament, there is no problem with hon. Members who represent a certain part of the country serving in Departments which are responsible for other areas. For example my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind) is Secretary of State for Transport and the hon. Member for Clackmannan (Mr. O'Neill) is shadow Secretary of State for Defence. Problems would arise only when there were separate entrenched powers in separate rival Parliaments with separate jurisdictions. The issue is not a storm in a teacup, as the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) has suggested.<br><br>
Under such a proposal, we would have two-tier Ministers, two-tier Members of Parliament and a two-tier Cabinet. We Scots would become second-class citizens at the very heart of our democracy. That would create a deep fissure, which would strike at the core of our constitutional roots.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson <span class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: We already have two-tier Members of Parliament. The majority of hon. Members who represent Scotland are Opposition Members and we have been prevented from taking part in the legislative process in Committee on issues such as the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0032">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
poll tax, whereas English Members of Parliament have been drafted in repeatedly by the right hon. Gentleman's colleagues to pack Committees that deal exclusively with Scottish legislation, thereby inflicting unwanted legislation on Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lang</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman does not understand the fundamental principles of a unitary Parliament in a unitary state. It is interesting that he has already made his choice. In fairness to him, unlike some of his hon. Friends, he has opted for the second division of the Scottish Parliament to sit in rivalry to his hon. Friends in the Westminster Parliament.<br><br>
I am especially glad that the right hon. and learned Member for Monklands, East is in Committee today. I wrote to him last week and asked him to be here—<i>[Laughter.]</i> Opposition Members may find that funny, but he has never before attended these sittings. If I am wrong about that, I shall withdraw that statement. The right hon. and learned Gentleman has rarely been here on previous occasions. He has never spoken in our deliberations. I urge him to speak today and to make his position clear on the Cook doctrine. Is the Livingston dilemma the answer to the west Lothian question?<br><br>
I hope that the right hon. and learned Gentleman will take the opportunity to clarify the overall effect of his United Kingdom tax proposals. Will he explain the eight new tax pledges that will add new tax burdens on the whole of the United Kingdom for the purpose of going some way to fund the £35 billion and more of increased spending that his hon. and right hon. Friends have promised? Will he make it clear how much freedom he, as Chancellor of the Exchequer, would grant to a Scottish Parliament or how much he would feel constrained by the separate entrenched powers that Opposition Members wish to set up?<br><br>
We know answers to some of the questions. We know that the Opposition might allow tax to rise by as much as 3p in the pound. That would create a new position because, alone in the United Kingdom, Scots who pay income tax would pay more tax than their counterparts elsewhere in the United Kingdom. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Opposition Members seem to find that amusing, too. That policy would mean an extra £7 a week for a single man on average earnings which would be a separate burden that was not shared by others. Such a policy would raise only about £430 million, which is a fraction of the present Scottish Office budget.<br><br>
I wonder whether the right hon. and learned Gentleman can guarantee that, given that position, those resources would be additional to the existing advantage that Scotland derives from the United Kingdom, whereby the United Kingdom Treasury continues to spend, for every £4 per head that it spends in England, £5 per head in Scotland. The benefit on identifiable public expenditure is £600 higher in Scotland than it is in England, 24 per cent. higher and £500 higher than the average in the United Kingdom.<br><br>
As the <i>Daily Record</i> said, we in Scotland, do not do too badly out of the United Kingdom Exchequer. <i>The Scotsman</i> said that there would need to be an adjustment in spending, and there is no dispute about that. The right hon. and learned Gentleman may think that there is, so perhaps he will intervene in the debate and clarify the position. If he cannot give that extra guarantee to which I
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
referred, presumably extra Scottish tax would be needed just to stand still and make good the erosion of the resources coming from the Westminster Parliament. At present, the extra benefits that we derive are based on need and are related to population, but that is a vulnerable calculation. It is not enshrined in law; it is open to negotiation and renegotiation. Such a process must be defended.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Garscadden)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Secretary of State saying that, when the Scots express a clear wish for a greater say over their own affairs, within the framework of the United Kingdom, and when that is agreed by Westminster, that justifies a punitive raid on Scotland's public finances and a departure from the principle that resources are allocated on the basis of need?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lang</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No one is talking about a punitive raid. We are talking about the vulnerability of Scotland's position—we would no longer be able to defend or justify, morally or practically, the awarding of the existing substantial additional benefit to Scotland by the United Kingdom Parliament, once there was a separate tax jurisdiction in Scotland. If the resources raised in Scotland were entirely additional to resources from England, how would the shadow Chancellor, if he became Chancellor, maintain control on public expenditure? Would he make offsetting cuts in public expenditure in England, thereby making the English-Scottish ratio even higher? What borrowing powers would he give to a Scottish Parliament? The last Labour Government left debts of £24 billion, which were a massive burden on the people of the United Kingdom. In today's prices, that would be over £50 billion. How would their planned borrowing powers enable a Labour Chancellor to maintain control over macro-economic policy?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Smith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Monklands, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I object to the condescending way in which the Secretary of State invited people to come to Committees on which they have a place as of right. That condescension is in no way justified by the support that his depleted band will win from the people of Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Allan Stewart)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Get on with it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall ignore the hon. Gentleman's rude interruptions and deal with the Secretary of State's foolish points. First, if a Scottish Assembly decided to raise a certain amount of money in extra taxation, that money would be genuinely additional. Secondly, any borrowing would be agreed with the British Treasury. We have made that clear from the beginning. I do not know why the right hon. Gentleman wants to pursue an argument based on fantasy, not fact.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lang</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In other words, there would be higher taxes, which the right hon. Gentleman would not be able to control, in Scotland. How would he be able to control his macro-economic policy when, as he accepts, part of the United Kingdom's tax-raising powers would be outwith his jurisdiction?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lang</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. and learned Gentleman is entitled to speak in this debate. I challenged him to do so last week and I look forward to hearing from him. As

Chancellor of the Exchequer, he would be compromised, inhibited and constantly looking over his shoulder. Under a Labour Government, public expenditure in Scotland would be totally out of control. In the rest of the United Kingdom, it would be largely out of control—the usual situation of Labour Governments. Things would be allowed to slide. There would be higher taxation and higher spending. It would be business as usual under Labour.<br><br>
I shall deal with the powers of the Scottish Parliament. A cursory glance at the Scottish Constitutional Convention's document makes it clear that, far from devolving power, the proposals would involve the most substantial translation of power to the centre of Government since Labour's disastrous policies of the 1960s. At a time when eastern European countries are abandoning socialism and embracing capitalism, the Labour party proposes to take Scotland back to a dark age of control that would suffocate enterprise and stamp out growth and prosperity. The document's language is hair-raising. It talks about "strategic economic planning powers"; about
<br><blockquote><p>"powers to co-ordinate the planning of the Scottish components of UK industries";</p></blockquote>
about
<br><blockquote><p>"power to initiate some form of public ownership or control";</p></blockquote>
and about responsibility for the protection of Scottish industry. In other words, Labour would build a smothering cocoon around Scottish industry. It would be interventionism and protectionism from the real world. Scotland would be turned into an industrial museum. It would stagnate and decline.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gordon)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Secretary of State is aware that the Parliament will be democratically elected by a reformed electoral system? Would not the Conservative party put up candidates for that election? If the people of Scotland did not like those proposals, might not they vote for the Conservatives—or have the Conservatives written off Scotland altogether?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lang</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman thinks that he will get the reformed electoral system that he wants—proportional representation, which Lloyd George described as a device for defeating democracy—he has another think coming. The Labour party will never introduce proportional representation—the hon. Gentleman and his party are being taken for a ride.<br><br>
The proposed powers—which the document states is not an exhaustive list—would damage the strength and depth of Scottish industry. The Scottish Trades Union Congress wants to nationalise gas, electricity, telecommunications, steel and coal. Perhaps the hon. Member for Garscadden will tell us whether he agrees with that policy or whether he thinks, as he said the other day, that nationalisation is no more than a slogan, available only to a party that has no expectation of gaining power. I think we should be told.<br><br>
It is no wonder that the business community in Scotland consistently gives the thumbs down to those proposals. The document lists 30 areas ranging from coastal erosion to inland waterways, in which a Scottish Parliament would exercise powers. Many of those powers duplicate or triplicate existing arrangements. They complicate the key issue that the convention has not even begun to address—the relationship between a Scottish Parliament and the Westminster Parliament.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
Let us examine regional aid as an example. The document is worded in the flimsiest and vaguest of language. There is almost no reference to regional aid, other than an oblique comment about powers
<br><blockquote><p>"to negotiate with multi-nationals … within the context of UK regional policy."</p></blockquote>
Later, in apparent contradiction to that, the document talks of
<br><blockquote><p>"powers to establish Scotland as a competitive and attractive location for companies to establish and to encourage competitive advantage for Scottish-based business".</p></blockquote>
I shall leave aside the grammatical uncertainty of that sentence. Powers to make Scotland an attractive location for inward investment already exist. Who is it proposed that Scotland should be competitive with? With other European countries, as at the moment, or with England? Regional aid is not a Scottish bloc issue. It is funded by the United Kingdom Treasury, its resources are separately negotiated each year and the United Kingdom Parliament draws up the regional aid map. As the document says, the proposals of the Parliament would retain it within the context of United Kingdom regional policy.<br><br>
At present, two thirds of the population of Scotland are within the regional assistance map. That is far higher than the proportion of the United Kingdom population as a whole, as dominated by the regulations of the European Commission. The figure for England is around 20 per cent. In the last five years, over £400 million of regional aid has helped create or protect 70,000 jobs and attract £3·5 billion of investment to Scotland. That map and those funds would be jeopardised if the policy were divided between a Scottish Parliament and a United Kingdom Parliament. They would become non-existent if Scotland tried to compete with the rest of the United Kingdom and to pursue a separate policy.<br><br>
A similar confusion would exist over Europe. At the moment, regional and state aids, and all regulations on regional policy, are negotiated between the United Kingdom Government and the European Community. I do not think anyone is saying—perhaps the hon. Member for Garscadden will make that clear—that a Scottish Parliament would be able to circumvent the treaty of Paris and that a Labour Government would be able to pour help into the steel industry. I have not heard such an idea from the Labour Benches. The Scottish National party claims that it could do that—and it is for that party to defend that. The European regional development fund has directed resources of £1·4 billion into Scotland over the past 12 years. The importance of that cannot be overrated. However, the convention's proposal to establish an office in Brussels to—as the document puts it—"facilitate relations" with Europe and to establish a statutory entitlement to accompany United Kingdom delegations to the European Community would add nothing to the existing powers, but would considerably diminish them and the benefit that Scotland derives from Europe. I already have the power to attend Councils and to speak at them. I have done so. As a Member of the United Kingdom Parliament, I already have the power to influence the vote in the European Community. I have already "facilitated relations", with President Delors, with Commissioner Brittan, with Commissioner Andriessen and with Commissioner MacSharry—I have had meetings with all of them. The European Commission negotiates with the United Kingdom Parliament over enterprise zones, state aid, RECHAR, RESIDER, LEADER,

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
objective 5B schemes and so on. The United Kingdom is the signatory of the treaties and would continue to be: a Scottish Parliament would have no status in those negotiations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jim Sillars <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Govan)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Secretary of State tell us how many times he has headed the United Kingdom delegation to the Council of Ministers? What happens when the Scottish Office Agriculture and Fisheries Department disagrees with the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food south of the border? How are such disagreements resolved? Does Scottish opinion go with the United Kingdom's 10 votes, or is it extinguished?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lang</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman misunderstands the point about disagreements. The United Kingdom speaks with one voice in the Councils of Europe because its policies are agreed, with a full input from Wales, Northern Ireland, Scotland and England, before going to a Council of Ministers. However, the hon. Gentleman is absolutely right to fix on that point of disagreement, because if the Scottish Parliament delegate to a Council of Ministers disagreed with the United Kingdom delegate, he would have absolutely no power to change the decision; it would be a decision of the United Kingdom, not of the Scottish Parliament. I hope that the hon. Member for Garscadden can make it clear how, in those circumstances, the powers of a Scottish Parliament could enhance Scotland's place in Europe. The same is true over fishing. Scotland has half the United Kingdom total catch, yet we would disqualify ourselves from full rights as part of a United Kingdom Council of Ministers. If a Scottish Parliament breached the Commission's treaty—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Robertson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hamilton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: If it is so detrimental to Scotland's interests to have a separate Scottish voice in those delegations, how has the Federal Republic of Germany managed to do so well over the years by having exactly that relationship—the German states having their own officers in Brussels and a special status within the Federal Republic's delegation? They seem to have done it effectively and efficiently. Why can that not apply in the United Kingdom?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lang</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is arguing that we should have a federal system in the United Kingdom. The Federal Republic of Germany is just that—it is a federation. The Länder do not have the powers that the Scottish National party suggests that a Scottish Parliament should have. They do not have the right to vote in the Council of Ministers. A separate Scottish Parliament would have a similar lack of power. If a Scottish Parliament breached an EC treaty, the United Kingdom Government would be held responsible. How would the United Kingdom enforce its authority over a Scottish Parliament with entrenched powers? Commissioner Bruce Millan has given us some idea of what might happen, but we should be told. I hope that we shall be told today.<br><br>
The biggest of all the unanswered questions is: who would pay? Who would pick up the bill for that patchwork of added burdens and muddled thinking?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke <span class='memberconstituency'>(Monklands, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Secretary of State give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lang</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not at this moment.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
There is no doubt that it would cost extra money. The Labour party has ambitious and costly plans for an unsuspecting Scotland. The hon. Member for Livingston again helps with his clear, honest view that:
<br><blockquote><p>"We have to be honest about this. The Assembly will inevitably expand public expenditure. There can be no doubt about that."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 14 November 1977; Vol. 939, c. 159.]</p></blockquote>
He is right. A Scottish Parliament itself would cost the people of Scotland over £1 million a week to run, before it started doing anything. That is why, alone among the countries of the United Kingdom, Scotland has not had a promise from the Labour party that its income tax would not go up. If a Scottish Parliament comes into being, income tax will go up. The only question will be by how much.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State spoke of unanswered questions. Will he answer this question? If the Scottish Parliament would be such a disadvantage to Scotland, why did Lord Home of the Hirsel intervene in the 1979 referendum, promising an Assembly with even greater powers? Why has that never been delivered?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lang</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Like many people before and since, Lord Home has continued the search for a solution. Like many before and since, Lord Home recognised the great difficulties, which the Opposition do not recognise and will not address. They have not found a way of funding the programmes that they want a Scottish Parliament to set up. The convention document states that the revenue from Scottish income tax and Scottish VAT should be assigned to a Scottish Parliament. Last year, however, those two sources raised only £7 million. That is less than half the total of identifiable public expenditure in Scotland and less than a third of total Government expenditure in Scotland.<br><br>
Where is the rest to come from? We should be told. Would that huge funding gap be filled by English taxpayers, who already spend 25 per cent. more on us than they do on themselves? Would it be filled by the European Community, to which a Scottish Parliament would make us less accessible and to which the UK is already a net contributor? Would it be filled by borrowing, which would have to be paid for, or would it come from the dear old International Monetary Fund—a friend of the previous Labour Government?<br><br>
The fact is that a Scottish Parliament would run out of benefactors. It would run out of soft options. It would quickly run out of money. The taxpayers of Scotland would pay. No wonder Professor Arthur Midwinter, one of the gurus of the Labour party, spoke recently of instability and disillusionment.<br><br>
The shadow Chancellor admits to an extra 3p in the pound on income tax. Uniquely in the United Kingdom, we Scots would pay a higher rate. We would pay an extra £442 for a Scottish police constable—£442 more than your English counterparts; an extra £585 for a primary school head teacher—£585 more than our counterparts in Wales; and so on right across the board. But 3p extra in the pound would raise only £432 million, or 4 per cent. of my Scottish Office budget for next year. That would not go far. It is 3p in the pound for starters. Labour's new pay roll tax to take £80 million out of Scottish businesses—a tax on jobs—would be 0·5 per cent. of the pay roll for starters. The uniform business rate, towards which we have so far secured £330 million to bring it down to the United Kingdom average, would disappear, as every council lets rip once the protection of capping is abolished.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0035">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
The Scottish National party complains about business rates being higher in Scotland than elsewhere in the United Kingdom, but that is the only tax that is not under the control of the United Kingdom Government. That tax is high because local authorities in Scotland spend 30 per cent. more per head than is spent south of the border, despite higher subsidies being paid from the United Kingdom Parliament than are paid to local authorities in England. That is a glimpse of the sort of tax burdens that a separate Scotland or, indeed, a Scotland with a separate Scottish Parliament would face. The Leader of the Opposition said that
<br><blockquote><p>"The proponents of devolution must specify the full financial, social and political costs … they must prove the need for accepting these costs".</p></blockquote>
For once, he was right. In a range of ways, a Scottish Parliament would run amok among the business and individual taxpayers of Scotland to fund policies that would bring Scotland to her knees.<br><br>
It need not be like that. There is no room to destroy the Union or to damage Scotland's place in it. There is no need to offer a cure for which there is no known disease. The hon. Member for Garscadden said in the Usher hall:
<br><blockquote><p>"I think Scotland is alive, and I think it's flourishing."</p></blockquote>
He is right. Within the Union we have had 300 years of progress and growing prosperity. The Union has done us proud. During this Parliament, under this Government, and within the United Kingdom Scotland has achieved all-time records on manufacturing output, investment, employment, exports and living standards. The Opposition's proposals would undo all that. They want to erect economic barriers and to create a two-tier, two-geared economic policy for the United Kingdom that would make Scotland the loser. The convention proposals are superficial, trivial and facile. For short-term, self-serving reasons, the Labour party is putting Scotland's long-term future at risk. The Labour party wants to have its cake and to eat it, but the cake is half-baked.<br><br>
We should throw these proposals aside and stay, where we belong as of right, a full and equal partner within the United Kingdom.</span></p>
<p>10.59 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Somehow, Mr. Martin, I am not inspired by what I heard just now. I thought that it was a narrow, negative speech. There was no vision and no feeling for the problems of Scotland. The Secretary of State for Scotland sounded like a man determined to discover difficulties that are not there. I was interested in his description of Lord Home of the Hirsel still searching. It occurs to me that the present Secretary of State for Scotland has given up the search. That is a tragedy for his party and a disaster for the future.<br><br>
I am not surprised that the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth), the Minister of State—if the newspapers are correct—has decided to import the right hon. Member for Finchley (Mrs. Thatcher) in a desperate effort to save his seat. He will certainly not get any internal help judging by this morning's performance.<br><br>
The Secretary of State mentioned the onus of proof. When lawyers talk about the onus of proof—I speak as a lawyer—they usually mean that their clients are guilty and they are desperately hoping that the facts will not emerge. That sums up the Government's case.<br><br>
The constitutional convention proposals have been endorsed by the Labour party. We have been prepared to talk to fellow Scots about the future of the country. Other
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
parties have not. The Liberal Democrats have been fully involved. They have assented to the scheme. That is why the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) will—appropriately—close the debate for the Opposition.<br><br>
The constitutional convention has made a tremendous contribution to the debate on Scotland's future. Those who have stood on the sidelines hoping for its failure are less than convincing as critics. The convention has brought together politicians, but—as importantly—it has involved many other interests, and Scots whose qualification is a wish to contribute. The scheme commands respect for that reason. It is the product of debate and not a collection of slogans.<br><br>
Those who have come late to the debate find it hard to connect with the argument. The Prime Minister illustrated that in his speech at the weekend. The right hon. Gentleman made a concession and I wish to underline that. He recognised that many felt that the Government in London had been too remote from the people of Scotland and that too little regard has been paid to the separate identity of Scotland. However, the Prime Minister is like a doctor who can describe the complaint but cannot prescribe a cure.<br><br>
As the Prime Minister has identified the problem, it is odd that the Secretary of State should stand here and say that there is no known disease. There is a problem and the discontent is beginning to dominate the political life of Scotland. There was no positive proposal of any sort in the Prime Minister's speech; he has that in common with the Secretary of State. All that comes from the Tory party is vague talk of evolutionary change—change that is imperceptible, if it happens at all, and is spread over aeons of time.<br><br>
Speculation will continue. The Prime Minister addressed a small gathering of party faithful, who were handpicked, but—as we were told by a prominent Conservative prospective parliamentary candidate later—more than a third disagreed with what the Prime Minister said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Rubbish. Nonsense.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is what the leader of the Tory group on Glasgow district council said. His comments are reflected in the opinion polls that have been taken among Conservative party candidates and Conservative activists.<br><br>
There has been speculation since the Prime Minister's speech. In one newspaper this morning, it was stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Prime Minister has already laid provisional plans to move from the status quo."</p></blockquote>
Another newspaper tells us that he has decided to "play it both ways". All the newspapers have centred on the key phrase that the Prime Minister used in an interview. He said that he will "take stock after the election". There we have it—a great constitutional debate reduced to the politics of the corner shop. It is simply dishonest. One cannot tinker with the constitution and flirt with constitutional change on the turn of half a dozen seats.<br><br>
Even the present Government and the present Prime Minister must realise the need for a basis of principle. Too many Scots remember Douglas Home's pledge that told them to vote no in the referendum and get a better form of devolution later. That has resulted in the right hon. Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale (Mr. Lang) as the Secretary of State. What an apology; what an anti-climax.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0036">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
If the Prime Minister knows what he means, he should say what he means. In a leader this morning the <i>Daily Record</i> stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"He can't be as daft as he made out".</p></blockquote>
On present performance that is a charitable assumption.<br><br>
The Prime Minister said that the Scottish question was "a running sore". That is an unpleasant metaphor. A running sore is something that you dab with ointment and hope that it will go away. Unless we get a Government with ideas and the ability and commitment to tackle the problem, that running sore will not go away. It will plague the United Kingdom and damage every one of us.<br><br>
The Labour party will put forward positive proposals that we believe can be implemented within the next few weeks. The proposals are tailored to Scotland's needs and are designed to reform the United Kingdom. We want to deal with the problem that the Prime Minister identified. We have the answers that he cannot find.<br><br>
The essence of our plan—I am not surprised that the Secretary of State avoided the real point of the argument—is that Scotland should have the power that matters in a democracy, the power to make law. That power is justified by Scotland's long-standing and distinct traditions, which are legal, cultural and political. The Scottish Office is already in place. The 7,000-plus civil servants are in place. That vast machine should be under democratic control. It should reflect Scotland's agenda directly. It does not under the present system.<br><br>
Devolution is not a theoretical abstraction. It is not an academic argument. Scots live every day with the practical consequences of the present constitutional absurdity. More and more, people ask why the right hon. Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale is Secretary of State when almost no one votes for him.<br><br>
We have paid a high price. We have had the poll tax—the most hated tax in living memory—forced down our throats by a band of zealots who have been rejected again and again at the ballot box. Hospitals have been bullied into opting out of the mainstream health service against the overwhelming wish of the people. We have had legislation to allow schools to opt out—hardly a roaring success—but that is a measure designed to foster division, not to improve the future for our young people.<br><br>
Those issues cannot be shrugged off. If the Government tell my constituents that control over housing, education and local government does not matter, my constituents will say that the Government are mad. It is a matter not of a Parliament with those powers being in the second division but of a Parliament dealing with most of the issues that affect the quality of life in the constituencies of everyone of us. It would ensure that the programme for the legislative framework reflected the wishes of Scotland. If we have a separate stream of Scottish legislation at Westminster and the devolved administration of the Scottish Office, what conceivable democratic argument can there be against putting that under the control of the electorate of Scotland?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In July 1989 the hon. Gentleman signed the Claim of Right, which said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The United Kingdom is a political artefact put together at English insistence."</p></blockquote>
I take it that that is still his veiw.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I signed the Claim of Right because I believe that the people of Scotland have a right to decide their future. I challenge the hon. Gentleman to deny the common sense or the justice of that proposition—<i>[Interruption.]</i> If we are now being told in strange animal noises from the Minister of State and others that the people of Scotland have not got that right, that is odd. My disagreement with Scottish nationalists is that I do not believe that that right should be exercised in the way that they would choose.<br><br>
The essence of my case is that if there is to be a change in health policy it should be decided by Scots in Scotland. If there is to be a change in education policy, it should be decided by the whole of Scotland, not by unrepresentative politicians who happen to be Scots. As well as legislative power, the Parliament must have an industrial and economic remit.<br><br>
Labour's plans would give the Scottish Parliament the power to build a modern economy. The areas that matter, as European competition policy bites, are training, the skills gap, the infrastructure and industrial investment. They are necessary to release the energy of the people, to back the workers and to contribute more effectively to the overall performance of the United Kingdom. Many of our successful competitors have built prosperity on the basis of a system that Tory Ministers condemn as a recipe for disaster. I still remember the bizarre spectacle of the Secretary of State lecturing the Bavarians about the virtues of a unitary state.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lang</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Barbarians play rugby.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Bavarians. If the Secretary of State does not remember where he was speaking only a few months ago, I cannot help him.<br><br>
Events in Europe make nonsense of the Secretary of State's claim that a Scottish Parliament of the sort outlined in the convention scheme woulud have no status in Europe. The Länder and Spanish autonomous provinces—the Secretary of State cannot slip out of this one by saying that Spain is a federal state—have growing influence in the European Community, building alliances and creating links. Scotland can and must be part of that process. We must catch the mood of Europe, and that is part of our scheme.<br><br>
Our scheme is secure and provides a practical financial base for the new Parliament that allows scope for continuing innovation. The United Kingdom is a partnership. Why should that be attacked by Ministers? It is a partnership in which resources are pooled and allocated on the basis of need. That system has served Scotland well and has the merit of being based on equity and justice.<br><br>
If the Secretary of State believes that grievances will emerge as a result of a devolved structure in Scotland, he has not understood the mood of Britain as a whole: the interest in breaking the power of centralised government and the need for movement in other parts of the United Kingdom. There will be no sympathy for the hints, nods, threats and insinuations that if there is reform of the structure of the United Kingdom in response to an overwhelming wish in Scotland, there will be a penalty to pay through the breaking of equalisation of resources and allocation on the basis of need. The Secretary of State is shifty on that matter. He keeps referring to the possibility and suggests that it will happen but he will not say whether
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0037">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
he would fight to stop it, or whether he accepts my case that it would be disastrous for Scotland and the whole United Kingdom.<br><br>
The scheme makes provision for a Scottish Parliament to vary income tax rates up or down within a defined range. That has been the subject of near hysterical attack—the concept is too complex for the average Conservative Minister to grasp. The Secretary of State must have been advised that misrepresentation can flourish in respect of that provision. He richly earned the rebuke of the then vice-president of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Association, who complained that Ministers were going round Scotland spreading fear like a flu virus. The Scottish Parliament will be answerable to the Scottish people for its actions. If it decides to increase the financial take to fund improvements in the health service or higher education, it must account for that decision to the people of Scotland. The Opposition see nothing wrong in that—it is called democracy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker <span class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On that fundamental point, does the hon. Gentleman agree that, under a Scottish Parliament, the bulk of the money coming to Scotland would still come from central taxation, collected and distributed from London? If that is so, the money will be controlled by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who will be answerable to the United Kingdom Parliament in London. Negotiations will be inevitable because every Finance Bill must be debated in Westminster.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman gives the impression that every penny spent by the Exchequer in Scotland is a hand-out or subsidy. We pay direct and indirect taxes. The hon. Gentleman is right to this extent, as I made clear, if he had been listening. Resources are pooled and then allocated on the basis of need. That is what partnership is about—equalisation of resources. That happens in many European countries with devolved administrations and will happen in the European Community itself. Of course there will be negotiations. Is the hon. Gentleman so naive as to believe that there are none now? I hold to the principle that our affairs should be run so that resources are allocated on the basis of need. How can a party that claims to believe in the Union fail to accept that essential principle?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sillars</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the realm of real politics, there are often divisions over the measurement of need. That happens inside Scotland between local authorities and the Scottish Office, even under a Labour Government. What if there were a disagreement about need between the Scottish Parliament and the Treasury in London? The right hon. and learned Member for Monklands, East (Mr. Smith) has said that borrowing consent will be controlled from London. Could not a United Kingdom Chancellor of the Exchequer frustrate a devolved Scottish Parliament on the critical matter of borrowing powers?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are always limitations on government. Even if the hon. Gentleman's dream of a separate Scotland came true, the Scottish Parliament could be frustrated by the rules of the European Community. Many of the hon. Gentleman's promises are impractical within the European Community but he would not stay outside Europe to ensure pristine independence so that he could sit in the wilderness unreconstructed, uninhibited and untouched by what other people do.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
The Secretary of State's principal objection to the convention scheme boils down to this: he does not trust the Scots. That being so, he can hardly be surprised if they do not trust him. It is depressing that he agonises over the impact of a Scottish Parliament on the rest of the United Kingdom but never considers the damage that the inflexibility and insensitivity of the present system do to Scotland.<br><br>
Ministers assume that a Scottish Parliament will in all circumstances act irresponsibly. They assume that the United Kingdom is incapable of accommodating a devolved Parliament and predict that it will end in bitterness and jealousy. The Germans have decentralised power successfully. Other countries have used diferent models to follow suit. Why do Tories insist that we do not have the maturity to cope? Is that the Government's depressing judgment on Scotland and the whole United Kingdom? If they regard Scots, and their fellow citizens, with such contempt they can hardly be surprised if the feeling is reciprocated.<br><br>
A year ago, the Prime Minister claimed that a Parliament without financial powers would be "a bogus sham". Does he still believe that? If he has suppressed that view or no longer believes it, why has he done so?<br><br>
Any settlement must carry consent. We believe that the convention proposals have assent from the people of Scotland. There is a mood for change in every sector of the community. Even the world of industry and commerce does not give the idea the absolute thumbs down, as the Minister claimed, but is beginning to examine critically the Government's scare stories. The president of the CBI in Scotland last week said that
<br><blockquote><p>"some change is inevitable and many see it as desirable."</p></blockquote>
Those views echo a wider mood that will not be denied.<br><br>
Last week, there was a different sort of poll. It was kindly arranged by the Secretary of State at the expense of the Tory party. Those sampled were asked about the Labour party's proposals. The poll reported a clear majority in favour of our proposals for a Scottish Parliament. Support was not confined to Labour voters. Two thirds of declared SNP supporters back our plans.<br><br>
The constitutional convention sought and found backing far broader than the support for any one party. Its success is characterised by the decision to move from first past the post to an electoral system that will give an effective voice to all areas and all significant strands of Scottish opinion. Whether a person is a Labour voter in the borders, a Tory in the highlands or a Liberal in west central Scotland, that person's vote will count.<br><br>
Our plans are suited to Scotland's needs and can be implemented now. In a few weeks time we can have a Labour Government. We can defeat the Tories and end their rule in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom. In a year's time the Scottish Parliament Bill can be on the statute book. No one else can offer that prospect and be believed. Scotland does not want separatism; it does not want to pull the shutters down on Britain. It does not want disruption, dislocation and uncertainty, whether about allocating the national debt, the negotiations with Europe or the disentangling of the pension and social security systems.<br><br>
Scotland does not want to turn the rest of the United Kingdom into a foreign country. The Labour party does not want to break up Britain. That is not just because it would be bad for Scotland, but because we are part of the wider Labour movement that recognises common

problems throughout this island. There is a desperate need for a national minimum wage to end the scandal of low pay, but it is a scandal both north and south of the border. There is a desperate need to improve our health service to close the gap between those who have and those who have not in every part of the United Kingdom. There is the same desperate need for jobs, training and investment in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Leeds, Sheffield and Liverpool.<br><br>
The Labour party will extend democracy to Scotland and fight social injustice throughout the country. We will not turn our back on poverty or hardship simply because it is happening in Newcastle or Manchester. The Labour party's plans—the convention scheme—provide the best way forward. They are challenging, radical and right. They offer the advantages of home rule without the disadvantages of separatism. There is no point in this modern age of erecting the sort of barriers that other countries are struggling to dismantle. The Tories and the nationalists will unite on one thing—they will tell Scotland that the choice is between the status quo and the break-up of Britain. It is not true. We will reform the system. Scots will be governed by representatives whom they will elect. We will retain our links with the other countries that make up the United Kingdom. That is the way forward. We can begin now to build a better future for Scotland and a better future for Britain.</span></p>
<p>11.22 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alex Salmond <span class='memberconstituency'>(Banff and Buchan)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: A number of features of the debate so far have interested me. First, the Secretary of State should remember that not answering questions is something that always comes back to haunt Scottish politicians. He will not be allowed to get away with not telling us how many times he has led a delegation from the United Kingdom to the Council of Ministers. That will emerge as the Galloway question to rival the West Lothian question in Scottish politics.<br><br>
Another remarkable feature of the speeches today is that both the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) and the Secretary of State propose solutions for the constitution of Scotland that are inherently unstable. Whatever else may be said about the convention and the devolved scheme, it would be an unstable form of government for Scotland. There are bound to be boundary wars between the Assembly in Edinburgh and the Parliament in Westminster as the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) and the Tory party try to move powers back to Westminster, and the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) and other Liberal Democrats—who may not be in Parliament now but might be in an Assembly—try to move powers to Edinburgh. It would be a recipe for instability.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Galloway <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Hillhead)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Salmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will forgive me, I should like to develop my points and then give way to him.<br><br>
The form of government that is being proposed is inherently unstable, but the status quo is also inherently unstable. We have had high-level political debates on the constitution of Scotland for the past 27 years. The Secretary of State thinks that he kicked off the debate last November, but it has been a major theme for many people
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
in Scottish politics for the past 27 years. Over that period, progressively fewer people have believed the status quo to be an acceptable form of government. The revelation in the BBC "Scottish Lobby" programme yesterday that the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) would after all serve on a Select Committee on Scottish Affairs in the next Parliament will not drive people to join those who support the status quo. Whether he wishes to serve on that Committee in the next Parliament is likely to be rather an academic question.<br><br>
Both the convention scheme and the status quo are inherently unstable forms of government. That contrasts heavily with the proposal for independence in Europe, which offers both stability and prosperity for the people of Scotland. It offers stability because there are few examples in recent world history of countries becoming independent and then moving back to sacrifice that independence. Independence in Europe offers Scotland the stability that we seek.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galloway</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman mentioned the Galloway question, perhaps he would answer this question from Galloway. There would undoubtedly be boundary wars between a home rule Parliament in Edinburgh and a Goverment in Westminster, just as there are boundary wars between the democratic majority here and the minority which sits in Government. How many boundary wars would there be between the red Clyde-built revolutionary Scottish Government and the capitalist club in the EEC to which the Scottish National party is utterly committed?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Salmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman argues that it is not possible to have a social democratic or, indeed, a socialist Government within the context of the European Community he had better inform all those states in the EC who have exactly that form of government. The difference within the European confederal context is that Scottish representatives would be at the Council of Ministers where the big decisions are made and they would help to shape those decisions, instead of what happens at present. The Secretary of State still has not told us how many times he has been allowed to ever be part of the United Kingdom delegation.<br><br>
The difficulties of both the Labour and Conservative parties on this question have been illustrated by the doctrines that have emerged over the past few weeks. I was in the "Left, Right and Centre" studio when the Cook doctrine was enunciated. The only thing that the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) has done wrong is to be caught telling the truth. It would be difficult to justify a Member of the Westminster Parliament representing a Scottish constituency, having policy responsibility over areas that had been devolved to a Scottish Assembly. What has not grabbed people's attention is the remarkable fact that the hon. Gentleman seems to be debarring himself from being the Secretary of State for Health in either England or Scotland. He cannot be the Secretary of State for Health in England or Wales because he has debarred himself, but he cannot be the Secretary of State for Health in Scotland because he will stand for the Westminster Parliament, not the Scottish Assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: So far, the hon. Gentleman has attacked the convention scheme with vim and vigour and has made some rather spurious points. May I ask him a simple
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0039">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
question? In the next Parliament, if he is faced with the prospect of no change or the convention scheme, for which will he vote?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Salmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon. Gentleman does not want to be reminded of the Usher hall debate, but I shall give him the answer that I gave him that night. We will go into the election with the aim of winning a majority of Scottish seats to win a mandate for Scottish independence. There might be circumstances in which we find ourselves voting for an inadequate devolution scheme, but never again will the Scottish National party enunciate another party's policies.<br><br>
May I ask the hon. Gentleman a question? It has been suggested that a plan B is developing in the Conservative party. After the election, when the Prime Minister has had a chance to take stock, he will offer a devolution scheme because of the poor performance of the Conservative party in Scotland. The price to be paid, according to the chairman of the Tory party, the right hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Patten), is a cut in the number of Members of Parliament from Scotland. Would the hon. Gentleman back such a devolution scheme if proposed by the Conservative party?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The answer is no, but I am interested to know that the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan has been authorised to speak on behalf of the Prime Minister. I certainly do not know what the Prime Minister's plans are. If they take that form, the answer will be no.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Salmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the hon. Member for Garscadden on giving a clear answer. No doubt when the debate is summed up we will have an equally clear answer from the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce), who has apparently said on the record that the number of Scottish Members of Parliament would be negotiable. The Cook doctrine has blown a substantial hole in the arguments of the convention, but no more acceptable to the people of Scotland is the Heathcoat-Amory doctrine as enunciated on Saturday night. I thought that Kenny Macintyre, the redoubtable correspondent of the BBC in Scotland, forced the question very well when the junior Energy Minister said to him that he could see nothing "constitutionally impertinent or wrong" in staffing the Scottish Office with English Conservative Members of Parliament. I see little difference between staffing the Scottish Office with red-blooded English men like the junior Energy Minister or with Sudeten Scots from Southend, Winchester or elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, North-East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman believe that he enhances the debate by describing people as "Sudeten Scots"? Does not that confirm the view of many of us that the attitude of the hon. Gentleman and his supporters is not so much pro-Scottish as anti-English?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Salmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hear the word "racist" from the Labour Benches. As some Labour Members will know, in using the words "Sudeten Scots" I was quoting the late Lord Ross of Marnock who employed the term to good effect to describe Scottish Tories who had sought refuge in English constituencies. I have heard the late Lord Ross of Marnock described as many things, but I am greatly surprised to hear him described, by implication, as a racist by Labour Members.<br><br>
In policy terms, the doctrine of the Under-Secretary of State for Energy may not make too much difference. I can
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
see little difference between English Conservative policies being imposed by puppets like the Secretary of State for Scotland or the Minister of State, the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth), or a full-blooded colonial regime in the Scottish Office of the sort suggested by the Under-Secretary of State for Energy. However, the Scottish people are more likely to find it fundamentally unacceptable than "constitutionally impertinent."<br><br>
I hope to hear from Conservative Members an elaboration of the point made by the Secretary of State for Scotland that he would find nothing wrong with the Scottish Office being staffed by representatives from English constituencies. That seems to me to be at least as big a constitutional gaffe from the ranks of the Conservative party as that perpetrated by the hon. Member for Livingston from the ranks of the Labour party.<br><br>
That leads to the conclusion that the people of Scotland should respond to the gauntlet flung down by the Prime Minister on Saturday when he said, clearly and willingly, that if people in Scotland vote for independence that is exactly what they will achieve. That will be far more attractive than enduring the prospect of colonial rule by the Scottish Office.<br><br>
As the Secretary of State said in the Usher hall debate, that colonial rule would be justified by incorporating the votes of everyone who votes Labour and Liberal Democrat in the coming election on the ground that they have voted for the Union and, therefore, for the right of the Secretary of State, even as Lord Lang of Galloway, to run his Department with English Conservative Members used to make up the numbers. Independence is to be preferred to any patched-up devolution scheme—the plan B that the chairman of the Conservative party is devising—offered to Scots, with the objective not of improving the government of Scotland but of splitting the Labour party asunder. It would be far more satisfactory for the people of Scotland to opt for national independence and self-respect in the coming general election.<br><br>
The convention scheme is fundamentally flawed and I want to discuss four areas that illustrate that. First, the scheme offers no real economic control for Scotland as more than 90 per cent. of the funding of a Scottish Parliament will be non-discretionary and it will not be able to control its funding. That is a smaller percentage than Strathclyde regional council has at present, even given the low level of contribution from poll tax. Therefore, if a Scottish Parliament is to deal with the social needs of Scotland, it will be faced with the invidious choice of robbing Peter to pay Paul when both face inadequate funding at present. Certainly, there can be no long-term protection against punitive financial raids by a future hostile Westminster Government, perhaps with the hon. Member for Stirling rematerialising as one of the "Sudeten Scots" in an English constituency.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John McFall <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is probably aware that Sweden had to raise its interest rates by 6 per cent. in November to defend its currency. Given that the Scottish National party is suggesting a single currency—which would be a petro currency—does he believe that speculators in the market would keep away from a Scottish currency? Would it be allowed to remain as a stable currency or would it be subject to speculation? The hon. Gentleman's economics are sheer, utter
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0040">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
nonsense. Scotland is part of the European Economic Community, so that currency would be subject to such intense speculation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Salmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman is referring to a single currency or to a Scottish currency. However, if we are to talk about speculation and currencies that are vulnerable to movements in the international capital market, there is no better example than the investment currency or "banana currency" of sterling. The history of monetary policy in Scotland over the past four to five years is that we have had to pay an interest rate premium because of the weak position of sterling.<br><br>
If Scotland had had the European average of interest rates since 1988, it would be in a much better position. If the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) intends seriously to argue to the people of Scotland, in the business community and elsewhere, that it is right and proper for the Scottish economy, which does not suffer from over-heating, to pay a premium to defend sterling against international speculators in the exchange rate mechanism, he will receive a dusty answer. Most people would prefer the lower European level of interest rates that would be achievable first within the context of an independent Scottish currency.<br><br>
My second point about the weakness of the convention scheme relates to entrenchment. Labour Members must be very careful in the next few weeks because I understand from the "Scottish Lobby" programme shown yesterday that the hon. Member for Linlithgow discovered the word "entrenchment" last Monday when he examined the convention scheme. Knowing the hon. Gentleman as I do, I have no doubt that we shall hear a great deal about that matter in the run-up to the general election.<br><br>
I do not believe that the hon. Member for Linlithgow has much to worry about because the idea that powers can be protected from the Westminster Parliament is at best a mirage and at worst a total deception. The convention parties are trying simultaneously to ride the horses of parliamentary sovereignty at Westminster and popular sovereignty in Scotland. That trick cannot be performed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thomas Graham <span class='memberconstituency'>(Renfrew, West and Inverclyde)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman aware that in my constituency a Scottish National party candidate is saying that his party will grant an amnesty for non-payment of poll tax. Obviously, I am against the poll tax, but is it also part of the financial policy of the SNP to tell those poor people in my constituency who paid their poll tax that their money will be refunded? Is that to be part of the SNP's financial package and budget?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Salmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Our policy is that those people who were required to pay 20 per cent. of poll tax should never have been asked to pay it and should not now have to pay it.<br><br>
To return to my point about entrenchment, is it possible to defend the powers of a Scottish Parliament within the context of the Assembly scheme? I do not believe that it is and that is why it is possible for the convention scheme to have the simultaneous support of someone like Bob McCreadie, who sees it as a route to end the Union, and someone like Canon Kenyon Wright, who sees it as a route to defend the Union. There is simultaneous support of the scheme by two people with wholly diverse viewpoints.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
The Westminster Parliament depends on the concept of its total sovereignty. How on earth can one argue that it is possible to protect a Parliament set up as a subsidiary body in Scotland from a punitive raid on not only its finances but its powers by a Westminster Parliament—the very Parliament that the Labour party tells us is totally supreme? What Parliament gives, Parliament can take away. That is a fundamental flaw of any devolution proposal.<br><br>
Thirdly, on the question of Europe—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has mentioned several people who support the idea of a Scottish Assembly and their differences of opinion. Will he explain to the Committee why Isobel Lindsay, a long-standing nationalist—a member of the Scottish National party when the hon. Member for Dunfermline, West (Mr. Douglas) was on the right wing of the Labour party and the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Sillars) was the author of the pamphlet "Don't Butcher Scotland's Future"—not only supports the convention's proposals, but is chairman of the campaign for a Scottish Assembly?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Salmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The simple answer is because she is wrong. <i>[Laughter.]</i> The Scottish National party, by huge majorities, has endorsed the concept of independence in Europe. The hon. Gentleman must not ask us to come to his rescue and defend Labour party policies. The fact that the Members for Dunfermline, West and for Govan have reached the conclusion that independence in Europe is the best way forward for Scotland means that they are following the trend in Scottish opinion which—as even the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes) must recognise—has been moving towards independence in Europe.<br><br>
Of course, the hon. Gentleman is remarkable as one of the very few people in Scottish politics to have retreated on the constitutional position over the past few years. In the year 1982–83, he was termed one of the "dogs of war", who would play Parnell with the Westminster Parliament and bring the proceedings of Westminster to a halt unless a Scottish Parliament was conceded. I see that the hon. Gentleman is nodding. Now, he sits tamely on the Benches as the Labour party spokesman on foreign affairs enjoying the privileges of that position and we hear nothing about bringing the Westminster Parliament to its knees. The hon. Gentleman may not have brought the Westminster Parliament to its knees, but I have certainly brought him to his feet.<br><br>
I was talking about the weakness of the convention's scheme in the European context. We have seen the crystallisation and, in that crystallisation, the weakness of the nebulous concept of a Europe of the regions. Clause 198 of the Maastricht treatise states that a Europe of the regions will mean a committee of a committee, a subsidiary advisory committee along with the economic and social committee, which is in itself an advisory committee, on which Scotland might, if we are very lucky, get three members out of 189. How can that be proposed as a substitute for direct decision making and real access to power within the European Community?<br><br>
Let us imagine what would have happened if there had been an Assembly in Edinburgh and the Prime Minister had been to Maastricht with the intention of sabotaging the social charter—which is supported, I suspect, by 80 or 90 per cent. of Scottish people. Let us imagine that he took with him the hon. Member for Falkirk, West (Mr.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0041">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
Canavan) to represent the views of the Scottish Assembly. Is it credible that, in the middle of the negotiations, the Prime Minister, in trying to sabotage the social development of Europe, would have turned to the hon. Member for Falkirk, West and said, "Before I make a final decision, can I ask you what the Scottish Assembly wants me to do about this important question"? There cannot be joint decision making in the event of a split of opinion between the Scottish Assembly and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. If there is, there will be no doubt about who will win.<br><br>
Let us take the other issue being debated in Maastricht—the question of the Eurofed. We are debating in Edinburgh, which, with Glasgow and Perth, represents the second largest concentration of financial power in the entire European Community, in terms of assets under management. What do the parties sitting here have to say about the Eurofed? The Labour party is committed, in its national executive documents, to campaigning to bring the Eurofed to London. On a radio programme before Christmas, the Secretary of State told me that he liked the idea of campaigning for the Eurofed to be brought to Edinburgh, but we do not know if that is Cabinet policy because the Cabinet does not seem to want to campaign for the Eurofed anywhere in the United Kingdom. Would not it have been simpler if a Scottish representative had gone to Maastricht to argue the case for the Eurofed being sited in Edinburgh, the capital city of Scotland and a major European financial centre?<br><br>
We must do something about the present situation in which it is deemed acceptable for a Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the right hon. Member for Watford (Mr. Garel-Jones), to speak in private meetings to Members of the European Parliament and run down Scotland, describing it as "oversubsidised and over-represented", and also to insult other Europeans, describing them as "frogs". The explanation from the Foreign Office about the remarks of the Minister of State was that they did not matter because they were made in a private meeting. Apparently, it is of no consequence if Scotland is run down and other Europeans are insulted, as long as it takes place in a private meeting. I think that it is important that Scots are paying the salaries of those who go to Europe, not to represent Scotland, but to misrepresent it; not to build bridges with other Europeans, but to run us down and to run them down. That situation cannot be solved by the proposals of the constitutional convention.<br><br>
I come to the question of defence policy, a subject which has been raised during the past few days. I find it absolutely extraordinary that the Secretary of State for Defence should come to Scotland and use the subject as an argument for continuing the Union. Is not he aware that his Department represents the biggest regional policy of any Government Department in favour of the south-east and south-west of England? In the Ministry of Defence, there are 80,170 non-industrial staff, 44·4 per cent. of whom are based in the south-east of England, 22·2 per cent. in the south-west of England and only 7·3 per cent. in Scotland.<br><br>
Of the near £10,000 million procurement budget of the Ministry of Defence, 42·5 per cent. goes to companies in the south-east of England, 15·5 per cent. to companies in the south-west of England, and just over 7 per cent. to companies in Scotland. Of 4,500 approved defence contractors, only 250 are in Scotland. In overall
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
expenditure, the Government spend £473 per head in the south of England on defence, compared with £274 in Scotland. The clear message of those figures is that an independent Scotland could substantially cut its defence commitments and still it would have no net effect on jobs in Scotland because of the imbalance in current Government expenditure and the use of the defence budget as a means of reinforcing the economy of the south-east of England.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Salmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will not give way to the hon. Gentleman because I have refused to give way to other hon. Members. We are under a time constraint, and I have promised to try to abide by it.<br><br>
It is remarkable that Labour Members in Scotland who say that they are against the Trident system are now arguing that the way to get rid of the system is to vote for the Labour party—a party committed to deploying the Trident nuclear system. How would members of a Scottish Assembly feel, perhaps sitting in this Chamber, when Trident comes to the River Clyde, if the convention Assembly had no power to exercise the majority wish of the Scottish people and keep that monstrous weapon off Scottish soil?<br><br>
My analysis of the convention's claims regarding finance, its powers, its European role and defence might be regarded in some quarters as somewhat partial. So, it might be as well to leave the final word to those who advocate that system of government and discover their real opinion of the Parliament that they propose for Scotland. Who will serve in that Parliament? Clearly, it will not be the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) or the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg) who, on 7 October 1990, told <i>Scotland on Sunday</i> that he would be
<br><blockquote><p>"the wrong age for the new Parliament."</p></blockquote>
It will not be the shadow Chancellor sitting here today who, on 30 September 1991, told <i>The Scotsman:</i>
<br><blockquote><p>"Had I been starting out in politics, I would be strongly tempted to go to the Scottish Parliament. But I am not starting out in politics."</p></blockquote>
Clearly, there is an age bar in the Scottish Parliament—except, of course, for the hon. Member for Dunfermline, East (Mr. Brown)—<i>[Interruption.]</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is entitled to a hearing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He is going on a bit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Salmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Dunfermline, East also told <i>Scotland on Sunday:</i>
<br><blockquote><p>"I'm sure they'll want younger people than me in the Scottish Assembly".</p></blockquote>
That grand old man of Labour politics has reached the ripe old age of 41. I am reminded of the words of the former leader of the Labour party, the right hon. Member for Blaenau Gwent (Mr. Foot), who labelled the right hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Sir. D. Steel) as having moved from young hopeful to elder statesman with no intervening period whatsoever. That would be an appropriate description of the hon. Member for Dunfermline, East.<br><br>
The brightest and best of Labour's Scottish contingent are voting with their feet. They are voting to go to Westminster, not to a Scottish Assembly. If they believe that this is the powerhouse Scotland that the Labour party claims, why are they not queueing up to come to a Scottish
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0042">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
Parliament, which would have real influence and power? The Labour party A-team knows that under its proposals real power, influence and decision making will lie in the Westminster Parliament.<br><br>
Scotland has had enough of being a prisoner of conscience in the Westminster parliamentary structure. The convention scheme offers no escape route whatsoever for Scotland. At the coming general election the Scottish people will have the opportunity to choose real decision making in Scotland and real influence in the European Community. In massive numbers they will vote for a new Scotland in that new Europe.</span></p>

It is perhaps worth reminding ourselves that the vast majority of the Committee is convinced that the Union is the best way of governing Scotland within Britain. The argument between the two sides is how that is best done.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond) gave us an interesting illustration of the height of the stakes that lie behind the argument. He is passionately against the Union, as he is entitled to be. He does not like or want it, and he does not want it to succeed. Whether it is under the scheme of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), or my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State—[HON. MEMBERS: "What scheme?"]—I shall not keep within my 10 minutes if I do not keep moving. Everything that the Union does will be criticised out of the window by the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan and his friends. He is entitled to do that, but we must assess the weight of his words against that background. Nothing that the Union could do would win his approval.<br><br>
The case that I intend to argue has not had a proper hearing. I do not say that everyone should agree with it, but it would be deplorable if we went through this debate and the general debate in Scotland and reached a conclusion without the argument being put. The argument is this: if the Union is essential to the prosperity of the islands in which we live, the present scheme advocated by the Labour party and the Scottish Constitutional Convention, which was no doubt devised with good intentions, would be unworkable as it stands.<br><br>
That is an important point but, from what the hon. Member for Garscadden and other Opposition Members have said this morning, it does not seem to be recognised. Until it is recognised, the scheme cannot be supported by people in Scotland who want to keep the Union or who realise that change is necessary but know that it is no use supporting a change if it will not work. Whatever one's views about the Union or the present system, any scheme that is a bad option should not be supported. I am not prepared to support a scheme that is not logical or workable as it stands.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman is bidding to be the Sir Alec Douglas-Home of 1992. The most interesting thing that he said were the words, "as it stands". Is he about to tell us the improvements and modifications that he would suggest to make the convention's scheme workable?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Younger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to that. Let me say in passing—I am sure that I will be believed much more widely than just in the Committee—there is no Scot to whom I would rather be compared than Lord Home. He is a highly respected person, as the hon. and learned Gentleman would, no doubt, agree.<br><br>
I want to explain why the scheme proposed by the Scottish Constitutional Convention could not work. I ask hon. Members to imagine it in existence and working in the day-to-day progress of policy and government. Let us consider how it would have to operate in the present political system. First, there is the question of the roles of Scottish Members of Parliament. I could not support any scheme that would reduce the number of Scottish Members of Parliament. That would be wrong. If we are to remain in the United Kingdom we require the full number of Scottish Members of Parliament to deal with United Kingdom subjects.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ron Brown <span class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, Leith)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Younger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must get on. If the scheme led to any reduction in the number of Scottish Members of Parliament, I could not support it. That would be extremely dangerous.<br><br>
Connected with that is the question of Ministers with Scottish constituencies. The point raised by the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) is unanswered. It is a devastating point. The party in power must be able to give ministerial posts to those whom it wishes to hold those posts. If some were excluded from holding posts—for example, the hon. Member for Livingston, the right hon. and learned Member for Monklands, East (Mr. Smith) or the hon. Member for Dunfermline, East (Mr. Brown)—that would be inimicable to being part of the United Kingdom.<br><br>
The question should not stand or fall solely on the issue of money. Of course it would be much more expensive for all of us if we were independent. The pamphlets being put out by the Scottish National party contain disgracefully misleading figures. The Scottish people should be worried that those who claim to support them give them such misleading information. The question of money is fundamental to the operation of any Assembly or Parliament. If an Assembly were set up in Edinburgh, the first thing that it would need would be money. We are told by the convention that it would get some assigned revenues—presumably, revenues raised in Scotland that would be returned to Scotland. That is difficult to define, but let us assume that it could be done.<br><br>
The Assembly would also be able to raise additional taxes or to reduce taxes, which would be interesting if it ever happened. The right hon. and learned Member for Monklands, East has suggested that the additional tax could be up to 3p in the pound. That could be done. Our local authorities have been putting up rates and more recently poll tax, irrespective of the extreme distress that that has caused to many people.<br><br>
The fundamental question, however, is the one that the hon. Member for Garscadden was asked: what about the borrowing consent and the Treasury contribution? He said that that would have to be negotiated. Indeed, but on what basis would the negotiations be conducted? That was clearly illustrated by the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond). What we heard this morning is only a tiny fraction of what we would hear all day, every
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0043">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 27</span>
day and all week, every week from the hon. Gentleman if he were a member of the Assembly. Whatever Westminster allocated, it would not be enough. If Westminster were enormously generous and dished out twice as much money as it gives now, it would still not be enough. If that sum looked like being enough, they would build more hospitals and schools, so that it was not enough. I suggest to Labour Front-Bench spokesmen that it is desperately important for them to address that issue. They are not addressing it because they would rather that that did not happen. Yet, it will happen all day, every day if there is devolution.<br><br>
Not long ago, the hon. Member for Garscadden was asked about the Secretary of State's role and his response was extremely weak. Clearly, either he had not thought about the Secretary of State's role, or he thought that it was unimportant. He thought that it would be all right on the night. In fact, the role of successive Secretaries of State in ensuring that Scotland's needs and requirements are recognised by Parliament has been enormously successful. I entirely exclude myself, but many distinguished people have been good at doing that, such as Lord Ross of Marnock and, before him, Tom Johnston, as have my right hon. Friends.<br><br>
The role of the Secretary of State depends on how much weight he has in Cabinet. When he speaks in Cabinet, he carries weight not only on matters affecting the Scottish Office—he must carry weight in that—but on Scotland's views, wishes and needs in matters that are not under the Scottish Office. Secretaries of State for Scotland must have that weight, but they will not have it if they have no Department behind them.<br><br>
If the hon. Member for Garscadden were Secretary of State after a Scottish Assembly was set up, his Office would consist of a small private office and one or two small parts of Departments here and there, but nothing else. However good he was when trying to make Scotland's case in Cabinet, he would be listened to politely and that would be all. That would be an enormous disadvantage to Scotland in many different ways. For instance, although there might be some control over inward investment by European regulations—certainly, that would be needed—the key to inward investment is the Department of Trade and Industry, covering the whole of Britain. When people want to set up companies in Britain, the Department is obliged to direct them to Scotland as well as to other parts of Britain. The Scottish Office and, on some occasions, the Secretary of State have to ensure that that actually happens.<br><br>
If responsibility for inward investment were taken away from the Department of Trade and Industry, as it would be an English-only Department, inward investors would, of course, go like lemmings to Milton Keynes, Telford and Washington newtown, because there would be nobody to persuade them to consider East Kilbride and Glenrothes. Effective British regional policy has taken place under both Conservative and Labour Governments. If Lord Ross of Marnock were here today, he would be nodding his head vigorously because he did much with that policy. There is no doubt that the removal of that policy would be very bad for Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir David Steel <span class='memberconstituency'>(Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: That happened in Northern Ireland when it had its own Ministers and Assembly.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Younger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure what point that proves. Will the right hon. Gentleman explain the point that he is making?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir David Steel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My point is that the policy that the right hon. Gentleman has just described operated in Northern Ireland when it had its own Assembly and its own Minister of Commerce.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Younger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Northern Ireland had its own separate Minister of Commerce under the British Government through the Stormont Government. Incoming industry had to go directly through the Ministry of Commerce in Northern Ireland. That could not happen if a Scottish Assembly had no responsibility for such matters.<br><br>
Defence was mentioned a moment ago. The hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond), who is no longer here, must have absolutely no knowledge that defence jobs and spending are enormous factors in Scotland. I presume that his party has a candidate on Clydeside. It is extraordinary that he can write off the effect of defence spending on the workers of Yarrow, as he has done today. It does not seem to matter to him that not a single frigate would be built at Yarrow, if Scotland were separate. Such matters must be faced.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dick Douglas <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dunfermline, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the right hon. Gentleman recognise that there is pressure in Europe to make defence procurement part of the Community's decision-making process? An independent Scotland within Europe would be at the top table deciding on such matters. No one here has been more persuasive in trying to find work for defence contractors in Scotland than I have. However, that is not the future of this nation. We cannot depend on making frigates—currently an important part of the economy—or, for that matter, on Trident. An independent Scotland has to pursue objectives for all its overall requirements, not simply the extremely important, but narrow, defence issue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Younger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that I allowed that intervention. The hon. Gentleman should think hard before he makes comments that are so enormously misleading to people in Scotland. It is very naughty to say that there would be a chance of major defence orders coming to Scotland if his party were in power in a separate Scotland, because people in Scotland must know the truth before they make their decisions.<br><br>
I end by summing up the argument that we all have to face: if there were a Scottish Assembly on the basis of the Scottish Constitutional Convention, it would be wide open to the sort of speech that the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan made today. Such speeches could be made all day, every day and, as a result, there would be increased instability in the Union. There would also be an inevitable decline, causing the break up of the Union in the long term.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to the right hon. Gentleman because he has argued an eloquent case. He has accepted that there is a stirring for change in Scotland. He rejected the status quo, rightly rejected separatism and attacked our system and said that it needed improvement. He seems to be arguing the federal case. After making an interesting contribution, will he tell us what is his conclusion? What does the right hon. Gentleman believe in—the Royal Bank of Scotland, or what?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Younger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has given a sort of synopsis of the remaining few lines of my speech. If I may,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0044">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 29</span>
I shall deliver them in my own way. We all recognise that there is a need to address this issue, although it has to be said—this is my opinion, but it is born out by almost every poll—that the actual level of interest among ordinary people is fairly low. They talk about 25 other things before they talk about devolution. Therefore, we have to beware of thinking that devolution is the only matter about which Scots are interested—that is not so.<br><br>
Liberal Democrat Members are most unlikely ever to have to implement their policy, but if they have to do so, it is workable—[HON. MEMBERS: "Ah."] It is technically workable. The only snag about their policy is that there is absolutely no sign that people in England are prepared to contemplate little Assemblies all over the place—one for Yorkshire, one for Cornwall, one for London and one for the north-west. That is why the right hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Sir D. Steel) and his team have every reason to say that their scheme is workable. However, it will not be implemented for two reasons: first, they will not be the Government and, secondly, they will never persuade the English to take their formula.<br><br>
Finally, I have tried to spell out in my speech that the alternatives that we are offered are unworkable. It does not follow that because Scotland is now uncertain about its relationship anything is better than nothing. A bad, disruptive scheme, which may be meat and drink to the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan and his Scottish National Party colleagues, is not the best way to proceed. By far the best option is to stay with the Union, which has been proven from experience over almost 300 years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>indicated dissent.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Younger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is all very well for the hon. Gentleman to suggest that he is tired of that. Many people in Scotland—far more than support the Conservative party—believe that the Union is important and should be maintained. Their case must be given a hearing. For almost 300 years the Union has worked. It has given Scotland and Scottish Members of Parliament a very powerful position at Westminster. Scots have played an enormous role in Parliament. Many Scots have played leading roles in British Government and, in that sense, the Union has worked extremely well.<br><br>
The difficulties that are causing people concern stem from the fact that in Scotland there are fewer Members from the Conservative party than there are from the other parties. That is not unique to Scotland; it could be said of many other parts of the United Kingdom at different times. We could look at it another way. If Scotland were allowed independence, the English would practically never have a socialist Government because they do not vote in that way, but there is no desire in England to get rid of the present system and find a permanent solution. They recognise the value of the Union.<br><br>
It is incredibly cavalier to throw out the Union because of a few months of difficulties. It has lasted for almost 300 years and has led to the Scots playing a far greater role in the United Kingdom than their numbers would suggest. It plays an important part in the defence of the United Kingdom. The Scots have made an outstanding contribution to the creation of the British Empire and the commonwealth. We shall regret it if we now throw together a scheme that is unstable and open to disruption
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
every day by people who do not wish it well. I urge Scotland to think hard and not to do anything foolish just for short-term relief.</span></p>
<p>12.13 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing <span class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Martin, for calling me after the right hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) because I suspect that, like myself, the right hon. Gentleman is making his final address to the Scottish Grand Committee. I want to pay tribute to the right hon. Gentleman as he is about to retire. He has played a major role not only in Scottish politics but in United Kingdom politics. It is important that people outside the sphere of parliamentary politics understand that politicians with opposing views can form friendships across the political boundaries. I place on record my appreciation of the right hon. Gentleman's contribution. I have not always agreed with him, and he has not always agreed with me, but he has made a major contribution. The right hon. Gentleman will go down in history as the person who had the courage to tell the right hon. Member for Finchley (Mrs. Thatcher) that she could not win the leadership of the Conservative party on the second ballot, that was the beginning of the end of the previous Prime Minister.<br><br>
I am grateful to the Secretary of State for Scotland for arranging this debate. One of the major achievements of the Scottish Constitutional Convention, of which the right hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Sir D. Steel) and I have the honour to be the co-chairs, is that we are debating this matter. For the past three years we have been told by the Secretary of State for Scotland that the Scottish Constitutional Convention is irrelevant. Every time he mentioned the convention he described it as the "so-called" Scottish Constitutional Convention. If someone had said to me, when the convention was set up, that in three years' time it would be instrumental in bringing about a five-hour debate in the Scottish Grand Committee in Edinburgh, I would have looked at him with some suspicion.<br><br>
The Secretary of State has been forced to listen. At the end of the day—too late in my view—in his death-bed repentance he has brought this subject to the Floor of the Scottish Grand Committee. As the Secretary of State is not present now—I do not criticise him for that because he has been with us since the beginning of the proceedings—I shall put my question to the Under-Secretary of State who is to reply for the Government. When the Prime Minister came to Scotland for his fleeting visit on Saturday, he is on record as saying that Scotland can have independence. If the people of Scotland vote for independence, they can have it. If the people of Scotland vote for the proposals of the Scottish Constitutional Convention can they have that? If not, why not? What is the difference? Would the Under-Secretary like to answer?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to respond to the hon. Gentleman's question. The Prime Minister said on Saturday what I have said many times. Of course, if the people of Scotland elect a substantial majority of Members who are explicitly committed to a single policy which brings to an end the Act of Union, we would have to recognise that. However, people vote Labour and Liberal for all sorts of reasons. Any constitutional change in the United Kingdom would be a matter for the United Kingdom Parliament.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0045">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 31</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I expected that answer. The Under-Secretary has teamed up with the Prime Minister, as distinct from the right hon. Member for Ayr who, to his credit, did not try to associate the Scottish Constitutional Convention proposals with the Scottish National party's proposals for total independence. The Prime Minister, the Secretary of State and the Under-Secretary are trying to force the people of Scotland to make a straight choice between independence and the Union. According to them, there is no middle road. Even if the people of Scotland vote for the proposals of the convention—which I describe as a middle road—we have now been told first by the Prime Minister and then by the Under-Secretary that we will not get them. What kind of threat is that to hold over the people of Scotland?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I do not want to give way because I want to get on with my remarks and not delay the Committee. I may give way to the hon. Gentleman in a few minutes if he contains himself.<br><br>
I want to deal first with two other points that were raised in the debate. First, the Secretary of State referred to the police constable who would pay £440 a year more if the convention were to exercise revenue raising powers. In the first year of the poll tax in Scotland, when it was not yet implimented in England, I did not hear the Secretary of State express great concern about Scottish police constables having to pay the poll tax when their English counterparts did not. There was no cloak of concern then for Scottish police constables. I must say to the Secretary of State in his absence that the cloak of concern for the people of Scotland, especially police constables, that he was wearing this morning simply does not fit him.<br><br>
Secondly, I do not accept that Governments or companies that wanted to build vessels, for civilian or military use, would ignore Scottish yards, provided that their quotes were competitive. Governments and companies would not spite the people of Scotland for deciding to have their own Parliament, under the convention's proposals, by withholding orders from Scottish yards if those yards were offering the best priced. We did not get the order for three type-23 frigates to be built on the Clyde as a favour; it was because we offered the best price. If other United Kingdom yards had offered a lower price, we would not have won the order. That will be true under a Scottish Parliament sitting in Edinburgh. It is nonsense to try to frighten the people of Scotland in that way. That is the politics of fear and it will rebound on Tory Members if they continue on that course.<br><br>
I shall now deal with the speech of the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond). I am an understanding chap and I understand why he spoke for so long and why he so vehemently opposed the Scottish Constitutional Convention's proposals. If those proposals prevail and are accepted by the people of Scotland, the hon. Gentleman's proposals will fail. He is fighting for his political life as we approach the general election. On that subject, one reason why I am grateful for today's debate is that I hope that—and I say this especially to my hon. Friends—we shall not fall into the trap that is being set for us by the Conservative party, which is that the only issue of debate will be the constitution. That would allow the Government to get away with their appalling record on unemployment, health, education, the poll tax and all the things that have
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
been foisted on the people of Scotland against their wishes. The election will be about all those matters; the constitution will be one element.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Banff and Buchan did not draw his usual comparison with the Republic of Ireland and demand a seat at the top table to gain influence. That demand gives the impression that the Republic of Ireland gains advantage from having a seat at the top table. Value added tax is 21 per cent. in the Republic of Ireland and 17·5 per cent. in this country—and too high at that. I admit that there are derated items and items with reduced rates in the Republic, for example, concrete blocks carry only a 12 per cent. VAT rate. Under the SNP, we would need a few concrete blocks in Scotland.<br><br>
Interest rates in the Republic of Ireland are higher than those in this country. Its fishing fleet had no derogation during the tie-up period. The history of the Republic of Ireland's membership of the European Economic Community shows that it has gained no advantages from independent representation in Europe.<br><br>
Where does the madcap idea of Scotland's independence within Europe come from? It is a direct lift from the late Tom Johnston's book, in which he argued for Scotland's independence within the empire. All that is necessary is to substitute "independent within Europe" for "independent within the Empire".<br><br>
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Sillars) wrote the pamphlet "Don't Butcher Scotland's Future", one section of which argued that there was no longer an empire within which to create the changes needed in Scotland and that it was necessary to seek other vehicles. The vehicle of Europe was not available in 1968 because we were not members of the EEC. Now it is available and the hon. Member for Govan gives the impression that the idea was a brilliant flash of light, when he has simply lifted it from Tom Johnston's book about independence within the empire.<br><br>
As we approach the election campaign we have three choices. It is not true that that the Conservatives enter the campaign with a no-change policy. The Government intend to re-organise local government into a one-tier structure and cut by 50 per cent.—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>indicated assent.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) nods in agreement. They intend to cut the number of elected councillors by 50 per cent. and reduce democracy in Scotland still further. That is the Tory's position.<br><br>
I am proud to be a part of the Labour party. I am willing to share the proceeds of oil revenues with my friends in Wales, Northern Ireland and England. I am prepared to argue that case with the people of Scotland. I am not a separatist; I favour the preservation of the Union. To preserve and strengthen the Union, we should adopt the suggestion of the Scottish Constitutional Convention. The other choice for the people of Scotland is total separation. I have argued for 30 years that that would be a disaster, and nothing has happened to change my mind on that.<br><br>
This place has a special meaning to me; I was a Scottish Office Minister when we purchased the building. I have seen it at its worst and I now see it at its best. I was a Minister in the Parliament that approved the money to reconstruct this building. My final word in this building to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0046">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 33</span>
a Scottish Grand Committee is that I hope and believe that the next time parliamentarians meet in here, it will be the beginning of a meaningful Scottish Parliament.</span></p>
<p>[Mr. Norman Hogg <i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
<p>12.28 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir David Steel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a particular pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Ewing) and I agree with the last words that he uttered. He began with a well-deserved tribute to the right hon. Member for Ayr (Sir G. Younger), and it is right for me to add that we shall miss the hon. Member for Falkirk, East who is also retiring at the general election. I thank him not only for his time at the Scottish Office, but especially for his joint chairmanship of the Scottish Constitutional Convention, which I greatly enjoyed sharing with him.<br><br>
This is a long debate but we have all been enjoined to be as brief as possible. I shall try to obey that injunction. Let us consider what happened at the referendum in 1979. Various references have been made to what Alec Douglas-Home did or did not say. I have his actual words here. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I should hesitate to vote no if I did not think that the parties will keep the devolution issue at the top of their priorities"—</p></blockquote>
not just on the agenda or here and there in Grand Committee debates, but at the top of their priorities. I ask the Secretary of State, where is the priority that was promised in 1979 if the referendum on devolution voted no? The Conservative party in Opposition made promises that it did not keep in Government. That is one reason why it has gone steadily downhill during its time in Government.<br><br>
I shall quote the right hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind). I have done so many times at greater length, but this is one sentence of what he said when he resigned from the shadow Cabinet in protest at the refusal of the right hon. Member for Finchley (Mrs. Thatcher) to countenance an advance on the Scottish Assembly. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Scotland is the only territory on the face of the earth which has a legal system without a legislature to improve, modernise and amend it."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 16 December 1976; Vol. 922, c. 1832–3.]</p></blockquote>
That was not just his personal opinion; it was a statement of fact that is as true today, while he is a member of the Cabinet, as it was when he sat on the Opposition Benches and resigned from the shadow Cabinet.<br><br>
There have been other changes since the referendum in 1979. The most obvious change, graphically illustrated by this meeting of the Scottish Grand Committee today, and one of the reasons why I always welcome meetings in Edinburgh is that people who attend our debates or watch them on television can see the balance of the elected representatives of the people of Scotland. The greatest change since the referendum of 1979 is that we have in theory been governed by the rump that has sat on the other side for the past 13 years.<br><br>
The Secretary of State talks negatively all the time about the convention's proposals. I challenge him to produce one anomaly in those proposals as great as the anomaly that we have suffered during the past 13 years, when that minority has railroaded legislation through the House of Commons by using the English and Welsh majority and foisted on Scotland legislation for which our
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 34</span>
people never voted. We have had experiments in education and health, for which we never voted. We had the poll tax inflicted on us a year earlier than England and Wales, but we were not relieved of it a year earlier. Whatever criticisms may be made of the convention's proposals, they are not open to the fundamental criticism that can be made of how we have been governed for the past 13 years.<br><br>
Another change since the referendum is that we have lost a departmental Select Committee. I remind the Scottish Grand Committee today that the Select Committee on Procedure last Sesssion report that
<br><blockquote><p>"The inability of the House to agree upon the membership of a Select Committee which its own standing orders state 'shall be appointed' is regrettable. Moreover, the absence of a Scottish Affairs Committee leaves a major Government Department unscrutinised and thus constitutes a deficiency (some would consider a serious deficiency) in the departmentally-related Committee system."</p></blockquote>
Over the past few years, every Department of State has been scrutinised by the elected representatives of the people, except one—the Scottish Office. That cannot be allowed to continue. It is not enough for the Government to speak here and in other debates against the proposals, yet to offer nothing in return—no counter-proposals of any kind.<br><br>
There is another change—not so much a change as a trend—that has continued since the referendum in 1979 and that is continued administrative devolution to the Scottish Office without parliamentary control. The latest example has just been enacted—the transfer of control of Scottish universities to the Scottish Office. I wholly welcome that, but it adds to the congestion and lack of parliamentary accountability to those of us who are elected to represent the people of Scotland.<br><br>
When we go to the House of Commons we can see our English colleagues raising questions day after day—one day questions on agriculture, the next day questions to the Home Secretary on law and order, the next questions to the housing Minister, the next questions to the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry on tourism, and so on with questions on education, health and road transport on different days to different Ministers. Meanwhile we, the elected representatives of the Scottish people, if we are lucky in the raffle, save up our one question, for the one day in the month when we can question the Secretary of State for Scotland on all those matters. That system of government is no longer acceptable to the people of Scotland, nor to their elected representatives. It is not enough for the Government to sit silently, shooting down every scheme put forward and offering nothing in place of the present system.<br><br>
Last night, I came across from Canada. I had the opportunity to see there a devolved system of government. While there, I read the reports of the Prime Minister's speech in Glasgow yesterday. I gather that he said that he loved the Union. So do I, but I love a Union that is capable of improvement and reform. The Prime Minister, listening to the Secretary of State for Scotland as he does, is wrong to believe that the way to preserve the Union is to resist reform. The reverse is true: the more often the Government say that we can choose only between the status quo or total independence, the more the polls show a move towards total independence. The status quo is not an option. It will not be accepted by the elected representatives of the people or by the people themselves. That is why the Government are under an obligation to look at the possibilities of reform.<br><br>

Each time that we quote leaders from <i>The Scotsman</i> or the <i>Herald,</i> the Government shrug their shoulders collectively and say, "They are at it again". This morning, the first leader in <i>The Times,</i> The Thunderer itself was entitled "Scotland rebuffed". It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"If Mr. Major is right that no stable balance between central and regional power is possible, and any attempt to find one will precipitate total fragmentation, then he should have gone to Maastricht under a flag of surrender.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Of course the theory is nonsense. Scotland is as natural a candidate for a generous dose of subsidiarity as anywhere in the world."</p></blockquote>
If that is the Thunderer's view, surely the Conservative party could think again about its position. It is driving people away from a sensible set of proposals advanced by the majority of the people's representatives in the constitutional convention. It has retreated from the title that it once sailed under, of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist party, and is arguing for the break up of the Union by offering only the alternative of the status quo.<br><br>
Since the convention concluded its proceedings, one of the Government's ploys has been to attack it, not for what is in its document, but for what is not in it. They say, "What about the number of Members of Parliament at Westminster?" or, "What about the position of the Secretary of State?" I say bluntly that those are not matters for the constitutional convention. They are not even matters for the Scottish Grand Committee; they are matters for Westminster to decide. The consequences on the Parliament at Westminster of having a Parliament in Scotland must be for Westminster to determine.<br><br>
I am amazed that the right hon. Member for Ayr will not countenance any reduction in the number of Scottish Members of Parliament. I remind him that, before 1979, the Royal Commission on the constitution recommended just that. I would have no hesitation in being a candidate in the first elections for a Scottish Parliament, but I would have no objection to a reduction in the number of Scottish Members to compensate for the fact that Scotland has its own representatives. That is my personal opinion, but it has nothing to do with what is proposed by the convention.<br><br>
I listened with interest to what the right hon. Gentleman said about the role of the Secretary of State for Scotland. I doubt if the people of Scotland will be crying in the streets if that post is abolished. Although the Secretary of State was originally seen to be Scotland's man in Government, he is increasingly seen as the Government's man in Scotland—certainly under the present Administration.<br><br>
Not only Canada has evolved a system of what it calls asymetric federalism; it occurs also in Spain, where the Parliament of Catalonia has powers greater than some of Spain's other provinces. I am not afraid to have asymetric federalism under a Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh. If the English and Welsh choose to follow suit, so be it. I would welcome it.<br><br>
I thank the right hon. Member for Ayr for his gracious tribute, acknowledging that our proposals are at least logical, consistent and whatever else he said that I can put in my election address. I entirely agree with him. However, a lot of fluff and thunder has grown up over what was said by the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) on television the other day. What he said was common sense. He was talking not about a constitutional bar, but about his personal preference that if a Scottish Parliament came into being, he would think it wrong for him to administer
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 36</span>
the health of the people of England and Wales. That is a sensible position to adopt. It shows that we Scots are quite capable of adapting pragmatically to the consequences of the constitutional changes that would come about.<br><br>
It is difficult for me to understand on what logic the Government deny the Scottish people the right—I emphasise, the right—to determine their own future. The Under-Secretary denied that right. He said that if we chose independence we could have it, but if the people expressed a preference for a Scottish Parliament within the United Kingdom, for some reason that I do not understand, that would not be possible. The Government are being inconsistent. They have after all extended that right to the people of Northern Ireland not only in previous border polls but most recently in this Parliament. Article 10 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement refers to
<br><blockquote><p>"achieving devolution on a basis which secures widespread acceptance in Northern Ireland".</p></blockquote>
What about widespread acceptance in Scotland? Why are we not to be treated in the same way?<br><br>
Moreover, in 1982 the right hon. Member for Finchley enunciated a policy which was of doubtful constitutional validity when she declared that the wishes of the Falkland islanders were "paramount". It was not that their interests had to be safeguarded, nor that they had to be consulted, but that the wishes of those 2,000 people would be "paramount" in any discussion with the Argentine. Since the end of the Falklands war that doctrine has led to expenditure of over £3,000 million on various aspects of the "Fortress Falklands" policy—far in excess of the wildest estimates of the cost of establishing self-determination for five million Scots.<br><br>
Yet the constitutional claim of the right of the Scots to demand the renegotiation of the terms and mechanisms of the 1707 Act of Union is undeniable. Even the English constitutional theorist Professor Dicey conceded that while legislative sovereignty was vested in Parliament, political sovereignty lay with the people.<br><br>
The Lord President of the Court of Session, the late Lord Cooper, in his celebrated 1953 judgment was quite specific about that when he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The principle of the unlimited sovereignty of Parliament is a distinctively English principle which has no counterpart in Scottish constitutional law."</p></blockquote>
His judgment is particularly relevant to the work of the convention and its conclusions when he went on to argue:
<br><blockquote><p>"To put the matter in another way, it is of little avail to ask whether the Parliament of Great Britain 'can' do this thing or that, without going on to inquire who can stop them if they do."</p></blockquote>
The answer, I believe, is that as neither judicial review nor federal constitution were known in 1707, the will of the Scottish people as expressed through their elected representatives ought to be able to stop Parliament. As 58, now 59, of the 72 elected Scottish Members of Parliament met in the convention together with—let this not be forgotten as it tends to be portrayed by the Government as simply a cobbling together of the Labour party and the Liberal Democrats—representatives of 59 of Scotland's elected local authorities, the various Churches and trade unions, and agreed on what the Claim of Right described as
<br><blockquote><p>"a scheme for a Scottish Assembly",</p></blockquote>
the Westminster Parliament dare not ignore our demands.<br><br>
I must tell the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond) that I do not understand why the Scottish National party does not join with us in this plea for unity.

If we are wrong and if the Scottish Parliament within the Union does not work, his party would still have the right to claim and press for total independence. The SNP can argue that in elections and within the Scottish Parliament. But the reverse is not true. If once we get independence and we find that it is a busted flush, there is no going back. We have had it then. That is why there is a great gulf between the percentage of people who register support for independence and the percentage willing to vote for the SNP. Most people in Scotland want to give the Scottish Parliament within the Union a try. That is what the great majority of people would like to see and what they will demand after the election.<br><br>
The convention succeeded in putting right three widely acknowledged defects in the 1979 devolution proposals. First, the convention's proposal involves no extra tier of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 38</span>
Government, as we are all agreed that local government should be reduced to a single tier. Second, it introduces a high degree of financial and taxation autonomy. Third, it rejects the Westminster electoral system for Scotland.<br><br>
The Claim of Right published in 1988 was the most level-headed and persuasively argued declaration to be produced for many years. I come from a party that was promoting the Scottish Home Rule Association last century and that secured the passage of a Scottish home rule bill through the Commons just before the outbreak of the first world war. I doubt whether our arguments could have been put more succinctly than in the Claim of Right which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Scotland has the right to insist on articulating its own demands and grievances, rather than have them articulated for it by a Government utterly unrepresentative of Scots".</p></blockquote></span></p>
