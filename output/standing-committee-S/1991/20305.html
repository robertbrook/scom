The Constitutional Implications for Scotland of a Scottish Parliament</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before we start the debate, I wish to point out that at our previous sitting in Edinburgh, three hon. Members sat for five hours and were disappointed not to be called to speak. I am determined that they will be called to speak this morning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee has considered the matter of the constitutional implications for Scotland of a Scottish Parliament.</p></blockquote>
Perhaps you could add my name to the list of the three hon. Members who sat for five hours and were disappointed, Mr. Martin. I sat for five hours and was very disappointed that Opposition Members did not answer the questions of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State.<br><br>
I welcome the opportunity to discuss the constitutional implications for Scotland of a Scottish Parliament because it enables us to examine the new Lib-Lab pact and the scheme for constitutional change outlined in the report of the Scottish Constitutional Convention. The scheme is ill-considered, dangerous, inconsistent and immature.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brian Wilson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cunninghame, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Take it to court.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alistair Darling <span class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Write to the Lord Advocate about it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not surprised that hon. Gentlemen do not wish to listen to the argument on this issue. I note that the turnout of Opposition Members is overwhelming. However, as a proportion, we may be doing rather better than them. Opposition Members should treat the subject seriously. We are discussing the constitution, which is the core of our country. It should not be tampered with. Their proposals would fracture 300 years of constitutional stability.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Rubbish.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall quote to the hon. Gentleman what the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) said when he spoke on a BBC television programme a few weeks ago. <i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson) is supposed to be a Front-Bench spokesman, yet he makes fun of one of his most distinguished Back Benchers. The hon. Member for Linlithgow said:
<br><blockquote><p>"what is now at issue is the question of the Union and people are rapidly, and ever more quickly, going to have to make up their minds whether they want a separate State or Union with England."</p></blockquote>
I agree with the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. The assertion that the Minister made about me is utterly false.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I believe in the Union. Scotland, as part of the United Kingdom, has a voice at the top table. It has been a key player in organisations such as the Group of Seven, the European Community, NATO, and the United Nations. Our history, culture and heritage are products of the most successful partnership in history—the marriage that began with the Act of Union. That Union created the age of enlightenment and the industrial revolution. It brought us the empire and the Commonwealth. Our language has been spread around the globe. As part of that Union, we have stood strong against tyranny in Europe and we have created democracy with freedom under the law.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Maxton <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Exactly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Exactly. We have worked as partners. In the words of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Sillars), "We have lived, died and worked together." That Union is now being threatened by the Labour party and the Liberal Democratic party as well as the Scottish National party. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) is not in Committee today, but he has contributed—<i>[Interruption.]</i> I am not criticising the hon. Gentleman for not being here; I am making it clear that I am referring to him in his absence. The hon. Member for Garscadden and his hon. Friends have embraced the rhetoric of nationalism. They have opposed the Government for two, if not three, Parliaments by attacking the Westminster system of government and the Union itself.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>indicated dissent.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman shakes his head. Was it not his hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden who talked about independence within the United Kingdom? Was it not Opposition Members who denounced school boards as anglicisation? In speech after speech, Opposition Members have said that the Government have no mandate to govern in Scotland. [HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] They say, "Hear, hear" and talk about the Government of the United Kingdom having no mandate to govern in part of the United Kingdom. That is the language of nationalists.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes <span class='memberconstituency'>(Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister not realise that it is not us but the Government who are threatening the Union by suggesting an artificial polarisation of either separation on the one hand or the status quo on the other? By propounding those two extreme positions, the Government are threatening the Union. Our scheme will preserve it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says, "It is not us". I take it that he refers to himself and his colleagues. At the previous sitting of the Committee, the hon. Member for Falkirk, West (Mr. Canavan) said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I have never argued that independence should not be considered as an option. If the Government ever offered me a choice between the status quo or independence, I would opt for independence."</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galloway) said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I am the third person to say"—</p></blockquote>
the other two being Labour colleagues—
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0007">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 3</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"that if confronted with the choice between the status quo and independence, I would opt for independence."—<i>[Official Report, Scottish Grand Committee,</i> 24 February 1992; c. 44, 65.]</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes) cannot deny that his colleagues have been guilty of using the language of nationalism.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir David Steel <span class='memberconstituency'>(Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me continue for a moment.<br><br>
The truth is that the devolution policy of the Labour party is designed more to maintain a united Labour party than a United Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir David Steel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely the Minister realises the folly of presenting that totally false choice. Hon. Gentlemen were merely reflecting what opinion polls show. The Government's mistake is to pretend that there is nothing but the status quo or total separation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman has an acceptable solution and I give him credit for that: he supports a federal constitution and that idea is workable. His colleagues in the constitutional convention do not.<br><br>
The fundamental test of a Unionist is whether he or she accepts that each part of the United Kingdom is prepared to submit its will for the good of the whole of the United Kingdom and that the Union is dependent on the supremacy of the Westminster Parliament. The irony is that Opposition Members who challenge the sovereignty of this Parliament, which has stood for nearly 300 years, would have signed anything that was put before them at Maastricht and given power to an unelected bureaucracy.<br><br>
What is the reason for that apparent paradox? Why are Opposition Members so prepared to see power passed to an unelected bureaucracy in Brussels and so determined to prevent Parliament from continuing to operate as a sovereign Parliament in the United Kingdom. The motive is clear: it is to advance socialism. Many Members of the Scottish Labour party, including the hon. Members for Falkirk, West and for Hillhead, no longer believe that Labour can win under the Westminster system. As my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister pointed out in his excellent speech in Glasgow the other day, the Labour party has ridden the nationalist tiger and is now in danger of being eaten.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Phrase makers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is concerned about phrase makers. I was struck by the phrase maker for the <i>Daily Record</i> who said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Mr. Major said those who want a Scottish Parliament are `riding a tiger'. He got his animals mixed up.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Scotland's beast is a lion—and it has never been more rampant."</p></blockquote>
I venture to suggest that if the Scots are lions, those who put their trust in the proposals of the Labour party are lions led by donkeys.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister explain why our proposals are wrong when they have been followed so successfully by France, Germany and Spain, all of which have decentralised power to varying degrees and all of which perform substantially better than our over-centralised, over-governed country? Will the Minister explain why decentralisation should work in continental
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
Europe, but could not work here? Our solution would decentralise power and invigorate the whole of the United Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can hardly believe that the hon. Gentleman asked that question. Germany has a federal constitution. The right hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Sir D. Steel) proposes a federal constitution. The Labour party proposes a unitary system within which is another Parliament, that is unworkable.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Darling) brings us to the basic fraud being perpetrated on the Scottish people. The Opposition pretend that there is agreement within the Scottish Constitutional Convention. They pretend that there is an agreed scheme. For two years, we have listened to convention's debate, but still there is no agreement. There is no agreement about the number of Members of Parliament at Westminster. Liberal Democrat Members say that the number of Members of Parliament should be reduced; Labour Members say that they should not. There is no agreement about the role of the Secretary of State. Liberal Democrat Members say that there should be no Secretary of State; Labour Members say that perhaps there should be a Secretary of State, but they are not entirely sure what he would do. There is no agreement—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is the same speech as that on a week past Monday.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that this is the same speech, but we are still waiting for the answers. He says that these matters are of no importance. The role of Scottish Members of Parliament in this Parliament is important. Liberal Democrat Members say that Scottish Members of Parliament should not be able to vote on matters relating to England and Wales; Labour Members say that they should because they know that there would never be a Labour Government at Westminster without that absurdity coming about.<br><br>
Labour Members say that there should be a statutory requirement that half of the Members of a Scottish Parliament should be women; Liberal Democrat Members say that that is nonsense—that there should be more women Members but that there should not be a statutory requirement. On the voting system—here we have a re-run of the Lib-Lab pact—Liberal Democrat Members say that there should be proportional representation; Labour Members say that they are not sure what system should be used, but that it will be an additional member system and they still have to work out to what extent it will be proportional. The two parties are divided on fundamental questions which remain unanswered.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In a moment.<br><br>
Despite all of that, the most extraordinary interview was given by the Leader of the Opposition to the ubiquitous Mr. Kenny Macintyre on Radio Scotland. The right hon. Gentleman said, "Oh, we will be introducing the Bill straightaway. There will be no need to delay it. We've got the draft Bill. The ideas have been worked out. We know exactly the powers that will be exercised." If Labour has drafted a Bill, the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) can answer our questions. What will be the role of Scottish Members of this Parliament? Will they be able to vote at Westminster? What system of election will
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0008">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
operate? Those are the questions that we want answered. The Leader of the Opposition says, "We have got the draft Bill". The hon. Member for Cathcart should publish it and let us see what it says.<br><br>
The truth is that there is no draft Bill. [HON. MEMBERS: "Yes, there is."] If the hon. Gentleman has the draft Bill, he can publish it, so that we can see the answers. I suspect that his friends in the convention may be somewhat— <i>[Interruption.]</i> I am prepared to believe that they may have the answers. Perhaps the answers were going to be unveiled at a press conference the other day, chaired by my distinguished constituent, Mr. Robbie Coltrane. I do not know why Mr. Coltrane should have chaired the press conference, except that if one is going to deliver a joke, it is a good idea to get a comedian to do it, for one. However, it is a good idea to get a comedian who remembers the right punch line, because the punch line was rather more appropriate for the nationalists than for the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Sillars). That, again, is evidence of tensions within the Labour party between those who support nationalism and those who support the Westminster system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jim Sillars <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Govan)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does not the Minister think that the reason why Robbie Coltrane said that he preferred independence was because he, unlike the members of the Committee, had seen the draft Bill?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes my point more eloquently and more succinctly than I did.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is becoming very noisy. There are an awful lot of excited Members here.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. Martin. My speeches seem to have that effect. I suspect that the Bill is not entirely worked out.<br><br>
I shall quote the words of the Leader of the Opposition on 13 January 1976—[HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."] I am sorry that Opposition Members find their leader's words so disappointing. The right hon. Gentleman said:
<br><blockquote><p>"With a Welsh Assembly looking after health and housing in my constituency, hon. Members may ask what right I have to vote on these matters as the affect English constituencies." —[<i>Official Report,</i> 13 January 1976; Vol. 903, c. 295.]</p></blockquote>
Indeed, hon. Members may ask and we should like some answers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Out of the five Conservative Members in Committee, the Minister is the only one who did not stand in the 1974 general election under a Conservative manifesto that promised a Scottish Assembly if the Conservatives won the election. I am sorry—three out of the five Conservative Members in Committee stood at that election.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker <span class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not stand on such a manifesto.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman, indeed, stood in the election under that manifesto. If one group of people can change their mind, so can others.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not questioning the Leader of the Opposition's ability to change his mind. That is manifest on a range of policy. I am putting the same question as that put by the Leader of the Opposition in the House. Presumably, if he has changed his mind, it is because he has found the answer to the question. I simply ask: what is the answer to the question?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, North-East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make some progress. I shall give way to the hon. and learned Gentleman later.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In a moment.<br><br>
I ask Members to consider the words that the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) used in the House on 14 November 1977. [HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."] Hon. Gentlemen should listen to the arguments. Hon. Members may remember that the hon. Member for Livingston opined on the matter a few days ago. In 1977, he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"After devolution, the position of Scottish hon. Members will be untenable. I shall be able to vote on matters concerning English education, for example, but English Members will not be able to vote on Scottish education. What would I say to a constituent who came to me and asked me to discuss education? I should have to tell him that if he wished to discuss Scottish education he must find a member of the Scottish Assembly, but that if he wished to discuss English education I could hear him as I still had some influence and even responsibility for that."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 14 November 1977; Vol. 939, c. 157.]</p></blockquote>
The hon. Gentleman made our argument for us. There is no response to the questions that we have put.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for managing finally to give way. He should read the convention documents more carefully. If he did, he would discover that, although Liberal Democrat and Labour Members have not agreed on the precise system for ensuring equality in a Scottish Parliament, they have agreed for a long time on the principle that there should be equal numbers. That is much further than the Minister, or his Government, is ever likely to step.<br><br>
When the likes of the Minister refer persistently in their speeches to hon. Gentlemen as though there were no women present, and when they delay letting a woman Member intervene, that is the sort of thing that angers women in Scotland and makes them all the more determined that there will be equal representation in the Scottish Parliament. It is a struggle for any woman in this place to have a say for the women of Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that I gave way to the hon. Lady because she still has not told me what is in the Bill. If she admits, as she did, that there is no agreement yet between the two parties, how can the Leader of the Opposition have produced a Bill? Or is he producing a Bill that ignores the convention?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I will not give way. The question put by the hon. Member for Linlithgow—the west Lothian question—remains unanswered. It is not a new question. It was asked in 1886 by Joseph Chamberlain of the Home Rule Bill that Gladstone was going to introduce at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Look what happened in Ireland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point is that Ireland was part of the Westminster system and that Gladstone wanted to introduce a devolutionary measure. The question asked by Joseph Chamberlain was what administrative arrangements there would be for the representation of Irish Members in the House, and how they would express their views. The question was unanswered, and how did the

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
matter end? The hon. Gentleman is right—it ended with separation and independence for Ireland. The hon. Gentleman helpfully makes my point for me.<br><br>
The truth is that we cannot have two classes of Member of Parliament in this House. We cannot have Members who can vote on some issues but not on others. In Scotland we have devolved administration. If a legislative body were added to that, it would create autonomy and, with autonomy, separation. The notion put forward by Labour Members, that raiding parties of Members of Parliament from Scotland would come to overturn the will of the people in England while impotent in their own constituencies, is absurd. It is fundamental to the Union that all Members of Parliament in this House have equal rights and equal standing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The parallel that the Minister seeks to draw with Ireland would not sustain rigorous intellectual analysis. <i>[Interruption.]</i> If the Home Rule Bill had been introduced in the terms in which it was introduced into the House of Commons, the problems of Ireland might not have been as they are today.<br><br>
Let me remind the Minister of a piece of history that is closer to home. He mentioned 1976. In 1976 the right hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind) told the House of Commons, prior to his resignation from the Front Bench of the then Conservative Opposition, that Scotland needed a Parliament not least because it was the only country with its own domestic system of law which did not have its own domestic legislature. I understand that that is still the right hon. and learned Gentleman's position. How could the Minister serve under him as Under-Secretary of State for Scotland if they disagreed so fundamentally about the way in which Scotland should be governed?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman is being uncharacteristically ungenerous. My right hon. and learned Friend has always made it clear that any system of devolution would have to be in a federal context. [HON. MEMBERS: "No, he has not."] Oh yes, he has. He is on record as saying that and has made many speeches recently in which he has made his position clear.<br><br>
Let me turn to the question of finance and funding. On those matters also, questions remain unanswered. One thing is certain: a Scottish Parliament would increase expenditure and the extra expenditure which we enjoy would be put at risk. [HON. MEMBERS: "Why?"] Of course, it would be. That is obvious. The hon. Member for Livingston told the House on 14 November 1977:
<br><blockquote><p>"We have to be honest about this. This Assembly will inevitably expand public expenditure. There can be no doubt about that. Any new democratic body will find new ways of spending public money."</p></blockquote>
I agree with the hon. Gentleman. He went on to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"We have been very fortunate in Scotland in that we have about a 20 per cent. to 30 per cent. higher public expenditure than the rest of Great Britain. We have got away with that because Parliament was never asked what should be the right level of public expenditure in Scotland."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 14 November 1977; Vol. 939 c. 159].</p></blockquote>
Those are not my words. They are true and hon. Members know it. I agree with the hon. Gentleman and so do 58 per cent of Scots who said in a Harris poll last month that they were not prepared to pay extra for a Scottish Parliament.<br><br>
The right hon. and learned Member for Monklands, East (Mr. Smith) has come to the rescue of the Opposition
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
and the taxpayer in Scotland. It is true that under Labour proposals the Scots would be the most highly taxed people in the United Kingdom, but the right hon. and learned Gentleman said that he would introduce Assembly tax capping: there would be a 3p in the pound limit on the tax that the assembly could levy. He said that he would release local authorities from capping. They would be able to raise the business rate to any level, but the Assembly would be capped at 3p.<br><br>
Opposition Members have made speeches about the gearing of the poll tax and the difficulties that have arisen because the revenue raised locally has been about 10 per cent. of the revenue spent by local authorities, which has created a gearing effect. What gearing will the Scottish Parliament have? A mere 2·5 per cent. of the revenue will be raised in Scotland and 97·5 per cent. will be decided at Westminster. What kind of body will it be if it has all the apparatus and panoply of a Parliament, but relies for 97·5 per cent. of its expenditure on this House and on those who have power here?<br><br>
The truth is that the Labour party is offering Scotland a system that would result in fewer Members of Parliament and no Secretary of State in the Cabinet. There is even the possibility that a Scottish Assembly would have to negotiate with a Government of a different party at Westminster on Scottish health, education and housing. We are told that that would be a step forward. Labour Members should answer some questions. What would happen if a Scottish Parliament were funded from a proportion of tax revenues collected, and at Westminster the Government were committed to tax cuts and public expenditure cuts? Hon. Gentlemen shake their heads. What would happen under the convention scheme is that the amount of money allocated to the Assembly would go down. What would happen if the Assembly were elected on a platform of increasing public expenditure? The proposal is unworkable.<br><br>
I promise that I shall quote the Leader of the Opposition for the last time. On 10 January 1978 he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"One is tempted to say 'Let the Scots have their heads; let us continue this devolution exercise; let us consider this monstrous constitutional step as no more than an experiment in advancing democracy'. In that frame of mind we could treat the people of Scotland as guinea pigs who must learn by their own mistakes, and who can return to a sane system of financing their needs when it is all over."</p></blockquote>
To his credit, he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Of course, we cannot really give in to such a temptation, firstly, because of the interests for which we have responsibility for the whole of the United Kingdom, and, secondly, and more parochially, because of the way in which devolution has tumbled, staggered, crept and crawled forward, with Wales being dragged along on tartan coat-tails."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 10 January 1978; Vol. 941, c. 1537–8.]</p></blockquote>
The Leader of the Opposition understood the arguments all those years ago. What has changed? What has changed is that Opposition Members are now offering a recipe for conflict and division. Local government would have to go cap in hand to an Assembly that has no control over the majority of its revenue. The amount of Government support as part of local authority expenditure is 60 per cent. higher in Scotland than in England, and 40 per cent. of local authority debt is in respect of Scottish local authorities.<br><br>
What about Europe? Who would speak for Scotland in Europe? The convention offers an office in Brussels and a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0010">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
man to attend the delegation, but who would speak in Europe? It would be the voice of Westminster; the voice of Scotland would be marginalised.<br><br>
Perhaps the hon. Member for Cathcart will answer the question put by the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond), who is not present either. What would happen at a meeting of the Council of Ministers if the Scottish Parliament wanted the social charter and the Westminster Parliament did not? Westminster's view would prevail.<br><br>
All that the convention scheme would achieve would be the creation of a vast bureaucracy with extra civil servants and costs. The money would be better spent on extra home helps and nursery teachers. [HON. MEMBERS: "What a cheek."] Hon. Members will be aware of the extent to which both of those groups have expanded under the Government.<br><br>
The Government stand to improve the machinery of Government, not to extend it. We believe in the diffusion of power, not confusion of power. We believe in giving power to people through NHS trusts, school boards and tenant housing co-operatives. We believe that devolution would be a one-way ticket to independence. We believe in unity that permits and encourages diversity—power to people, not to politicians.<br><br>
The Government and the Conservative party stand four square behind the Union. We will fight to defend it and in the weeks ahead we will put the case for maintaining the Union before the people—a Union within which Scotland's voice is strong and a Union that will never be cast aside lightly, as Opposition Members have done for party political advantage.</span></p>
<p>11 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When the Secretary suddenly woke up to the fact that the constitution was a political issue in Scotland, the Labour party welcomed the opportunity for a full debate on the issues involved. It is, therefore a pity that the Government have taken so long to stage it.<br><br>
We had to negotiate long and hard to get the double sitting in Edinburgh last week. Then we had to wait and wait to find out when this debate would take place. The Minister was keen to pull in the issue of Europe into this debate. That is because the Government have offered 17 or 19 March for the fourth debate of the series, which means either that the election will not be held on 9 April or that the debate on Scotland in Europe will not take place. It is obvious that the Government, having had their fingers burnt last week on the subject of the constitution, do not want any more debates on it. It is several months since the Secretary of State so arrogantly suggested the debates. There is no reason why it should have taken so long to hold them or why the last one is being so cavalierly abandoned.<br><br>
I have never heard such a narrow-minded, nit-picking, arrogant, anti-democratic speech from the Minister as the one that he gave this morning—and I am used to hearing such speeches from him. He is basically saying that the Scottish people have no right to decide their future: they cannot decide whether they want higher taxes or what powers they will have because the Minister knows best. He and the Government have shown no vision. They have put forward no new ideas. They have made no attempt to say what changes the Tories will bring about if they should, by some very unlucky mischance, win the next election. There
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
is just an arid clinging to the past by God, the Minister had to go all the way back to the 1970s for his material. It is conservatism at its very worst.<br><br>
It is not just Scottish Office Ministers who have no vision and nothing to offer the Scottish people. In an interview in the <i>Glasgow Herald</i> this week, the Prime Minister brought to bear all his great experience of Scottish affairs and plaintively said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Let us try to see how the grievances have arisen. Let us see what we can do about it."</p></blockquote>
The Labour party has been telling the Government, for 13 years, what the grievances are and what to do about it. What a pity John has not been listening.<br><br>
At the core of the Government's case lies the argument that the establishment of a democratically elected Parliament, within the framework of the United Kingdom, puts the Union between Scotland and the other countries in that Union at risk.<br><br>
Why do Tories believe that while other countries can have decentralised administrations and legislatures, we are incapable of setting up such structures in this country. I accept that it is a federal country, but Germany gives very wide powers to its Läander. Even that most centralised of countries, France, has devolved power to its regions— without having a federal system—and like other countries in the EEC has found that economic success resulted. Above all, Spain has shown that without setting up a full federal structure, power can be given to nations and regions within a country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman saying that Labour Members will stand for election to the United Kingdom Parliament in the forthcoming election on the basis that they, like the Liberal Democrats, propose to introduce a federal structure? If the hon. Gentleman is not saying that, he should not be using the federal structure in Germany to support his case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I always make the mistake of giving way to the hon. Gentleman. If he listens to the next part of my speech, he will hear my arguments against federalism.<br><br>
Above all, Spain has shown that, without setting up a full federal structure, power can be given to the nations and regions within a country. In Spain, different regions have opted for different levels of powers. Thus, the Catalonians and the Basques have sought wide-ranging control over their own affairs while other autonomous communities have chosen to exercise fewer powers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way on the subject of Spain?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.<br><br>
Members of Parliament are elected to the Cortes from all communities, regardless of the amount of power exercised by those communities. All Members in the central Parliament have equal voting rights on all matters. There is no question of excluding Catalan Members from voting on certain matters because their area has a strong autonomous Government. When the Cortes passes a law relating to the police, Catalonia and the Basque country are excluded from that particular law, but their Members of Parliament can still vote on that legislation. There is no demand that Catalonia or the Basque country send fewer Members to the Cortes than they would otherwise do simply because they have strong regional government.<br><br>
Unlike the Tories, the Scottish National party has studied the Spanish experience. That is one reason why it now so vehemently opposes a democratic Scottish
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0011">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
Parliament within the framework of the United Kingdom It has seen that as Spain has given its nations and regions more autonomy, so has the demand for total separation in Catalonia and the Basque country declined. As my hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) said at the last sitting of this Committee, the Scottish National party is opposed to devolution because it knows that that will not lead to the total separation of Scotland from the rest of the United Kingdom. If the Scottish National party can work out that simple fact, why cannot the Tories?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths <span class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Economics was never their strong point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right: we know full well that the Government cannot do economics. I must tell the Minister that Spain answers many of his questions.<br><br>
The Minister has basically argued that, if a Scottish Parliament is set up, anomalies will arise. The British Constitution is already riddled with anomalies. If we had a logical, written constitution, would we allow our laws to be made in part by a House of Lords that is elected by no one and for which the only qualification of the vast majority is that they were born into the right families?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I intervene just on Spain. The Spaniards have 17 different Parliaments—17 separate legislatures with executive and legislative responsibility. Does the hon. Gentleman suggest that there should be a legislative Parliament for every region of the United Kingdom? That is not his party's policy. Yet, that is what they have in Spain and it is near the federal constitution that some hon. Gentleman want.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister knows very little about Spain if he believes that it has a federal constitution; it certainly does not. He is right that there are different Parliaments, but they have very different powers; that is the system there.<br><br>
The British constitution is already riddled with anomalies. One reason why it has survived for so long is that it can adapt to those anomalies; that is its strength. The British constitution is at risk when it no longer responds to the legislative demands and the legitimate demands for change.<br><br>
The greatest constitutional anomaly of all is the Scottish status quo: the situation that allows legislation to be imposed on Scotland, which has been overwhelmingly rejected by the Scottish people. That anomaly is no longer tenable. The Minister spent much time on the so-called west Lothian question, but he spent no time on the Westminster question. Over the past 100 years power has been devolved from Westminster and Whitehall to Scotland. We have a Secretary of State and Ministers. We have 7,000 civil servants working in Scotland. We have separate legislation for Scotland in this place. Nearly all our domestic affairs in Scotland are run by the Scottish Office. Yet, we do not have democratic control over that Scottish Office or over those matters that have been devolved to Scotland.<br><br>
Whatever the Government in power in Westminster, such a situation is wrong, but it has been brutally highlighted over the past 13 years when—without a majority of seats in Scotland, without the consent of the Scottish people and, indeed, against the clearly expressed
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
view of the Scottish people—this Government have ruthlessly imposed their will upon Scotland. They have introduced the poll tax and have opted out schools and hospitals; they have introduced compulsory competitive tendering; and have reduced the power of our democratically elected councils. How, in a modern democracy, can that be right? How trivial the west Lothian question or the Cook doctrine—or whatever it is called—appear beside this major weakness in the British constitution.<br><br>
To be fair to the Tories, they have transferred increasing responsibility to the Scottish Office. In doing so, they have highlighted the lack of democratic control over Scottish affairs. They have helped to create the current crisis. Why cannot they now accept the next logical and democratic step, which is to establish a Scottish Parliament?<br><br>
The Minister and his colleagues argue that we have a unitary state, that this Parliament is sovereign and that within that framework they have a perfect right to govern Scotland. If we had a unitary state, we would not have the Scottish Office; we would not administer Scottish affairs in Scotland; we would not have our own legal system or our own education and health services; and we would not have separate Scottish legislation. The Tories cannot believe the claptrap that we have heard over the past few weeks in favour of status quo. The status quo is untenable and undemocratic. If the Tories were true to their arguments, and if the Minister were true to the logic of everything that he has said today, they would argue for the abolition of the Scottish Office and for the absorption of all its functions into the relevant United Kingdom Departments. They know that they cannot do that. They know that the Scottish people would not tolerate it. As they will not do that, they should not do anything else but support our case for a democratic Parliament in Scotland.<br><br>
Some parts of the media, the Minister today and his colleagues have tried to represent our proposals for constitutional change in Scotland as a shabby compromise between a separate nationalist state for Scotland and the status quo. Far from it. I believe that our proposals have much more to do with democracy than with nationalism. We live in one of the most centralised democracies in the western world. In Scotland, we have the ability to start a process in the United Kingdom of decentralisation. It will act as a catalyst for the rest of the United Kingdom. As others see the benefits to Scotland of democratic control over its own affairs so they will demand it, too. I do not know what the British constitution will be 20 years from now. What I am interested in doing is creating a more democratic society in Scotland and in the United Kingdom, now. Democracy is not about writing tightly bound constitutions, with every last dot and comma that will last for ever. Democracy is about giving power to people to control their own affairs—not just their own individual lives, as the Minister wants, but their affairs within their local communities, regions and nations and the country as a whole.<br><br>
I believe that our way forward is the tolerant, logical approach. It is what the Scottish people want and it is obtainable within the next few months. When returned to power at the general election, we will introduce legislation to establish a Scottish Parliament. That is achievable now. The Scottish National party has no hope of winning 37 seats in Scotland. A vote for the SNP can only help, however marginally, to keep this Government in power.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0012">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
The SNP has always worked for that aim because it believes that that will help its narrow, political ends. That is why it spends more time attacking the Labour party than the Tories. The people of Scotland will sensibly vote to ensure that we have a Labour Government who can bring about the change that all the latest opinion polls show they want.<br><br>
During the continuing debate on constitutional change, my colleagues have rightly shown that the achievement of a separate Scottish state would cause unnecessary dislocation and disruption, with membership of the European Community far from certain in the short term. The benefits of having such a state have been shown to be at best marginal and at worst non-existent, while the promises made by the SNP to the Scottish people—in the event of it forming a Government in this mythical state—border on the downright fraudulent. They make nonsense of its vaunted claim that it will win the election. No party that had even the most remote chance of forming a Government would indulge in the fairyland fantasies of the SNP.<br><br>
I have agued the case for a Scottish Parliament as a democrat. I am not a nationalist. Indeed, I find the political creed of nationalism abhorent. It is narrow-minded and limited in its vision. Too often in our political past it has been a corrosive element. Too often, even among the SNP, its philosophy has depended on hatred of others rather than pride in ourselves. Its philosophy is shown by history to divide people from people, while democracy strives to unite them. It is a creed that looks for scapegoats. It seeks to blame society's ills on foreigners and other races, instead of tackling the real enemies and causes. Too often it is an intolerant ideology which brooks no opposition.<br><br>
The Labour party is not against the breaking up of Britain because of fear or because we believe that a separate Scotland would not work; we are against it because we believe that these islands share common problems that need to be solved on a common basis. The scandal of poverty pay needs to be tackled urgently by the introduction of a minimum wage—north and south of the border. The recession has hit all parts of the country. There is a desperate need for jobs, training and investment throughout the whole of Britain. We shall be stronger if we co-ordinate our economic policy within the United Kingdom.</span></p>
<p>[MR. NORMAN HOGG <i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
<p>Elderly people in Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland all face the same daily struggle to make ends meet. Parents in all parts of Britain are forced to get by on inadequate child benefit payments. Labour's plans would help all people, wherever they lived in the United Kingdom. The Labour movement will not turn its back on poverty, homelessness or injustice simply because it happens in Newcastle or Manchester rather than in Edinburgh or Glasgow. Those are problems everywhere and we shall work to end them everywhere.</p>
<p>The SNP claims to be a socialist party. It is a strange sort of socialism that ends at Gretna Green or at Berwick-upon-Tweed. It is a strange sort of socialism that says, "I know that you are out of work, but unfortunately you are a Geordie and I will not help you." It is a strange sort of socialism that says, "You have been on the waiting list for an operation for two years, but are from Liverpool so why should I care." Scottish nationalists have insultingly tried to style themselves as the new Clydesiders.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
I find that most insulting to those men and women who fought to eradicate poverty everywhere in Britain and who would have had nothing to do with such a selfish turning of backs on those in need in England and Wales. It is equally certain that we in the Labour party today will have nothing to do with such policies.</p>
<p>A Scottish Parliament offers the Scots an opportunity to manage their own affairs in Scotland while still playing an active and, indeed, prominent part in the government of the United Kingdom and Europe. Its establishment would solve the Westminster question, which the Tories refuse to address, while still maintaining our strong links with the rest of the United Kingdom. A Scottish Parliament is not an abstract, arid, constitutional concept. It will play a part in improving the quality of life in Scotland and in developing a lively, democratic society that will be an example for others.</p>
<p>Most of all, we can deliver. If the latest opinion polls are right, five weeks from today we shall form the next Government. [HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] Labour's plans for a Scottish Parliament will be on the statute book within a year. No one else can offer that prospect with credibility. Labour alone offers a new Scotland, because only Labour can defeat this dreadful Government and win power.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. I seek your advice. I notice that, to your right, Scottish Office officials have been handing information to the Minister—</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to my point of order. The unit has been set up specifically to undermine our devolution proposals. I understand that public money is thereby being used for political purposes—[HON. MEMBERS: "Oh!"]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman should know that the conduct of the Scottish Office, its Ministers and civil servants is not a matter for the Chair. I call Mr. Watson.</span></p>

Instead of debating the constitutional effects of creating a Scottish Parliament, perhaps we should be discussing the constitutional effects of not creating a Scottish Parliament. We must be clear that the reason why we had our debate two weeks ago and why we are debating the issue today is that the people of Scotland have forced it on to the agenda. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I am willing to stop for a moment while the Minister receives advice from his civil servants.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. If the Minister wants to talk to his officials, it would be better if he came round to this side of the Table.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0013">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Watson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister was discussing with his civil servants the referral of the matter to the Lord Advocate, about which my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Darling) spoke earlier. This debate on the future of Scotland has not been brought about by the Government. Given the Minister's performance in Edinburgh and today, we know that the Government do not participate willingly in such a debate.<br><br>
The establishment of a Scottish Parliament will be put in train within a matter of months. The constitutional effects of that will be increased democracy and a movement away from the centralisation that has occurred during the past 13 years of Conservative rule. A process of responding to the European agenda will develop throughout the decade.<br><br>
Several Conservative Members have asked whether the Labour party is in favour of a federal structure in this country. The German system provides a good example of federalism. I do not know whether a federal structure will evolve. If it does, I would not necessarily be opposed to it, because it would have resulted from the desires of the people of England and Wales. I am arguing not just about what the Labour party will do for Scotland, but about what we will do for other regions of the United Kingdom, which will underscore and strengthen the creation of a Scottish Parliament.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) said, the creation of a Scottish Parliament will act as a catalyst. The Labour party is committed to providing an element of devolution in England in that development agencies will be established in the English regions. Incidentally, I do not accept the flannel about where East Anglia starts and where the east midlands finish, and so on. Standard regions are already established in England. They are used for economic planning and European funding. It will be a matter of building on that system.<br><br>
Clearly, the argument for devolution is more advanced in some parts of England than in others. The northern region, the north-west, Yorkshire and Humberside would take advantage of it. The south-west region, for example, has produced an interesting discussion document on establishing its own regional assembly. Matters will develop at a different pace. That is crucial to our debate.<br><br>
The Scots have made it clear what they want, and we are moving towards delivering it. Other people in the United Kingdom will realise the benefits of such a system. It will be a staged process. I accept the argument that a transitional stage of developing Scotland's Parliament could lead to what is described as the west Lothian question, but that is not fundamental to our debate. It is not vital to resolve that the day after establishing a Scottish Parliament. The creation of a Scottish Parliament will be the first step in a devolved structure of government throughout the United Kingdom.<br><br>
Ultimately, it may be necessary to reduce the number of Scottish Members of the Westminster Parliament, but in so doing we would take into account the United Kingdom as a whole. If central Government had fewer responsibilities, less need to meet so often and fewer matters to discuss, we might need considerably fewer than 650 elected Members of Parliament at Westminster. It would not be inappropriate to reduce the Scottish representation within that context. There are historical reasons for the number of Members of Parliament and it is unnecessary to say that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
72 Scottish Members are far too many to override those reasons. There are far more important matters to consider in the wake of the creation of a Scottish Parliament.<br><br>
The devolution of power necessarily means greater democracy. Our proposals are clear about that. Some of my hon. Friends referred to the position in other countries. It is an inescapable fact that, over the past 10 years. Denmark, Italy, Belgium, Portugal, Spain and France have devolved power from the centre. Sweden, which will join the European Community in 1995, has, too. The German model has been well-established for almost 40 years. We should be learning from those examples. I do not understand what those who oppose devolution have to fear from that system. They claim to fear that it will mean the break-up of the United Kingdom, but I believe that it will be strengthened through a devolved and perhaps even a federal structure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We fear the instability that would arise. Less than 9 per cent. of the United Kingdom population live in Scotland; 83 per cent. of its population live in England. Therefore, the hon. Gentleman is saying that those who live in England—who are not necessarily English—will have to accept a federal structure whether or not they want it, because that is the first step. I understand the logic of the Liberal Democrats' case to introduce all the changes at once, but it is illogical to suggest that there will not be an English backlash.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Watson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know what will be the reaction of people in England, but there is already considerable interest in regional assemblies in England—far more than in 1978–79, when we were last asked for our opinion on that important matter. I do not know whether there should be regional governments in England, or a Government for England itself that would sit alongside those for Wales and Scotland. It is for the English people to decide how far they want to devolve power—and I believe that it will devolve when they see the benefits to the Scots and Welsh. Those benefits will be self-evident and everything will flow from that. Of course, it will take time, because it will be a matter of proceeding by stages, but Conservative Members cannot argue against that.<br><br>
We continually see lessons ignored. I am astonished by the number of members of the Scottish Conservative party who have changed their position in recent years. Clearly, there is division among its parliamentary candidates, local association chairpersons, and, no doubt, some of its sitting Members of Parliament—although they have been capped tightly. The Secretary of State seems to be the only person who is determined to hold the breach and he is supported today by the Minister.<br><br>
The Prime Minister made a 190-minute, flying visit to Scotland—a patronising event if ever there was one. Although his feet barely touched Scottish ground during his visit, he seemed to realise that there is a wind of change and that there must be a re-evaluation in Scotland after the election. Stock will have to be taken—to put it mildly.<br><br>
Those lessons are not being learnt to any extent in the Conservative party. If there were any doubt about that, today's edition of <i>The Scotsman</i> gives a prime example. Its front page headline states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Mackay hints at greater say for Scotland after election."</p></blockquote>
That will have the people of Scotland on the edges of their seats with excitement. Lord Mackay cited recent examples of Scots having a greater say in their own affairs,
<br><blockquote><p>"such as the creation of the Scottish Heritage Agency".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0014">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
That is big-time stuff. He also mentioned the introduction of the funding council for higher education in Scotland and said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I believe this is something that can be further developed post-election."</p></blockquote>
Certainly, that is likely to pull in a lot of votes for the Conservative party.<br><br>
In Lord Mackay of Clashfern's interview to <i>The Scotsman</i> he summed up the matter rather neatly. The article states:
<br><blockquote><p>"You said that there are probably other ways of giving Scots more of a say in their own affairs. After the election, what might you have in mind?"</p></blockquote>
Lord Mackay replied:
<br><blockquote><p>"Well, I've got only a rather limited vision therefore I have to look at what is proposed."</p></blockquote>
He has a very limited vision, as have his friends in the Conservative party in Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William McKelvey <span class='memberconstituency'>(Kilmarnock and Loudoun)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend should not be overwhelmed by what he reads in Conservative manifestos. That party's 1974 manifesto said that there would be a form of devolution but, more shatteringly, it stated that a new Hampden was top of its list of priorities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Watson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will not be drawn into a discussion on Hampden, for a number of reasons.<br><br>
Earlier, reference was made to the dangerous game being played in the polarisation of the debate. I shall not echo the points my hon. Friends made about the Government's position, but I must comment on the position of the Scottish National party because it is riddled with cynicism. The SNP has an argued position that we understand but do not accept. Implicit in it is a preparedness to see the defeat of the Labour party and another term of Conservative Government throughout Scotland—with all that would mean for the health service, employment, training, and all other aspects of life. The SNP is prepared to say to the people of Scotland, "You must tolerate a further five years of that." The Scottish people have had a lot to endure in the past 13 years, but if there is another Conservative Government, they ain't seen nothing yet.<br><br>
The Scottish National party is prepared to say to the people of Scotland, "You must bear that burden, so that the Labour party is defeated and a Scottish Parliament is not created." That is a cynical approach. It will be increasingly highlighted throughout the campaign, and our plans will gain favour among the people of Scotland. The status quo is not an option, and that debate will be central to the general election campaign. The Scottish people demand change. They want control over their affairs. They know what they want and how to get it, and they will take that step within five weeks to ensure that the process begins.</span></p>
<p>11.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Ray Michie <span class='memberconstituency'>(Argyll and Bute)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: As we argue about constitutional change, we hear much about the Union. The Minister referred to the fact that it was formed almost 300 years ago. It might be appropriate to consider the Union more closely, although if one were to go out into Sauchiehall street and ask the first person one met, "What do you think of the Union?", the likely answer would be, "Which one?"<br><br>
The Union was born in 1707 out of—we are told—a bankrupt Scotland, threats of the aliens Act, the ending of the cattle and linen trade between the two countries and a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
puckle of gold changing hands. It was not a popular move as it was the work of only a handful of Scots—a parcel of rogues, as the hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Mr. McKelvey) reminded us. I have often wanted to ask him how many people he thinks were included in that parcel of rogues. The figure of nine springs to mind.<br><br>
The result was the grafting of the Scottish Parliament on to the English Parliament without the consent of either the Scottish or English people. For Scotland to have given up its legislative body is a stain on Scottish history. It is a mistake that should be redressed. Contrary to the Secretary of State's comment in the Scottish Grand Committee in Edinburgh, it took us into the most unequal partnership. The figures speak for themselves. The population of England is 45 million, whereas that of Scotland is 5 million. The number of Members of Parliament from north of the border is 72 whereas from south of the border—firth of Scotland—it is 578. There is the rub.<br><br>
The political heart was torn out of the nation. Scotland left itself no mechanism whereby it could legally say, "Sorry, it was a mistake. We want to re-establish our own Parliament. But how?" The only way open to us is through opinion polls and the ballot box. How weak that ballot box is. Repeatedly the Scots have said that the status quo is no longer an option. They want constitutional change—they elected 63 out of the 72 Scottish Members of Parliament to articulate that desire for change.<br><br>
Who is ranged against us in the House? Nine Scots and, with a few honourable exceptions, the other Tory Members—367 all told. There may be some others in the House from other parties. What right have those who come from another nation to keep saying no to Scotland? We come from two very different traditions. England believes in the absolute sovereignty of Parliament; Scotland believes in the absolute sovereignty of the people—with Parliament the servant, not the master. The Union is not working, and I and my party want the treaty to be renegotiated.<br><br>
It cuts no ice to have the Prime Minister swinging into Scotland saying, "I try to understand the emotional point, but the answer is still no."<br><br>
It does not become a Secretary of State for Scotland—indeed, it demeans his office—to rubbish the Scottish Constitutional Convention proposals and, by implication, those who painstakingly worked for more than three years to produce them. The sad fact is that neither the Secretary of State not the Prime Minister have anything to offer, and they have nothing to say.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am listening extremely carefully to the hon. Lady's interesting speech. Will she clarify the differences between her party, as outlined in the policy to which she has just referred, and the Scottish National party?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Michie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. If he will wait a moment, I shall tell him my party's policies.<br><br>
The Government ignore the example of other countries where different degrees of autonomy work. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) is right to speak about Spain and its "asymmetric federalism", as my right hon. Friend the Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Sir D. Steel) called it the other day in the Scottish Grand Committee. That was an excellent description.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0015">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
There are different levels of autonomy in Spain. When my colleagues and I visited the Basque country and Catalonia, particularly the chambers of commerce, business men assured us that it was to their great benefit to have their own Governments that they could speak to and influence, which could help them to develop their businesses.<br><br>
The majority of the Scottish people do not wish to sever their constitutional links with the rest of the United Kingdom, but they want to look after their own affairs. So what is the answer? My party and I see the convention proposals as the first step towards a federal United Kingdom—and federalism means power sharing. I am pleased to hear the word "federalism" being used by not only the Minister and his colleagues but Labour Members. Hon. Members need look no further than our federal party publication, "We the people", or the Scottish Liberal Democrats' document, "Sovereignty and Integration", to learn how federalism would work in the United Kingdom. I hope that the Minister will take the time to read those documents.<br><br>
A federal United Kingdom is the only reasonable, sane, and sensible answer. It has been endorsed by many, including the Minister, who acknowledged it today, and the Secretary of State's two predecessors. It is the answer also to the west Lothian question. A Scottish Parliament would have control over all its domestic affairs. All revenues generated in Scotland would go to the Scottish exchequer, and an annual payment made to the federal Government for agreed services. There would be a Scottish Parliament, a Welsh senate, a Northern Ireland Assembly when that becomes possible, and an English Parliament. It would be for England to decide whether to devolve powers to its own regions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: And if it does not?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Michie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That would be up to England. We would then have a federal Parliament linking the four countries, responsible for such matters as foreign affairs, defence and any others agreed by the constituent nations.<br><br>
I invite the Minister and his colleagues to consider those proposals. I have tried to concentrate on the principle rather than the economics, which have been covered extensively by others during the debate. That principle encompasses the fundamental right of the Scottish people to decide how their nation should be governed. The Government are profoundly wrong to refuse to contemplate change. By resorting to blackmail and the all-or-nothing threat, they do the Union a great disservice.<br><br>
The Government have demonstrated a paucity of thought, a blinkered, head-in-the-sand approach, and a complete lack of understanding and vision. The Prime Minister called the issue, "a running sore". The right hon. Gentleman should understand that the wound is deepening all the time.<br><br>
The matter will not go away until it is resolved to the satisfaction of the Scottish people. Generations of Scots in the past, and thousands of individuals and families today, have committed themselves to fighting for the reestablishment of our Scottish Parliament. That fight will continue</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
<p>11.41 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs. Michie) was so brief, because she did not answer many of the questions that have been addressed to her party today and in the past. In his excellent speech, my hon. Friend the Minister of State shot to pieces points that the Opposition Members would have made, even before they made them. Opposition Members have been taken to the cleaners in the debate—they have really been upset. It is informative to sit on this side of the Committee and to watch Opposition Members looking gloomier and gloomier as they see their case disappearing by the second. They must be full of chagrin that their case and prospects have steadily diminished over recent weeks in the polls.<br><br>
The Conservatives have always said that the issue should be put before the people—it is for them to decide, but they must decide on a fair prospectus. The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) totally failed, as has his party, to put a fair prospectus to the people. Many of us thought that the poll of a few weeks ago that showed 50 per cent. of Scottish people against independence was a rogue poll, hyped up by certain newspapers and the media, but it is now clear that it showed a trend that is steadily returning. People are swinging back to the view of Conservatives and Unionists that Scotland should remain part of the United Kingdom. There is not a majority, but there is a definite trend. The polls show that, as people begin to understand the arguments, the percentage against Scottish independence is significantly increasing—from 8 per cent. last weekend to around 30 per cent. and 40 per cent. this week. That is the value of the debate in Edinburgh and of the debate today. Labour has singularly failed to prove its case. It has been guilty of misrepresentation.<br><br>
It is difficult to secure detailed coverage of the arguments, to enable the public to decide on the facts of the issue, and that is my objective today. Opposition Members so often think that the status quo consists of looking to the past. Devolution has always been a matter of evolution. The Convervatives have supported devolution in the past. The word "devolution" has been hijacked by Labour and given a meaning that it does not have in the dictionary.<br><br>
Twenty years ago, devolution meant what it is—administrative devolution to Scotland through the Scottish Office, and then through regional councils and district councils. Throughout the century, power has been devolved to Edinburgh from Westminster through the Scottish Office and the Secretary of State. But the word now tends to mean a Scottish Assembly or, worse still, independence. It is important for the people of Scotland to realise that devolution means what I say it means—administrative devolution—and not an Assembly, which is a different kettle of fish.<br><br>
Significantly, this week's MORI poll showed that 23 per cent. of the sample thought that constitutional change was important. That means that 77 per cent. believe that it is less than important. Far too many people in Scotland think that is the only issue that matters in the election—far from it. A sound economy and an improved quality of life are infinitely more important than the expensive solution suggested by the Opposition.<br><br>
The Labour party produced a manifesto—I am not sure who presented it—in which the key issue was a Scottish
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0016">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
Parliament to give Scotland a heart in Europe. I wonder how that would be done. My hon. Friend the Minister showed how much less of a say we would have in Europe, were there to be a Scottish Parliament.<br><br>
On the condescending way in which there should be an equal number of women in a Scottish Parliament, women should be there on merit and by right, if they are to be there at all. It is sad that there are so few women in the Westminster Parliament. The same can be said of regional and district councils throughout Scotland. Women should be elected on their own merit—they have every entitlement to be Members—but they should not be chosen simply because they are women.<br><br>
Labour suggests that there should be a Ministry for Scottish women and a Ministry for Scottish justice. That policy will cause more and more centralisation; devolving power not to the people, but to an expensive bureaucracy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. John Reid <span class='memberconstituency'>(Motherwell, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. We have to hurry up. I am disappointed; the hon. Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galloway), who might well be the Speaker of a new Scottish Parliament, is the one hon. Member to whom I might have given way, because then he might have learnt some manners. The best thing about him is his name—belted-something Galloway. I hope that he shows the intent of purpose of a Galloway bull more effectively than he has done for his constituents.<br><br>
We want some questions answered especially by the Scottish National party, which keeps telling us that an independent Scotland will have exceptionally strong defence. At present, there are nine Scottish regiments, plus supporting service men. In a year or two—though I hope that the Government have second thoughts—there will be seven regiments and supporting service men. Are they guaranteed to have a role in an independent Scotland under the Scottish nationalists? I want to know, because service men in Scotland want to know. The people of Scotland should know whether the RAF stations at Kinloss, Lossiemouth, Leuchars, Turnhouse, Prestwick, Buchan, West Frough and Edzell would still exist. Would there be a career structure for Scottish service men in future? <i>[Interruption.]</i><br><br>
We want to know more also about the Liberal Democrats' policy on voting. <i>[Interruption.]</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I cannot hear the hon. Gentleman for background noise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown), who will be visiting Scotland shortly, told the other party leaders that there is no use lifting the phone to ring him without conceding proportional representation. Does that mean that the Liberal Democrats would vote against a Queen's Speech if there were a Labour Government who proposed a Scottish Parliament without PR? Would the Liberal Democrats oppose such a Bill? We want to know where they stand—or must we listen to the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy)? I do not know whether he is sitting on the fence or acting as a reporter for <i>The Scotsman.</i><br><br>
We should like to see some unanimity among the various Opposition parties about their propositions, which are supposed to impress the Scottish electorate. As my hon. Friend the Minister put it clearly, are we to have a federal solution? That would seem to be the only
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
reasonable way forward if there is to be a Scottish Parliament, a Welsh Parliament and an English Parliament, with an overall federal Government for the United Kingdom. Are we to have a Secretary of State for Scotland? That is a simple question, but the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) cannot tell us who will represent Scotland in the Cabinet. We have not yet had an answer to the west Lothian problem or the Livingston problem. All those issues are of interest to the people of Scotland. They do not want to buy a pig in a poke—something that has not been clearly and effectively explained.<br><br>
Then we have Isobel Lindsay and her new tactical voting scheme, promoted by the Scottish Nationalists and the Liberal nationalists, or whatever they are called—and Mr. McCreadie seems to want independence rather than an assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jimmy Hood <span class='memberconstituency'>(Clydesdale)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Isobel Lindsay and I disagree on a number of things, but she is a constituent of mine and I feel obliged to defend her. Would not the hon. Gentleman defend Isobel Lindsay's right to express her point of view in anyway that she sees fit? In a democratic society, everyone has the right of free speech.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course everyone is entitled to put their own views, but they should bear in mind their responsibility to the party that they represent.<br><br>
The people of Scotland will return to the key issues—the economy and their quality of life. What will happen about taxation and resources? Where shall we stand? Will there be different levels of inflation between Scotland and England, and different interest rates? People worry about such things—particularly those who live in a border constituency such as mine, with Gretna Green and Langholm close by. They are interested to know whether interest rates between England and Scotland will differ, and whether they should bank in Carlisle or Dumfries. It might make a lot of difference.<br><br>
Those are points of detail, but they are of key importance to the people of Scotland. They feel, also that industry is being misrepresented. Industry is gravely concerned that there will be five, six, seven, eight, nine or 10 years of uncertainty while a Scottish Parliament is developed. Like other hon. Members, I received the EURAM consultancy report yesterday. It says that
<br><blockquote><p>"65 per cent of respondents believe that 'continuing parly union with no substantial change to government within Scotland' is the best way forward for Scotland."</p></blockquote>
I am sure that is the general opinion of all those who represent industry and commerce and those who provide jobs in Scotland.<br><br>
In our debate in Edinburgh, and the debates in the Usher hall and elsewhere, on the future of the people of Scotland, my hon. Friend the Minister has shown that our case for retaining the Union is cast-iron. My hon. Friend highlighted arguments today that have not been answered. When those debates are put to the people of Scotland, as they will be in the weeks before the general election, they will see that the Union is the way forward for the people of Scotland.</span></p>
<p>11.54 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander Eadie <span class='memberconstituency'>(Midlothian)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: At the outset, I must say that my support for devolving legislative power from Westminster to a Scottish Parliament is based on the fact that it would make for better government. The government of the United Kingdom is far too centralized
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0017">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
for a country the size of ours. That policy of over-centralisation was accelerated, particularly during the Thatcher years.<br><br>
One does not have to be especially perceptive to know that the functions of the Scottish Grand Committee would be better carried out in Scotland, by an elected Parliament. Housing, health, education, local government policy and so on would be better dealt with by Scottish Ministers in a Scottish Parliament. In its own Parliament, Scotland could decide its priorities and the allocation of the available resources.<br><br>
Scotland is ill-described as a region of the United Kingdom. It is a nation and country with its own special characteristics. One of the problems drawn to my attention is the ill-feeling and conflict that we experience in education. I am told by those with more experience than I that that ill-feeling arises because of people who could be described as deracinated Scots, whose eyes look south of the border and who ignore the traditions of Scottish education.<br><br>
The main test of the argument for a Scottish Parliament is whether our people would thereby be governed better. The answer is an overwhelming yes. The most depressing aspect of the debate is Government policy. They argue for the the maintenance of the status quo, as the Minister did when he introduced today's debate. That is a poor response to the debate that is taking place in Scotland about a legislative Parliament for Scotland, and it is unacceptable in the present climate of opinion in Scotland. Experienced politicians should realise that.<br><br>
One of the Tories' bull points is the west Lothian question, which has been raised in this debate. In the climate of argument, discussion and debate in Scotland, the most important issue confronting us is not the west Lothian question but the Westminster question, and whether we want to retain the Union. That will be the important question at the forthcoming election. Does any member of the Committee imagine that there will not be a crisis?<br><br>
With the best will and all the political optimism in the world, the Tories' electoral prospects are not good. What will happen if only one or two Conservative Members of Parliament are returned in Scotland? What will happen if none is returned? That is possible—but two or three is an optimistic estimate. The Minister must know that his chances of participating in another debate in a Scottish Grand Committee are practically nil. That is why the Westminster question, not the west Lothian one, is important.<br><br>
Last weekend, big guns were imported into Scotland from the Tory Cabinet to argue for the status quo. That is unacceptable. When I listened to extracts of their speeches on television, the noises that they were making seemed more like those of water pistols than of big guns. I heard the Secretary of State for the Home Department claiming on television that he was in Scotland to pronounce on such matters because he had experience of fighting parliamentary elections and had been chairman of the Conservative party. I did not realise that such authority should be thrust on my shoulders because I had fought nine parliamentary elections and was an election agent in 1950, 1951 and 1955. Another factor gives me greater authority than him—all of those elections were fought in Scotland. So on the question
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
of expertise and authority, I humbly submit to the Committee that I have greater authority than the Home Secretary. The less said about the Home Secretary's chairmanship of the Tory party, the better. It was not a distinguished period. Yet, perhaps I should be kind because a distinguishing feature of it was his ability to make defeat sound like victory.<br><br>
We are meeting in the climate of an impending election and slogans are pertinent. This stricture applies to all parties. I believe the media describe the search for a slogan as "the big idea". If the slogan is right, everything will be fine in the election. The SNP is engaged in that search and has produced the juvenile jingle of, "Scotland Free by '93". When I was clearing out my room I discovered an article that I wrote for a local paper many years ago. It related to a presidential election in the United States of America in which Barry Goldwater participated. The Republican party produced the wonderful slogan, "In your heart, you know he's right." The Democrats replied with their slogan, "In your guts, you know he's nuts." I apply that stricture to all political parties that try to think up wonderful slogans.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Midlothian (Mr. Eadie) for giving way in what, sadly, will be his last speech to the Scottish Grand Committee. I remind him of a former Labour party candidate who appeared to share his views in an election leaflet which criticised
<br><blockquote><p>"the S.N.P. habit of chanting slogans which have sound but no substance."</p></blockquote>
The leaflet concluded by inviting the people in his Scottish constituency to use their common sense and give the SNP another rejection. The Labour candidate in that 1970 election was Jim Sillars.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eadie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend raises a tempting prospect. I do not blame people for changing their minds, but it is dangerous to indulge in quotations. With regard to talk about what may happen in future, Kilbrandon came out firmly against federation and separatism, according to a pamphlet with which the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Sillars) was associated. I leave the matter at that.<br><br>
[MR. MICHAEL J. MARTIN <i>in the Chair.</i>]<br><br>
The SNP made a serious, tactical error by not joining the Scottish Constitutional Convention which has probably helped to highlight the political divide in the next election. The SNP will be allied to the Tories—there is no question about that. If it does well, it will have thrown a lifeline to the Tories.<br><br>
I am not unhappy that my party will fight the election opposing the SNP and Conservative policy of the status quo. I remember the previous devolution debate in which I campaigned vigorously. The questions that arose from the 40 per cent. vote were monstrous. I discovered that the SNP's support polluted the campaign because the people of Scotland did not want to consider separation. Much of the electorate equated those Assembly proposals with separatism. I am happy that there is now a sharp divide between us.<br><br>
Some hon. Members are muttering in front of me. I am trying to give my views as briefly as possible. I shall listen to the hon. Member for Govan if he catches your eye, Mr. Martin. I am trying to put to the Committee a very sincere point of view because my political career is now coming to an end. I have had experience in the legislature and in the

Administration, and I am bidding a fond farewell after 26 years in Parliament. I am happy to campaign for my party in the forthcoming election because we will be able to say to the Scottish people, "If you want a Parliament, the only way to get it is to return a Labour Government at the next election".</span></p>
<p>12.6 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Norman A. Godman <span class='memberconstituency'>(Greenock and Port Glasgow)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will try to be brief because other hon. Members wish to speak. I wish to put on record my grateful thanks to my hon. and old Friend the Member for Midlothian (Mr. Eadie) for his fine, final speech.<br><br>
The Minister sought robustly to defend the status quo; I shall criticise it. Everyone now knows that the Scottish people are faced with three options: the status quo, a Scottish Parliament within a reformed Union as advocated by the convention or, what might charitably be called, an independent land of milk and honey. When considering the parliamentary representation of the people of Scotland we should discuss, however briefly, the role of three parliaments—the European Parliament, the Westminster Parliament and the Parliament proposed by the convention or the nationalists.<br><br>
On the protection of the interests of Scottish people, the European Parliament is a toothless watchdog compared with those extraordinarily powerful central institutions: the Council of Ministers and the Commission. The European Parliament will inevitably increase its powers and grow in stature when, on 1 January 1993, the European Community becomes the European Union—if that is sanctioned by the 12 national legislatures. That will be a political and economic union of 12 autonomous nations—not independent nations.<br><br>
With the growing power of the European Community will come a parallel weakening of the Westminster Parliament. No one can gainsay that fact. There will be a continuing diminution of the power of the Westminster Parliament. The Minister, in his robust defence of the status quo—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Union.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Godman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The status quo—offered the classic Conservative argument that the moment was not right—it was not propitious to have radical constitutional change. He ignores the fact that the power of this Parliament is slipping away because of the European Single Act and because of decisions taken in the European Commission and in the Council of Ministers. What about the weakness of Parliament against a powerful Government?<br><br>
The Minister defends the status quo. He is in good company. One venerable parliamentarian who sought to defend this Parliament was Enoch Powell, who wrote:
<br><blockquote><p>"The House of Commons is the personification of the people of Britain: its supremacy is synonymous with their self-government and freedom."</p></blockquote>
I said that the Minister was in good company. Enoch Powell continued:
<br><blockquote><p>"Through the centuries Britain has created the House of Commons and the House of Commons has moulded Britain, until the history of the one and the life of the one cannot be separated from the history and life of the other."</p></blockquote>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Benn) would join the chorus for the defence of the status quo. His book, "Arguments for Democracy", assures us that despite all the powers of Ministers,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"The ultimate power of the House of Commons to topple a prime minister remains unaffected … The very fact that these powers are there operates to restrict and restrain the exercise of power by premiers and ministers."</p></blockquote>
Who are they kidding? Parliament has been weakened over the past 13 years by a harsh Government.<br><br>
I can give one example—if you, Mr. Martin, will forgive the conceit—on which I campaigned vigorously for some time, in seeking to bring the law of Scotland into line with that of England, for the protection of children caught up in child abuse and sexual abuse cases. The Government—that odd-job lot—steadfastly resisted amendments to such legislation. England has the Children Act 1989, which gives considerable protection to children caught in those horrid cases. We in Scotland lag far behind. That is just one example.<br><br>
We do not have a Select Committee to monitor the Scottish Office. This Committee is our only talking shop. If Parliament had the representational powers highlighted and exemplified by my right hon. Friend the Member for Chesterfield and by Mr. Enoch Powell, we would never have had the poll tax or other repressive legislation inflicted upon us.<br><br>
Conservative Members have said that the present Government have weakened the role of Parliament. The right hon. Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (Mr. Heath) and the hon. Member for Harrow, East (Mr. Dykes) made those complaints during the passage of the Official Secrets Act 1989. The present Government treat Parliament with contempt.<br><br>
For all the loose ends that are contained in the model Parliament offered by the convention, it is an advance on the weakened Parliament at Westminster that we have now. On the basis of my nine years' experience here, I would happily join a Parliament in Edinburgh. I would be delighted to become the fisheries Minister, but I am not touting for a job. My argument is not that the status quo is untenable, but that it is utterly weak and one-sided, because it ignores the contemptuous treatment inflicted upon Parliament and its elected representatives by an over-strong Government who were elected on a minority vote. I want to see that Government disappear. I want to see in their place a Scottish Parliament within a reformed United Kingdom, representing one of those autonomous—not independent—nations of the European unit. If that is federalism, I buy it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Several Hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I want to honour the promise that I made at our sitting in Edinburgh. There is time left for only two more speeches. The wind-up speeches will begin at 12.32 pm.</span></p>
<p>12.16 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon McMaster <span class='memberconstituency'>(Paisley, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be hard to find common ground in the views that have been expressed in the Committee. The one exception is that a general election will be held in the next few weeks, when the Scottish people can decide their future. At that time, the four main political parties will present their manifestos, so that the electorate can make up their mind about the different priorities and different policies.<br><br>
Three options will be open to the people. The status quo is advocated by the Tories. Separation and isolation is proposed by the Scottish National party. The creation of a strong Scottish Parliament is supported by the Labour party, the Liberal Democratic party, 80 per cent. of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0019">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 27</span>
Scottish Members, 90 per cent. of Scottish local authorities, the Churches, the Scottish Trades Union Congress and others.<br><br>
At the general election, four political parties will put forward three options, but we know that, in reality, there can be only two possible outcomes. People will vote either for the Labour party, which will result in a Scottish Parliament, or Tory or SNP, which will result in a Tory Government. The SNP, of course, argues that it can win a majority of seats and that it will take us to complete independence—but no opinion poll or sensible political commentator suggests that that will happen.<br><br>
Even the SNP only goes so far as to say that if it wins enough votes, it will be in power. That is equally true of the Monster Raving Loony party: if it wins enough votes, it will be in power. To take a more extreme example, that could apply also to the Tory party—but that is highly unlikely. The Scottish peole know the difference between probabilities and possibilities—and that there are four parties and three options, but only two outcomes.<br><br>
Let us first consider the status quo. I prefer the traditional definition. At our previous sittings on 24 February, the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I am not in favour of the status quo if that would exclude all change,"</p></blockquote>
I suspect that the hon. Gentleman made a Freudian slip. One wing of the Tory party says that it is prepared to consider change, provided that change would not change anything. The Secretary of State does not accept that approach. In the same debate, he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"There is no need to offer a cure for which there is no known disease."—[<i>Official Report, Scottish Grand Committee,</i> 24 February 1992; c. 52, 11.]</p></blockquote>
That statement illustrates better than anything else why the Secretary of State is not fit to hold office.<br><br>
Let me diagnose the disease. The people of Scotland elected 72 Members of Parliament, nine of whom are Conservative Members, while the remaining 63 are Opposition Members. Yet the Conservative party is in Government. That is diseased democracy. Conservative Members must get ready to be force-fed medicine and to swallow some bitter pills at the general election. Conservative Members hope that those bitter pills will be sweetened by some SNP sugar, which is why there is a conspiracy between the two parties. The Conservative party wants to slip up the middle and win a few seats.<br><br>
There is a concept in biology known as symbiosis, meaning that two distinct beings have a relationship that is beneficial to one another. In other words, each feeds off the other; they are both parasite and host. Such a relationship exists between the Tories and the SNP. If anyone disbelieves that there is a conspiracy, I draw attention to the Prime Minister's remarks about the SNP in the <i>Glasgow Herald.</i> He spoke of
<br><blockquote><p>"a stark clarity. It is in one sense a brave position."</p></blockquote>
First, the SNP had the support of James Bond, then of the "super soaraway <i>Sun",</i> and now of the Tory Prime Minister. It would have been far better sticking with people such as Isobel Lindsay, and the great provost of Perth and Kinross.<br><br>
I believe in home rule, but we can have home rule and still maintain our links with the United Kingdom. If people accuse me of wanting the best of both worlds, I
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
plead guilty. The SNP says that it wants Scotland to have a stronger position in Europe, but, as I understand it, Scotland would gain only 16 seats out of the 526 seats in the European Parliament, and three out of the 79 seats in the Council for Ministers. By any calculation, that is a smaller not a larger, representation. The SNP should ask Alf Young of the <i>Glasgow Herald</i> to check its figures.<br><br>
The convention is the best way forward. To sum up, I shall use these words:
<br><blockquote><p>"This is certainly less dramatic that the SNP habit of chanting slogans which have sound but no substance. But it is a more effective way of finding a solution to the problem without tearing Britain apart. It is the method of approach which reasonable and sensible people can and do support."</p></blockquote>
Those are not my words—I wish that they were—but those of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Sillars) when he was Member of Parliament for South Ayrshire. People have a right to change their minds, but one of my constituents recently decribed the hon. Member for Govan as the sort of man who would cut down a tree and stand on the stump to make a speech on conservation.<br><br>
This week, I received a letter from the SNP candidate who will stand against me in Paisley, South. He has said that the only way to rid the people of Paisley of the threat of nuclear dumping is to have complete independence. I wrote back pointing out that Dounreay is 308 miles from Paisley, but Sellafield is only 140 miles away. As far as I know, Hadrian's wall will not contain the fallout from Sellafield. If independence is achieved, problems that are common to this island must be solved within the island as a whole.<br><br>
I am pro-Scottish, but I refuse to be anti-English. I do not like slogans such as, "They've got yours". Who has? Is it the unemployed shipbuilder on Tyneside, the old-age pensioner in Liverpool or the young people who sleep under cardboard boxes on the streets of London? There is a difference between patriotism and jingoism. I am a patriot, but I refuse to be jingoistic as the SNP's policies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. How can we defend against our honour and integrity being impugned? In the previous speech, it was suggested that my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Perth and Kinross (Sir N. Fairbairn) and I would collaborate with our greatest enemy—the Scottish National party. How can we be defended against such an allegation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is interested in Scottish defence issues, so he knows how to defend himself.</span></p>
<p>12.23 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jim Sillars <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Govan)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted with the attacks on the Scottish National party. They are a big compliment to us. As Robbie Burns said, the mair they talk, the better we will be kent up and down the country. I hope that the attacks will continue.<br><br>
One of the most important political principles that Scottish people must understand is that Scotland is no different from any other nation on earth. As an iron-clad rule in human relations, if we do not exercise power over ourselves, power is exercised over us. That is precisely so in respect of devolution.<br><br>
A settlement within a unitary state cannot be delivered by the votes of the Scottish people alone. It can be delivered in Labour's package only if the people of England help to return a Labour Government. If they do
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0020">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 29</span>
not—if the coming election is like the previous three elections—there is nothing that Labour could do about delivering its package.<br><br>
We approach the issue of Scotland's self-government on this test: what would it do to create jobs? How could it tackle the housing and education problems, or deal with the problems facing our old people who have inadequate pensions and inadequate heat during the winter? How could it deal with the state of our national health service? To answer those questions one must ask whether it would have the power to create the apparatus for wealth creation and the mechanism for distributing wealth in society. If we listen to Bryan Gould and Gerald Kaufman—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes <span class='memberconstituency'>(Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. The hon. Gentleman has been in the House long enough to know that he must refer to Members of Parliament by their constituencies. Also—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman raised one point of Order. That will do for the time being.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is an arrogant little bugger.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman must withdraw that remark.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I withdraw it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be helpful if hon. Members would refer to right hon. and hon. Members by the names of their constituencies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sillars</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When they appeared on "On the Record" and the "Walden" programmes, both made it plain that on economic, industrial, trade, and taxation policy, this place would make the decisions—not the Edinburgh Parliament.<br><br>
On oil, Campbell Christie, a member of the Scottish Trades Union Congress and of the convention, said:
<br><blockquote><p>"On the North Sea, the Scottish Parliament would have a key role, with a veto, in determining UK policy for offshore development."</p></blockquote>
Is that true or is it not? If we had the draft Bill before us, we would know.<br><br>
As to control over local government the right hon. and learned Member for Monklands, East (Mr. Smith) told the Committee in Edinburgh that a Scottish Parliament would have to come to Westminster for borrowing consent. What about Scottish local government? Would it go to the Scottish Parliament for borrowing consent or would it, too, have to go to the Treasury in London for borrowing consent? As one applies the test of what a Scottish Parliament could do for Scotland's economic and social circumstances, one is increasingly driven to the conclusion that it could do nothing effective.<br><br>
We are told by Liberal Democrats that a devolved Parliament is a major priority for the Scottish people. We are told by their national leader and by the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce), speaking to Kirsty Wark on television, that unless Parliament concedes proportional representation from Westminster, they will not vote for a devolution package for Scotland, even if it has PR in it. They put the Westminster priority of their United Kingdom party first.<br><br>
I come now to what my old friend the hon. Member for Midlothian (Mr. Eadie) calls the Westminster question. I, too, want to ask the Westminster question: what will
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
happen if there is once again an English Tory majority in Parliament after the next election? The Scottish National party's position is clear. <i>[Interruption.]</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) must give the hon. Gentleman a hearing. It is unfair to the rest of the Committee if we cannot hear what is being said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sillars</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not terribly worried, Mr. Martin, although the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) is getting very anxious about his and his party's position. The Scottish National party's position is plain. It believes that the Scottish people have the right to choose the Government that they want. If they vote on polling day for a certain party to form a Government of Scotland, we believe that they are entitled to that, even if that party is not my own. There is a Labour answer to the Westminster question of an English Tory majority ruling Scotland. The Labour party would rather have an English Tory majority ruling Scotland than a Labour Government inside an independent Scottish Parliament. <i>[Interruption.]</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must tell the Committee that if the disorder continues, I will have to suspend the sitting. We must have calm and allow the hon. Gentleman to address the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sillars</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will repeat my remarks, for the third time. Labour Members are upset because I have said that they would rather have a Tory Government in the United Kingdom Parliament than a Labour Government within an independent Scotland. We must get that message over to the Scottish people and show the incredible position of the Scottish Labour party, which knuckles down to decisions taken south of the border. We will get the mandate and we will free the Scottish people.</span></p>
<p>12.31 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The more the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Sillars) speaks, the better it is not only for the Labour party but for everyone who believes in the future of Scotland. If ever there was a speech born of bitterness and desperation, that was it.<br><br>
I do not consider nationalism or separation an impossible option, but the Scottish people have been asking themselves over the past few weeks whether they really want a separate Army, a separate Air Force and a separate Navy. Do they really want a separate currency, with the barriers that that would erect between Scotland and England, when 60 per cent. of the Scottish finance houses' business is with England? Do they really want that extra imposition on Scotland? Do they really want a Mickey Mouse economy with low taxes but high spending—a programme that claims it can create 300 jobs a day and an embassy a week? It is not an impossible option—I just believe it is plain daft and undesirable.<br><br>
All the polls that ask Scottish people which option they want—devolution under Labour's plans, the status quo or separation—show clearly that support for Labour's proposals of a Scottish Parliament, in partnership with the United Kingdom Parliament, is steadily increasing for the reasons I have cited. That is why the hon. Member for Govan was so bitter and venomous towards other hon. Members.<br><br>
We should also examine the case made by the Minister in his knockabout attack on the Labour party. The argument advanced by the Conservative party against the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0021">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 31</span>
Scottish Parliament is not a constitutional or legal argument; it is far more basic. The Conservative party can see coming to an end its period of government, which has allowed it to impose policies on Scotland that no one in Scotland had voted for. The Conservative party has imposed the poll tax and testing on primary schoolchildren—setting child against child and school against school. It wants to publish discriminatory league tables. It has promoted privatisation and has undermined the health service, thereby creating a situation in which people will soon be forced to choose private health care.<br><br>
The Conservatives are not concerned about the constitutional niceties—they simply want to keep the right to govern Scotland and the rest of the country, in a way that is unacceptable to the vast majority of people. To be fair, not all Conservative Members agree with that. The right hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind) has been holding his peace on the subject. He has given hints, here and there, that he thinks something should be done. The Lord Chancellor has hinted that something should be done. The Prime Minister himself has called the present situation "a running sore" and said that he will take stock of it after the general election. No Conservative Member has told the Committee this morning what "taking stock" means. No one knows what the Conservative party really thinks, but we know that the Minister believes in the Union. He believes in promoting those policies that the Tories' centralising approach has enabled him to impose. Many other Conservative Members realise that the status quo is not an option and that it has been rejected by the people of Scotland, as have the narrow, blinkered policies of separatism.<br><br>
We believe that a consensus is growing in Scotland for a Scottish Parliament with a substantial degree of self-government, but in partnership with the United Kingdom. Devolution does not stop there. We believe that it is essential to establish a national Assembly in Wales. A strong case can be made for regional government in England, and there is growing support for that proposition. Indeed, that is happening throughout Europe. The approach to the problem varies from country to country. Germany has a federal system. Spain, which like the United Kingdom has distinct nations as well as regions, has gone for a blend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Seventeen.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister refers to seventeen autonomies, but they have different powers. There is substantial devolution to the Catalans and the Basques—something akin to the regional devolution that we propose for England and Wales. The argument advanced by Conservative Members that nothing can be done because nothing will work simply does not stand examination. Spain has followed its course successfully. France, which is traditionally a highly centralised country, has decentralised powers.<br><br>
Let us not lose sight of the fact that this is not a narrow academic argument. Constitutional matters are arid—the sort of subject loved by academics and which enthralls television commentators—but there is more to them than that. Government, whether of Scotland or the United Kingdom, has only one purpose; the delivery of services to the people. Government allows people to make a choice
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
—something that the Conservative party does not want. People in Scotland, as in the rest of the country, are slowly moving to get rid of the Government and their policies.<br><br>
The reason for decentralisation is powerful. First, it makes for economic success. The economy of the south-east of England was until last year grossly overheated. One could not move because of the congestion. Indeed, the plan of the Secretary of State for the Environment to build a new Gotham city on the south coast of the Thames would only add to that congestion. Yet, in the north of England, in Scotland and in parts of Wales there is a clear demand for Government investment. The economic case for decentralisation is powerful. That is one reason for Germany's success.<br><br>
I visited Germany with my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Central (Mr. Watson) earlier this year. We were struck by how the Länder identified the problems that they faced. The German Government then used the clout of their 80 million people to negotiate within the EC for the economic help needed, after which they stood aside, letting the Länder negotiate directly with Brussels. The same happens in Spain and France, but not here. We had the nonsense of the RECHAR scheme, with the Government deliberately trying to use EC money to subsidise their spending. The Government do not accept that different regions and nations have different requirements. That is one reason why their economic policy and political ideas are so bankrupt and why they are about to be rejected by the electorate. The economic case for decentralisation is strong.<br><br>
Scotland has a separate legal system. We have 7,000 civil servants and the whole paraphernalia of government, except an elected Assembly to make our decisions. That powerful, democratic case for decentralisation is unanswerable. The Government will not answer the central question: why should nine Members of Parliament control Scotland when every time in the past 13 years that the electorate has had the chance to exercise a choice, they have said no to the Tories, no to the poll tax, no to primary school testing and no to undermining the health service. No wonder the Government do not want to change. They are trying to cling on to what they have got.<br><br>
The Prime Minister is left feebly saying that he will take stock if all goes wrong—as I suspect it will. No wonder the Minister of State, and the Pariamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, who is not here at present, are trying to crank up SNP support. I see that Scottish National Members have all left, which shows what their priorities are. The SNP and the Tories want a Tory victory at the next election. They want Scotland to divide and people to turn against each other. The Tories hope that if that happens they will be able to pick up the scraps, but I do not believe that it will. I am convinced that the Labour party will increase its representation at the next election because we have a coherent policy, not only for Scotland but for the whole of the United Kingdom.<br><br>
We do not want to pull down the shutters on the rest of the United Kingdom. We should build on existing links. There are sound economic and strategic reasons for not erecting barriers between parts of the United Kingdom. Equally, there are sound political, social, economic and cultural reasons for setting up a Parliament in Edinburgh that is accountable to the people of Scotland, so that they may decide whether they like the Government they get.<br><br>
Have Conservative Members given up hope of winning any support in Scotland? If they thought that they could
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0022">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 33</span>
win it, why do not they support the idea of a Scottish Parliament? If Scotland votes for the Tories, that is a matter for the Scottish people. I believe that the reason why Tories are opposed to a Scottish Parliament is that they know they have no hope of being elected in the foreseeable future.<br><br>
I conclude on a point on which I touched earlier because it will become important in the next five weeks. In the past three months there has been a debate on the future of Scotland, which has been triggered by various factors. We should not lose sight of the opportunities that await Scotland. The general election will be in five weeks' time when we shall have an opportunity to create a Scottish Parliament. That is not a matter of academic interest because then we can start to rebuild Scotland. We can do something about the appalling level of pensions and the people who are sleeping rough on the streets of the capital city and other cities in Scotland. We can deal with the appalling housing crisis and rebuild education and training in the health service. That is what a Scottish Parliament means and those are the constitutional implications of setting it up.<br><br>
At the same time, we must not lose sight of the fact that the same problems exist throughout the whole of the United Kingdom. We want to give power back to people and we want constitutional reform because the arrangements that have lasted for 300 years no longer work. Even the Prime Minister accepts that they do not work when he refers to "a running sore". It ill becomes Conservative Members to defend a corner that they know they will have to abandon in five weeks' time. They are the people who defended the poll tax until a few weeks ago and said that our proposals were a roof tax.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They were.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Now they are implementing a roof tax with the same policies that they condemned two years ago, so it will surprise no one if the Minister gets up to defend the status quo. If he is here in five weeks time—I fear that he will not be present—he will have to defend a different corner.<br><br>
I am confident that, as a result of the debate that has taken place in the past three months or so, minds in Scotland are becoming concentrated. Its people know that the election is crucial for our constitutional future, but I do not believe that anyone wants to take a leap into the unknown of separation. Certainly, I do not believe that they want to vote for a party that says, "Elect us and we will decide when to give you free elections." What a third-world dictatorship approach to the people of Scotland. Surely, Tories cannot believe that the Scottish people will support a party with Mickey Mouse economics that appeals to desperation rather than offers a coherent strategy.<br><br>
The people of Scotland will reject those who have visited such devastation on Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom and in five weeks' time we can start to rebuild both. It is time for change in Scotland and the United Kingdom, and I am confident that we will get it.</span></p>
<p>12.43 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Darling) that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 34</span>
only one political party in Scotland has had a majority of votes since 1945 and that was the Conservative party in 1955. I look forward to the return of those days.<br><br>
I start with a quotation of immense significance which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is common knowledge that the Scottish economy became fully integrated with the rest of the UK during the first industrial revolution. Industrial and financial patterns set at that time have grown so profound that to separate them now would be as difficult as extracting the original acorn from a great oak."</p></blockquote>
Those are not my words, although I would have been proud to have written them. They are the words of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Sillars), written in "Don't Butcher Scotland's Future", in his Unionist prime. In those days, the hon. Gentleman came under the wise influence of the hon. Member for Midlothian (Mr. Eadie), but today he and his colleagues are threatening to butcher the United Kingdom. We are united in an implacable determination to stand by the Union, which we shall not allow to be blown away in the winds of history.<br><br>
Today, the hon. Member for Midlothian (Mr. Eadie) made his last speech. I pay tribute to him for the way he treated Back Benchers when he was a Minister. He mentioned the slogan "Scotland free by '93". In response, I can say only that we are determined "Scotland will not be on the floor by '94".<br><br>
We are defending the Union, not the status quo. Today's debate has been overshadowed by one fact: the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell), who coined the phrase "the west Lothian question" and whom we were all looking forward to hearing, has, unfortunately, been silent. Is he being like Achilles and resting in his tent before coming forth to commit mighty action? We long to know whom he will choose to be Hector. What has happened instead is that he has left his party's proposals with an indelible Achilles heel for the simple reason that the role of Scottish Members at Westminster is a key issue. It would be inconceivable to allow Scottish Members to vote on health, housing and education matters in England, but not to allow English Members to vote on health, housing and education matters in Scotland. Such a system could not endure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: No one likes to say anything about the Chairman, but I wish to put it on the record that I tried to speak in the debate, but was not called.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had looked forward to hearing the hon. Gentleman's contribution.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) said that, once there was a Scottish Parliament that handled health issues in Scotland, it would not be possible for him to be a Minister for Health in England. That is a devastating remark. Such a system means that distinguished Scottish Members would be debarred from holding major offices of state. That would be contrary to the spirit of the United Kingdom Parliament and it would undermine advancements that have been made.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Garscadden)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has made a strong point about disunity in the Labour ranks—honourable disunity, but limited. What does he say to his colleagues, Mr. Struan Stevenson or Mr. Brian Meek, whom he hopes—although in vain—will soon become Members of Parliament or, indeed, to the one third of the audience who listened to the Prime Minister?</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 35</span>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Exactly what I am saying to the Committee. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) referred to honourable disunity. That was highlighted by no less distinguished a person than Mr. Robbie Coltrane, who said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I would like to see Independence but only an independent Labour Scotland."</p></blockquote>
He then said:
<br><blockquote><p>"It would have to be terribly carefully considered. There are all sorts of advantages … to the United Kingdom and it would be foolish to throw it away immediately."</p></blockquote>
Emphasis was placed on the word "immediately". That underlines the thinking of Conservative Members. We believe that the end result has been correct and that Labour's proposals would put us on a slippery slope and provide us eventually with independence, whether the Scottish people want it or not.<br><br>
I refer to what the hon. Member for Govan wrote in "Don't Butcher Scotland's Future". I agree with every word; I could not have put it better myself. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"We must keep for Scotland her seat in the British Cabinet as of right. And we must continue to send our large number of Scottish MPs to Parliament at Westminster, where no matter what happens, crucial decisions bearing on Scotland and all the British Isles will continue to be taken."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The right hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Sir D. Steel) is a senior Member of the House. He should not be reading a newspaper in Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir David Steel <span class='memberconstituency'>(Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept your ruling, Mr. Martin. I was looking for Lord MacKay's forecasts that were reported today in <i>The Scotsman</i> and wondering whether they would be elucidated in the Minister's reply. However, I think that I was doing so in vain.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman referred to the number of Scottish Members and the role of the Secretary of State for Scotland. The Secretary of State for Scotland might be stripped of resources and of the power to legislate, but it would not stop there. He would not have the backing of the entire Department. In the Cabinet, it is essential that the Secretary of State gives advice not just on Scottish matters but on everything else. Without the backing of the whole Department, he would not speak with the same authority. It is questionable whether he would retain his place in the Cabinet. If he were to lose it, it would be bad for Scotland and the diminution of his role would be equally bad. Even worse would be the effect on the number of Scottish Members and the possibility of greatly reduced representation.<br><br>
After all, in the one part of the United Kingdom which had a devolved Assembly, Northern Ireland, parliamentary representation was much reduced, with no seat in the Cabinet for the Secretary of State. After Stormont prorogued, the numbers in this House were increased from 12 to 17. The same process applied in reverse to Scotland would mean that the creation of a Scottish Parliament could lead to a reduction in the number of Scottish Members to 40. Marginalisation of Scotland's ability to play her part in the mother of Parliaments would be the consequence of a Scottish Parliament.<br><br>
Opposition Members would do well to remember that out of the 10 smallest constituencies, in relation to average size, five are Labour seats in Glasgow. In particular, Garscadden comes 67th out of 72 in Scotland, or 644th out of 650 in Parliament as a whole, as a small constituency—the nearest 20th century equivalent to a pocket borough.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 36</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the Minister had a note of jealousy in his voice when he made that reference. He would perhaps like some security in his job prospects. Does the Minister favour that reduction? If a Labour Government implemented what the polls suggest that the largest section of Scottish opinion wants—that is, a devolved Parliament with a greater say over Scottish affairs—should there be, for that specific reason and not for general reasons, a reduction in Scottish representation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If that process were started—I oppose starting it—and if ever the hon. Gentleman were in that position, it would almost certainly not end there. He would be not simply taking a leap in the dark, but opening a Pandora's box.<br><br>
I want Scotland to retain her 72 Members of Parliament and a Secretary of State in the Cabinet. I want the full influence of Scotland in the United Kingdom Parliament, which the hon. Gentleman would reduce. On the other hand, the Liberals would reduce the number of Scottish Members to about 60. They are perhaps optimistic if they think that there would be as many as that under the proposals.<br><br>
I agree with my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister who said that the Labour party's proposals would mean the creation of two-tier Members. He described them as
<br><blockquote><p>"hobbled MPs from Scotland with half the power to vote, and members from every other nation with full authority on all the Business that came before the House. That is the recipe that, over time, would inevitably lead on to separation."</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for Garscadden, in response to the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond) said that he would oppose a devolution scheme that cut the number of Scots Members. In the debate a few days ago in Edinburgh, his answer was no to that.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs. Michie) wants to renegotiate the Treaty of Union. As for the Liberal Democrats, we heard their leader say that they would give higher priority to electoral reform for Westminster than to setting up of a Scottish Assembly. They claim that they regard constitutional reform as a matter of highest principle, but when it comes to reality it is plainly an example of electoral expediency coming decisively first. In any case, their proposals have a fundamental disadvantage: there is no support for regional Parliaments in Yorkshire, Cornwall, London, and so on. Their scenario will not materialise because the rest of Britain does not want it. Furthermore, Mr. Bob McCreadie of the Liberal Democrats has served only to undermine their position by his encouragement of independence—another example of those who believe that devolution would be but a first step towards independence.<br><br>
I have not had much opportunity to say much about the Scottish National party. In some mysterious way, it likes to give the impression that Scotland is being done down. What are the facts? For every £100 spent on every person resident in England, let us consider how much is spent per head of population in Scotland. The comparative figures for Scotland are: agriculture and fisheries, £255; trade and industry, £178; transport, £134; housing, for which I am responsible, £160; education, £136; and health, £128.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sillars</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If all this largesse is pouring down on us, why has the housing convenor in Glasgow said that, under present investment levels, it will take 300 years to cure the dampness problems?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0024">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 37</span>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can tell the hon. Gentleman that if the housing convenor in Glasgow processed council house sales more quickly, it would ease the pressure on the public sector housing stock. The hon. Gentleman once said that he would abolish Scottish Homes. That would do a fundamental disservice to Scotland and well he knows it.<br><br>
I am proud to be Scottish and I am proud to be British; I have no desire to choose between the two. Indeed, I believe that separation and the creation of 50 Scottish embassies and a separate army, navy and air force would be incredibly expensive. The people of Scotland do not want that.<br><br>
For every £4 of identifiable public expenditure in England, the Chancellor of the Exchequer disburses £5 in Scotland. Moreover, Scotland contributes 7·6 per cent. of income tax paid by United Kingdom residents and receives 10·5 per cent. of identifiable public expenditure in return. In 1990–91 Scotland received £2·5 billion more than it would have received on the basis of United Kingdom average identifiable public expenditure. I remind hon. Members that £2·5 billion is more than twice the entire revenue received from North sea oil in 1991–92.<br><br>
We will have no truck with proposals for a tax-raising Scottish Parliament, which could lead to the break up of the Union. In 1926, the Tory Government made certain that the Secretary of State for Scotland would have a Cabinet position. In 1939, a Conservative Government moved the Scottish Office to St. Andrew's house in Edinburgh. My right hon. Friend the Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) gave the Scottish Grand Committee the opportunity to debate issues in Edinburgh not long ago—<i>[Laughter.]</i> Hon. Members see the humour of it. There is an on-going process. Universities have been brought under the control of the Scottish Office, as has Scottish Natural Heritage, in which I played a small role.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is obvious from the tone of the hon. Gentleman's speech that Winston Churchill is one of his great heros. Does he agree with Winston Churchill who said in Edinburgh in 1951 that it cannot be right for the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 38</span>
evils of socialism to be imposed on the people of Scotland by a majority at Westminster? In view of the case that he is making now, why did he stand in 1974 on a manifesto that advocated the establishment of a Scottish Parliament?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In 1974 we did not support the creation of a separate Scottish Executive. The original Douglas-Home proposals are not on offer now. Of course I admire Sir Winston Churchill. He was a great Prime Minister and for years he knew what it was like to be in the wilderness. On the mandate question, if we accept the argument of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton), the nationalisation of shipbuilding would never have been passed by Parliament. The majority of English Members of Parliament were against nationalising shipbuilding, but the Scottish Labour majority swung the balance. None of the Opposition Members objected to that Act being passed. They cannot have it both ways.<br><br>
We are always receptive to new proposals, but they must improve the nature and workings of the United Kingdom Parliament. We consider these matters on that premise. Scotland is a nation of cultural diversity and excellence. Let us remember our common heritage with the rest of the United Kingdom. Let us maintain and strengthen our links, not throw away the benefits of 300 years of unity.<br><br>
The Scottish National party is always harping on about North sea oil. That is not the golden egg that we are led to believe it is. Oil is a high-cost fuel and that source will not exist for ever. Even if Scotland were independent, there are doubts about what oil could be claimed as Scottish. Under article 6 of the Geneva convention, any dispute would have to go to the Court of Justice at The Hague. These matters cannot be dealth with simply. I strongly support the Union.</span></p>

<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee has considered the matter of the constitutional implications for Scotland of a Scottish Parliament.</p></blockquote></p>
