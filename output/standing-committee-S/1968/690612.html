	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before calling the Minister, I should like to say a few words. The Committee has been going well, but there has been a tendency for hon. Members to go just a little wide of the Amendments. I do not want to be a difficult Chairman, but where this happens I shall not allow a debate on the Question, "That the Clause stand part of the Bill". With co-operation and if Members confine themselves to the Amendment under discussion, I am sure that we shall make even better progress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Dr. J. Dickson Mabon)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My closing words on Tuesday morning were:
	<br><blockquote><p>"So we are talking about an asset which is no longer an asset".—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 10th June, 1969; 	<i>c.</i> 156.]</p></blockquote>
I was replying to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith), but not referring to him personally. I was taking of the position of owner-occupiers and others who would be involved in these supplementary payments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's basic contention, which must be recognised as an important point of principle, is expressed in paragraphs 21 and 22 of the White Paper. Special consideration should be given to certain owner-occupiers because they have often committed their life savings to a property at a time of housing shortage. Some of these young couples get rehoused by a local authority, but they lose completely the purchase price of the tenement single end, or room and kitchen. If they were to get an appreciable supplementary payment, it might often be the
	<span class='label label-info column'>158</span>
deposit on buying a house and I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would favour that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But would it not be right and proper to extend this provision to commercial undertakings, and landlords are engaged in a business. As the hon. Member for Hillhead reminds me constantly, houses to rent ought to be run as a business and recognised as a business, not a bad business, but a good business providing a service. That being so, it would be an unusual principle in British law to seek to compensate the owner of a business for the deterioration of an asset.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1955, the Conservative Government introduced a special supplement in England for this limited purpose, but, for reasons which escape me, this was not done in Scotland. The best thing done in Scotland in this respect was in 1959 when the Conservative Government, again with this restriction to an owner-occupier, said that the minimum they would give would be the gross annual value of his house. Those of us who recollect the days before the 1961 revaluation will remember how small were valuations of houses at that time. They represented nothing like the purchase price even of a single end or a room and kitchen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put it to the hon. Gentleman that we cannot extend the provision in the Bill. His Government would not do so and I do not see why the present Government should take any further steps along that road.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. G. D. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely unhappy about what the Minister has said. He talks about an asset which is no longer an asset, but it is an asset and he knows perfectly well that it is an asset. It ceases to be an asset only because the authorities say that it is not an asset, that it may not be lived in and does not reach the tolerable standard. But it is an asset and that is recognised by the Bill's provisions to allow owner-occupiers to obtain compensation, which the Minister calls supplementary payment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the right principle. If the community decides, by legislation, to take away the value of a house, or anything else, the community ought to compensate the individual. It is to compensate the owner-occupier but not the landlord, because his is a commercial undertaking. This is the most extraordinary argument I have ever heard from the Minister, and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1232">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>159</span>
I have heard some extraordinary arguments from him. He assumes that the landlord is a great company, but the landlord may be the proverbial widow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are plenty of small people whose property has fallen into a derelict condition only because of the action of past Governments. Under the Rent Acts the individual landlord has been hit by rent restriction which has prevented him from maintaining his property in proper condition. Now, although the owner-occupier is to get compensation, the landlord will get only site value. That is wrong and I urge my hon. Friends to stick to their guns with this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister of State for his explanation on Tuesday and for giving further clarification this morning on this matter of compensation. However, I am not entirely happy with what he has said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I read this provision originally to see what was the purpose of this extra payment, I felt that where it included an element of disturbance, or that kind of thing, it obviously applied specifically to the occupier rather than to the landlord.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 36, in page 12, line 37, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>(3) Where an interest in a house purchased or vacated as described in subsection (1) of this section was acquired by any person (in this subsection referred to as the first owner) on or after 1st August 1968 and less than two years before the relevant date, and a payment under the said subsection (1) in respect of that interest would have fallen to be made by the authority concerned had the qualifying period been a period beginning with the acquisition and ending with the relevant date, the authority concerned shall make to the person who was entitled to the interest at the date when the house was purchased or vacated a payment of the like amount, if—
	<ol>	<li>the authority are satisfied that before acquiring the interest the first owner</li></ol></p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>160</span>
	<p>I have since read the relevant sections of the White Paper on which the Minister has based his argument.</p>
	<p>I do not know whether the Minister is prepared to take another look at this question. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith) is absolutely correct when he says that landlords include not just commercial undertakings, but the many individuals who may own one or two houses. In terms of fairness and equity, even if one accepted the Minister's argument, which I do not in principle, and wanted to exclude large undertakings, a considerable number of smaller people will be treated invidiously by comparison with owner-occupiers and others who have been in occupation for the qualifying period.</p>
	<p>If the Minister is not prepared to take another look at this matter, particularly in relation to these smaller landlords among whom there could be hardship and invidious comparisons, I advise my hon. Friends to support the Amendment.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the Amendment be made:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 8, Noes 10.</p>
	<p>had made all reasonable inquiries to ascertain whether it was likely that the notice, resolution or order, by reference to which the relevant date is defined in section 21(1) of this Act would be served, passed or made within two years of the acquisition and that he had no reason to believe that it was likely; and</p>
	<p>the person entitled to the interest at the date when the house was purchased or vacated was the first owner or a member of his family.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the same time we shall take the following Amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 37, in Clause 19, page 13, line 22, leave out from "circumstances" to end of line 25.</p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1233">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>161</span>
	<p>No. 38, in page 12, line 38, leave out Clause 19.</p>
	<p>No. 39, in Clause 20, page 13, line 38, leave out "or 19".</p>
	<p>No. 40, in Clause 21, page 14, line 1, leave out "sections 18 and 19" and insert "section 18".</p>
	<p>No. 41, in Clause 21, page 14, line 24, leave out "to 20" and insert "and 19".</p>
	<p>No. 44, in Clause 21, page 14, line 38, leave out "sections 18 and 19" and insert "section 18".</p>
	<p>No. 45, in Clause 24, page 16, line 9, leave out "18 or 19" and insert "or 18".</p>
	<p>No. 89, in Schedule 6, page 55, line 35, leave out "or 19".</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendments Nos. 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 44, 45 and 89, are Government Amendments to replace Clause 19 which deals with discretionary payments to certain owner-occupiers. Amendment No. 36 inserts a new subsection in Clause 18 in place of Clause 19. The other Amendments replace the references to Clause 19 in Part I and Schedule 6. A similar adjustment was made in the Committee Stage of the Bill concerning England and Wales. We have had discussions with my colleagues and we feel that this adjustment ought to be made in the Scottish Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. J. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Bruce-Gardyne) objects, I am certainly willing to listen to the arguments, but it would surprise me if he took exception to this. The effect of the Amendments is not to leave to their discretion but to make it mandatory on local authorities to pay the full amount of the supplement in every case where they are satisfied that an owner-occupier, although he has not completed the two year period, made "all reasonable inquiries" before he bought the house about the likelihood of local authority action and had no reason to believe that it was likely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A local authority would be left with no discretion as to the amount of the payment. I hope that the hon. Member for South Angus, like all my hon. Friends, will want owner-occupiers to be given this preference, rather than to leave it to the discretion of the local authority. If the authority is satisfied that the owner-occupier bought the house in the well-founded belief that he could stay in it for at least two years, he should be en-
	<span class='label label-info column'>162</span>
titled to the supplement in full.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister of State is getting over-excited about a mild interjection of mine. It is just that we have noticed so frequently in recent months that the present incumbents of the Scottish Office have slavishly to follow the English pattern. It may be that there is a good reason for doing it in this case, but we have seen it so often in the past.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed in the hon. Gentleman. He is an intelligent man and yet he constantly comes up with propaganda parrot cries that are the enemy of reason and rationality. There is nothing wrong with following provisions in an English Measure if they are good. There is everything wrong with following them if they are bad. It is absolutely right, too, as we demonstrated to the English yesterday, that if there is something good for England and it can be put in a Scottish Bill, it should be put in a Scottish Bill. I wish we could get away from this kind of crypto-nationalistic idea that there is something essentially bad about the English. It is a nonsense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The English Bill at least has the advantage of being ahead in Parliamentary debate. It has entered its Report stage and English hon. Members have had the advantage of a great deal of time for their Bill as we have not. It is only right that I should intelligently anticipate as much as I can of those discussions. I am sorry the hon. Gentleman takes exception to that. I hope that his colleagues will speak to him afterwards and remind him that it is not a good thing to make interjections as he does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having dealt with the hon. Member's anti-English slavishness, may I ask him to use his intelligence, of which he has a great deal, to consider whether this is a good move. I suggest to the Committee that it is a good thing to make it mandatory upon an authority to pay the full amount of the supplement in every case where it is satisfied on the consequent conditions. I hope that the Opposition will welcome the Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for South Angus (Mr. Bruce-Gardyne) is right to say that we do not want to follow English legislation slavishly. We ought to question it, and it is a credit to my hon. Friend's questioning and inquiring mind, to which the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1234">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>163</span>
Minister might have paid tribute, that he intervened as he did. The Opposition value the assistance that my hon. Friend gives us in these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the proposal to make it mandatory on a local authority to make sure that payment is made in these cases. However, I foresee that certain difficulties might arise under paragraph (	<i>a</i>) which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the authority are satisfied that before acquiring the interest the first owner had made all reasonable inquiries to ascertain whether it was likely".</p></blockquote>
This obviously gives certain discretion to a local authority to decide whether an owner has done his homework properly and made certain. If a local authority wanted to be hard-hearted, it could say that a person had not made sufficient inquiries. I trust that this subsection will be interpreted reasonably and sensibly with a certain leniency, because all the good that the Minister of State is trying to do could be spoiled if a local authority decided to be awkward and difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, while we welcome this change, I hope that it will be sensibly interpreted and sensibly used. It could certainly improve the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to. Question proposed,</i> That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I gave an adequate warning to hon. Members at the beginning of our Sitting that if they went wide on Amendments, I should not allow a debate on Clause stand part. It seemed to me that the discussion ranged over the whole Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. I should like to raise one or two points not raised on Amendments. If you examine what I have said on Amendments to the Clause, Mr. Robertson, you will find that I have confined my remarks to the Amendments in hand. I want to deal with certain questions raised by other Members and not answered at the time by the Minister for obvious reasons. It would be relevant to get the answers now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am reluctant to accede to the hon. Member's point of order, but as it is a lovely day and I feel in a good mood, I shall call him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for
	<span class='label label-info column'>164</span>
your generosity, Mr. Robertson, and I shall respond to it by keeping strictly and briefly to the points I want to raise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Central (Mr. Tom McMillan) raised these issues as a result of representations made to him by Glasgow Corporation. The onus is to be on a local authority to seek out recipients of these claims. Local authorities, particularly Glasgow, say that this could put an administrative burden on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister of State think it right that the onus should be put on them? Secondly, when a closing or demolition order is served, could the person upon whom it is served be made aware of his rights to claim compensation? Thirdly, what time limit will there be for the submission of such claims for compensation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Adam Hunter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope you will extend the same generosity to me, Mr. Robertson. I am concerned with what may be a unique case. It concerns a widow, not the proverbial one, who lives in my constituency and who asked me some time ago to find out whether she was entitled to any of the supplementary benefits of the Bill. The last Amendment to the Clause might help her and I should like my hon. Friend to confirm that it would.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This woman had an uncle who had a house which he bequeathed to her. Unfortunately, a closing order was put on the house just before he died. Subsequent inquiries by this woman to the local authority have revealed that the authority feels that she is not entitled to it. I feel that under the Clause as amended she is. Will my hon. Friend tell me whether this woman, who did not take up the house before the closing order went on, would be considered the owner of this house?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is always difficult in Committee, as my hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline Burghs (Mr. Adam Hunter) will recognise, to comment on particular cases without full details, but at first sight I would say, "No." I do not think that she would be better off. However, it would be wise if I looked into the case in the light of the Bill and gave a more definite answer to my hon. Friend once I have had time to examine the case in detail. The Bill will not authorise the payment of money or deal with anything else until it receives the Royal Assent and then it will go back to only 1st
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1235">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>165</span>
August, 1968. I did not follow all the points my hon. Friend made about the timing. However, I make that general comment for the benefit of all hon. Members trying to make an assessment of these provisions in relation to their own constituencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that I had answered the questions raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Central (Mr. Tom McMillan), but one was repeated. I answered the 700 houses question. Claims will be made as a result of the notices served, and those notices will make arrangements for the method of making claims.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all know that in Glasgow it is often difficult to find someone on whom to serve a notice, but there are procedures, which we have discussed before, whereby we can demolish a property, or do whatever is required, after having given due notice, even though literally we have not found the owner. But I shall not go into that at this moment. There is no time limit on this matter, so the possibility of a notice being time-expired does not arise. A claim remains extant until the owner, or whoever is concerned, comes along.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Small</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Paragraph (	<i>b</i>) of Amendment No. 36 refers to the first owner or a member of his family. Does that mean a member of the family in occupancy of the house at a fixed date? Does it include unmarried members of the family, or married members of the family having an interest in it? I have experienced queries about inheritance when the oldest unmarried member of the family not in occupancy at the time had an interest in the house.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>PROVISIONS AS TO HOUSE SUBJECT TO HERITABLE SECURITY OR PURCHASED BY INSTALMENTS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Amendment No. 39 made,</i> in page 13, line 38, leave out "or 19".—[	<i>Dr. Dickson Mabon.</i>]</p>
	<p>11.0 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important Clause because it deals with the adjustment of outstanding mortgages, which has in the past given trouble. I have a specific point to raise here which I ask the Minister to bear in mind. Local authorities have operated house purchase loan schemes normally in those sectors of housing which are not covered by building societies. That is one of the reasons why the Government have asked local authorities to take on the operation. As a result, local authorities have helped people in the purchase of property in such instances, but where they have done it the local authorities have themselves frequently, in the end, become the heritable creditors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point I make in this connection is that these houses, even if in some cases they do not fall below the tolerable standard under the Bill, are precisely of the type on which the local authority has lent money, and particularly by the type of house which is ripe for inclusion in a treatment area. Under the Bill, one would find that the heritable security would be written down. In such circumstances, will the local autho-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1236">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>167</span>
rity suffer when it has become the heritable creditor over these properties? Will it suffer in any way when the properties are written down, and will any loss on the local authority's heritable security be met by a grant from the Exchequer? How will that point be dealt with?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have nothing against the provisions in this Clause, but these points have been put to me by a local authority, and it would be helpful if the Minister could clarify the matter for the benefit of those concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is that a local authority will suffer if it has entered into such an arrangement. It has in its judgment, decided that it will help someone to buy a property which may have a very brief life. If that is so, and the property goes, it will, like any other heritable creditor, have to accept the consequences of Section 18 of the 1967 Act, which this Clause applies, without prejudice to the previous discretion. There is no grant, either. I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman—perhaps he does not mean it himself—asks for it. A local authority has occasionally to face the fact that its decisions are its decisions, it must accept the responsibility and the consequences of decisions like that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Authorities, on the whole, as far as I am aware, have not pressed us on this question. I do not know which authorities have asked the hon. Gentleman to do so, but it surprises me that authorities are wanting it done. In my opinion, it is another form of always coming to the Government to bail them out for decisions which they have made, which the Government may or may not have agreed with but which it is their full entitlement to make. If they make good decisions, the Government wishes them good luck, in which case there is no need to fear; if they make bad decisions, it is their responsibility, and I do not think that the taxpayer should have to step in and help the ratepayers' elected representatives who have made an error.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that that will not give much consolation to those who prompted this short debate. I am sorry that I cannot go any further. Authorities should, in general, not lend on houses which they are to condemn in the reasonably near future, on which they will lose money. It is a silly policy, in my view. I recognise, how-
	<span class='label label-info column'>168</span>
ever, that there has to be a balance struck between the time for which the houses are in existence and the need of families to move into even inadequate accommodation. There has to be that balance struck. The discretion has to be exercised by the local authority, and the penalty for making a mistake in discretion is to suffer a monetary loss.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Small</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the Minister, and I am really astounded at the claim which has been made. I do not know of any local authority—I have reasonable experience in these matters—which has advanced money to anyone to buy a house unless there has been a certificate of fitness obtainable at the time justifying the advance made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point was put to us by Glasgow Corporation. While I accept what the Minister has said, he must bear in mind that there is a reason behind this submission. Glasgow Corporation feels that local authorities have been asked to operate purchase schemes in the sectors of housing which are not normally those in which the normal building societies operate. That is the point which is made, and that is why they have, rightly or wrongly, raised the question. I have raised it for the sake of the local authority concerned, which is interested and wants to know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the Minister for clarifying the matter. After all, one of our jobs is to make sure that representations and submissions raised by local authorities are aired in this Committee. That was my purpose, and I am grateful to the Minister for answering the question, even though not necessarily to the authority's satisfaction. None of us is satisfied all the time—it would be an ideal world if we were—but that does not mean that one is wrong in raising points in order to have them clarified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Member tell me whether he favours 100 per cent. grants or whether he accepts that it is right that, when discretion is exercised, there should not be a grant?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that I accepted the Minister of State's argument on this.

But I raised the point in this debate in order to clarify precisely what the thinking was, and to save the time of moving a specific Amendment. I thought that that was the more helpful and easier way to do it. I trust that the Minister of State accepts that as the spirit in which it was done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

wedding, and I was sorry not to have the chance to be here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are two straightforward Amendments. All I am concerned to do is to tighten up the Clause a little. To take Amendment No. 99 first, I am not certain that the word "execute" is the same as my suggested wording, "complete the execution of." It may well be that, under such a notice a person can start to repair work within the period laid down in the notice but not complete it. In that case, he may be assumed to be in the process of executing the work. I should like to make it absolutely precise by putting in the words, "complete the execution of".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Next, on the question of timing, the local authority may serve a notice giving a landlord or an owner a certain time, not less than 21 days, in which to complete the repairs. I feel that, as well as this minimum time, there ought to be a maximum time laid down. I think that one year is reasonable to allow for very substantial repair work. It is probably over-generous, but I think that some maximum should be put in. I should like to hear the Minister's views on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of Amendment No. 99, has been achieved without these additional words. I recognise that the hon. Gentleman's purpose is to ensure that the works specified in the notice are not only commenced within the time specified, but are also completed. But if the hon. Gentleman will pause for a moment, he will see that if, let us say, the notice required a roof to be repaired and plaster work, internally or externally, to be carried out, it is quite possible that the roof will have been repaired but the plaster work will not have been done. The subsection as drafted already achieves his object. If the works specified have not been completed, they have not been executed. I give that example. The works specified have not been executed, but at least they have been begun. That is the relevant point, that they should be in progress. It would be wrong to put in, "complete the execution of", although that is our intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 98 alarms me a little, knowing the habits of some, admittedly a minority, of local authorities. It is
	<span class='label label-info column'>172</span>
understandable to want a maximum, but often the maximum becomes the norm, and, even if we had to have a maximum, I certainly could not agree to its being a year. That is too long. I prefer to leave it open so that we can encourage local authorities to think in short terms, certainly not in terms of a year, for this work to be carried out. There is no quarrel here over the minimum period of 21 days. That is reasonable in the circumstance, and no one questions that, but I should much prefer that we did not have a maximum stated. Let us be fair about it. It could involve a minor affair, which would be annoying if not done promptly, within a month or so. I accept that. But, on the other hand, it might involve the complete re-slating of a roof, which could take quite a long time; and it would be unreasonable to make a guess that it would be three months, eight months, or four months. Certainly, it should not be a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the hon. Gentleman not to press for a maximum limit but to leave it to the discretion of the authorities, buttressed, I would hope, by active Members of Parliament, councillors and Ministers making sure that local authorities are not dilatory in these things.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take up one point made by the hon. Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles (Mr. David Steel) on the question of the time, and I support what the Minister has said. It is important that a reasonable period should be given, but a maximum could be very awkward. However, I hope that local authorities will be reasonable, particularly in country areas. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman has this in mind. In country areas, it is not always easy to get tradesmen to come and do jobs quickly. There is a limited number of firms available, and in the remoter areas this can be a genuine problem for someone who has to have his house repaired. If there has been a lot of work going on locally, there can be difficulty in arranging for routine work and repairs if the required period is too short. Obviously, this is something to be taken into account; local authorities in rural areas will bear it very much in mind. I hope that in any instructions which go out from the Scottish Office about the working of the Bill emphasis will be laid on this point, particularly in rural areas where tradesmen
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1239">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>173</span>
are difficult to come by quickly. A lot of common sense and reasonableness will have to be exercised by the local authority in this respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to press the Amendments. I am not entirely happy about the Minister's reply and I think that his logic is a bit peculiar when he says that, if one wrote in a maximum time, some authorities might be dilatory and, therefore, one should not put in a maximum time at all. That seems to give them more elbow room to be even more dilatory. But, on this occasion, I accept his optimism that a bit of encouragement may cause them to use reasonable time limits and they will not delay serious repairs or give notices allowing vast lengths of time in which work may be carried out. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 47, in page 16, line 25, leave out "(	<i>b</i>) stating that", and insert "being works which".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suggest that it would be convenient to take Amendment No. 48 at the same time, in page 16, line 26, leave out "those works".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Robertson. These are really drafting Amendments, To our way of thinking, they would make the Clause plainer and simpler. If they were accepted, starting from (	<i>a</i>) the subsection would then read, read,
	<br><blockquote><p>"requiring him, within such reasonable time, not being less than 21 days, as may be specified in the notice, to execute the works specified in the notice, being works which, in the opinion of the local authority, will bring the house up to such a standard …"</p></blockquote>
We think that this simplifies it a little and makes the whole subsection easier to understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that there may be a criticism from the Minister that this is not just a simple matter of drafting, in that, as the subsection is at present drawn, the local authority has two definite requirements laid upon it. First, the local authority requiries the person responsible for the house requiring repair to execute the works, and then, secondly it goes on to say that it must state, "in the opinion of the local authority", what those works are which will bring the house up to
	<span class='label label-info column'>174</span>
"such a standard of repair". Therefore, I can see that we are putting into one process what presently is in two steps. However, we on this side do not think that those two specific steps are necessary. Our Amendment would put it into one step, without destroying the meaning. If the local authority requires works to be carried out, presumably, they will be works to bring the house up to a standard. In any case, the local authority will behave sensibly and properly, and it should not be necessary for the authority specifically to state, as a separate step altogether, that, in its opinion, the works will bring the house up to the standard of repair which it wishes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment is not one of great substance, but we think that it clarifies the subsection without necessarily giving the local authority less responsibility for justifying what it requires to be done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have to disagree with the hon. Gentleman about the effect of these two Amendments. We are all agreed that it is important that the work should be done, and it is certainly important that both the local authority and the owner or person responsible know that the work has been done. If we insert the words "being works which" and take out "stating that", we shall destroy the precision of the subsection as it stands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will remember that this Clause repeals Section 11 of the Housing (Scotland) Act, 1966. The words which we have used here are, in fact, time-tested words from Section 11, which tries to ensure—I think that it does it successfully—that the recipient of a repair notice knows exactly what he has to do and is left in no doubt that, if he does it, he protects himself against any other such notice in the near future. If we made these Amendments, not only should we make unsure what had to be done in the mind of the person concerned, but, even if he were to do certain works, he would not be quite secure that he had done enough to ensure that he would not get another notice. I cannot think of a more unsatisfactory situation: the local authority is unhappy about whether the work is being done, and the person concerned is unsure that, having done the work, it will meet the situation. I think it is important to get this right, and it is important to let the person know that, if he plays the game and does certain
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1240">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>175</span>
precise things, he will no. have another notice served on him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appeal to the hon. Gentleman not to remove both legs of the Clause here, and particularly the second one—the first one, because of the question of ambiguity, and the second one, because the poor soul who has the notice served on him cannot be sure that the process will not go on and on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister of State for what he has said. In introducing this Amendment, in a drafting sense, we did not want to change the general meaning of the Clause. In the interests of progress, I accept what the hon. Gentleman says, that it might weaken the intention. We do not wish in any way to do that, so, in the circumstances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 49, in page 16, line 28, at end insert "estimated life".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In all our discussions about standards, whether tolerable standards or other standards, it is easy to argue about what we, as individuals, think are the right standards or the correct criteria to include. Obviously, there is a considerable conflict whenever standards are drawn up, on the one hand, trying to make them as objective as possible for easy interpretation, so that they do not give rise to argument later on, and yet, on the other hand, trying to achieve a certain element of concision, without introducing too many extraneous ideas of one sort or another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it appears to us that in relation to this question of repairs, as in relation to the question of what standards are necessary, there could be an element of conflict between the person whose house is in disrepair and the local authority about what constitutes disrepair and what considerations the local authority ought to take into account. We have no quarrel with the standards that are raised in subsection (1)(	<i>b</i>), having regard to the age, character and location, and disregarding internal decorative repair which is not a structural matter. However, if we are to be prudent in applying this Clause in relation to repairs, it is important to include consideration of the estimated life of the house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>176</span>
The Minister of State may argue that, because age is taken into account, that point is already covered. Frankly, I do not think that it is covered. Age is an historical fact from the past; it does not necessarily relate to the future life of the house. Some of our very old houses are substantially built and have a considerably greater expectancy of life than houses built much more recently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We feel, therefore, that it will help the interpretation of this subsection if, in addition to the criterion of age, we include also the criterion of the estimated life of the building as justifying repair being carried out. It helps to clarify the Clause, making it less likely to raise problems and arguments when the Bill has to be applied. For these reasons—it is an entirely practical point—I hope that the Minister of State will accept the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I strongly support this sensible Amendment. As my hon. Friend points out, age really has nothing to do with it. A building like, for instance, Edinburgh Castle will have a longer life ahead of it than council houses built in 1920, many of which may now be reaching the stage of becoming rather tottery. I ask the Minister very seriously to consider this legitimate request. It would make a considerable improvement to this part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This Amendment would add a new factor, that is to say, the estimated future life of a house, to the factors which determine what is a reasonable standard of repair. At present, the standard of repair with which a local authority can require a house to comply must have regard to its age, to its character and to its location. These are all factors which we can readily judge by an inspection of the house and factors which are commonly taken into account in other contexts, for example, Section 27 of the Rent Act, 1965, where we have an assessment of fair rent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Estimated life, I think the Committee will agree, is a much more uncertain factor than any of the three I have mentioned, as it depends on a number of unknowns. For example, there is the future maintenance of the property. Many a property would have a long life if it were properly maintained, and even the best
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1241">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>177</span>
of properties could have a short life if they were badly neglected. Sadly, we have evidence of that all over the country, and certainly in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another point is that the future demand for housing in an area could well affect the life of a property. I shall not develop this argument, but hon. Members will recognise that, even when a house has a little longer to last, it is often more sensible to remove the property, and this happens in the private as well as the public sector, in order to develop the area and provide longer life housing, perhaps of a higher density, or perhaps of a higher standard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These two points make a judgment of estimated life difficult. There is no difficulty about age. I do not think there is any difficulty, in practice, about character or about location. But to add this new factor with these uncertainties is making it very difficult, and I do not think that it would be satisfactory. Relating the standard of repairs to the circumstances of the house as it exists is satisfactory and we should keep it like that rather than assume that we know what the future maintenance will be and what the future housing demand will be as it may affect the estimated life.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like the Minister to think about this further and I support the Amendment. A local authority may have it at the back of its mind to create a housing clearance area. If a house in that area were in serious disrepair, it might well be that if it were not in the back of the authority's mind to make it a clearance area, it would require more substantial repairs to the house to take into account that the house might be used for another 10 or 20 years. But if it thought that in future planning it was likely that within the next four or five years it was going to demolish the property in any case, it might say that all it was interested in was putting the house in a safe and sound condition, which might not be of quite so high a standard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this situation the estimated life of the house is important in relation to the local authority's own planning. Perhaps the Minister will look at this point again before Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister produced the most bogus and invalid argument possible when he talked about the hypothetical assessment of the future life
	<span class='label label-info column'>178</span>
of a house being entirely based upon the standard to which it is maintained. Obviously, when one is assessing the life of a building, one assumes that the building is to be maintained in reasonable order. That is the sort of yardstick one can adopt. Obviously, even a brand new house, if it is completely neglected from the day it is built, will have a shorter life. One must obviously measure in terms of the belief that the house will be reasonably well maintained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an absolutely crucial criterion. I hope that the Minister will not completely close his mind to this suggestion and that even if he will not be forthcoming about it today, he will think about it seriously later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members opposite are making heavy weather of this. When one has not a good case, one uses exaggerated language. To suggest, as the noble lord the Member for Edinburgh, North (Earl of Dalkeith) does, that this Amendment is absolutely crucial to the Bill is stretching it. Local authorities have all sorts of things at the back of their minds: the trouble is that they sometimes stay there too long. The same local authority may serve an order on an owner or factor and, in common sense, without trying to get involved in estimating the life of a property, the authority would take it into account before serving an order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about property which by and large is pretty dilapidated and possibly previously the subject of some kind of action to bring it up to a tolerable standard, in other words, not the kind of house where the owner or the factor is unaware of all that is going on. Most of the trouble is caused to Glasgow by properties where the council cannot find the owner. In these circumstances, the authority will not spend money which it is not to get back.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When an authority has to be pressed to carry out repairs because of the default of the owner or the factor, to say that it may throw money away indiscriminately, without assessing it to the best of its knowledge and in accordance with the age, character and location of the house, is stretching matters. Some of the Amendments moved by the Opposition have had much to commend them, but I do not think that this is "absolutely crucial"or a burning issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed that we do not have the support of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Hugh D. Brown). It has been greatly encouraging to us to have his support on other Amendments. It has added weight and strength to our arguments. I am sorry that on this occasion he is not prepared to support us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North (Earl of Dalkeith) that this is a matter of importance and that the Amendment improves the Clause. I support the hon. Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles (Mr. David Steel). When a house is within a housing treatment area, or likely to come within a housing treatment area, the house itself may be in perfectly good order, but if it is likely to come down within the reasonably near future and the local authority knows it, it is obvious that the criterion should be the estimated life of the house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State based his argument mainly on the ground that the other criteria in the subsection were questions of historical facts, a point I made when I opened this debate. I accept that those questions are easy to decide. Repairs have to keep the house going in the future and whether repairs are needed is a question of historical fact, but whether they are justified depends on the future life of the house. To that extent it is important to introduce the future element as well as the historical element.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stress that repairs will be of different standards. The subsection says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"stating that, in the opinion of the local authority, those works will bring the house up to such a standard of repair as is reasonable".</p></blockquote>
There will obviously be different standards of repairs. "Reasonable" refers to "age character and location," and so on. Therefore, if these criteria are to decide the standard of repair, the estimated life of the building is equally important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles has said, if a house is likely to come down in the near future, because it is to come within a housing treatment area, the standard of repair, assuming that it must be repaired anyway in order to keep it in a habitable and proper condition for those living there, will vary in accordance with its estimated life. If the estimated life is another 20 or 30 years and a roof repair is required, it might be prudent for the house to be com-
	<span class='label label-info column'>180</span>
pletely stripped and a new roof and new slates put on. But if it is five to ten years and the house is to come down anyway because it is in a housing treatment area, a much simpler and lower standard of repair, equally effective for a short period, such as putting bitumastic felt on the roof, may be sufficient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the local authority will have to decide what standard of repair is necessary, and the standard of repair must be related directly to the estimated life of the house. This is the importance of the Amendment. I should like the Minister to have another look at it, because it is a matter of substance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What we are arguing about is whether we should add a provision which will, if anything, result in less repair being done because it is not necessary. Alternatively, should we keep the Clause as it stands and keep the risk that too much repair will be done?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Edinburgh Corporation has operated a provision like this. We are now debating the storm damage Clause. We need it because we did not have clear powers to oblige people to repair their properties. Fortunately, Edinburgh under its own local Act had this power and has sensibly used it, although it is not quite on all fours with this. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, North (Earl of Dalkeith) is in a better position than most to tell us whether it is the experience of landlords in Edinburgh that Edinburgh Corporation misuses its power in the sense that it requires repairs to be done when the estimated life of the house is rather short and repairs are a waste. That will be news to me, because in my experience of Edinburgh Corporation in its dealings with landlords, while it is conscientious about ensuring that repairs are done, it does not go to extravagant lengths.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I admit that that is the risk of the Clause. Edinburgh has not abused its powers. If I have to choose between an abuse of that kind and an abuse the other way round, which is what would happen if the Amendment were passed, I should prefer the former. With the abuse the other way round, the landlord could argue, "Why should I repair my house to this terrible standard which you are demanding? It is far too high. This house will not last that length of time. Please do not ask me to spend money on a property like this, because it is not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1243">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>181</span>
fair when you will knock it down in 10 years".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish I had the noble Lord's innocent belief that in Scotland we experience a minimal incidence of badly-repaired houses. In some parts it is true, but it is not true of the whole of Scotland. We have a country whose stock of houses, for one reason or another, is neglected and not properly repaired. That is true not of the majority of houses, but of a large number. There is already a situation which we must correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles (Mr. David Steel) ought not to support the Amendment. If we have to make an error—and I agree that it is a balance of judgment and the possibility of an error is endemic—let us choose the error of making too many repairs. There is a penalty for a local authority that is silly and asks landlords to repair their properties excessively. The penalty is that if, having obliged the landlord to spend money on his property, it later sweeps the property away, it has to compensate. If the landlord has kept the house up to a high standard of repair, the local authority is penalised for its foolishness.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We must not be definitive about this, because no one has given me evidence that Edinburgh or any other authority abuses this. We are arguing here 	<i>in vacuo;</i> nobody has come forward with this claim that local authorities do this. There is a fear that they may, I agree, but no one has demonstrated that they have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I am saying is that if we must choose between one or other, I should prefer to choose the one where, if the local authority is wrong, it is penalised by having to compensate. On the other
	<span class='label label-info column'>182</span>
hand, if we accept the Amendment, we do not have the same redress against landlords who fail to repair their properties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appeal to hon. Members to answer this simple question as Members of Parliament, irrespective of party; which happens more often in Scotland—a local authority recklessly requiring landlords to repair, or landlords failing to repair? If the answer is the latter, that the Clause is essential to the Bill and we must have the Bill for all Scotland, not just for bits of Scotland and principally Edinburgh, I ask the Committee not to make the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has this argument absolutely back to front. His view of the effect of the Amendment is exactly the opposite to mine. A local authority may decide to do nothing about enforcing the repairs to a house because it is so old when it ought to say, "Although this is an old house, it has a reasonable life ahead of it, and, therefore, repairs ought to be carried out". I foresee the effect of the Amendment as being more repairs and more, not less, enforcement upon the owners of buildings to make the necessary repairs. This would be a beneficial move, which is why I support the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know of many instances of local authorities tending to dismiss buildings because they are old and crumbling and not worth doing anything about, but in my view and in the judgment of many others these buildings are capable of many more years of useful service and should be included in this category. It is an important criterion because it will increase the range of buildings with which the local authorities can deal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not dissent from that. It is a perfectly sound argument. But if we do not include the Amendment, there will still be nothing in the Bill to preclude that exercise. Will the noble Lord address himself to the other side of the argument, the cart rather than the horse, and agree with me that there could be a defect in the Amendment in that landlords might not repair on the plea that the estimated life of the house was so short?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One could probably always argue about what the life of a house may be. It may be necessary to pro-

	<span class='label label-info column'>183</span>
duce some sort of arbitration machinery. It is something which any reasonable panel of architects could decide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stick to my point, that this would give the local authorities more power to use the strong arm of the law which we are providing for them to enforce repair on the owners of a great many houses, which at the moment they may get away with not repairing because they say they are so old—houses which could and should be modernised and brought up to better standards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my noble Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North (Earl of Dalkeith) in his argument on the positive case which he has advanced, as opposed to the negative case against which the Minister was arguing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was rather concerned by one of the arguments that the Minister of State used against the negative sense in which he chose to interpret the Amendment. He said that if the local authority required a landlord to undertake repairs and within a year or two the house were demolished, the ratepayer would have to pay higher compensation. What he has overlooked is that, certainly in areas like my own constituency where many landlords are people with a small number of properties from which they obtain a totally derisory rent, landlords will be in no position to provide the funds for the repairs which they are required to undertake out of their own resources. They may have to borrow the money and if they have to pay 10 per cent. or 12 per cent.—at the present rate of progress under the Government they may be paying 14 per cent.—on the money they have to borrow, they will not find that the increased compensation corrects their substantial financial loss.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not enough to say that the local authority—the ratepayers—will be penalised because they will have to pay higher capital compensation. There is also the problem of the landlord being put to heavy expenses incurred at a time when the cost of borrowing money will be at an all-time high rate. This is another argument against the negative side of the case which the Minister of State was trying to put.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee should welcome the Amendment, both on the positive grounds which my noble Friend advanced and
	<span class='label label-info column'>184</span>
on the negative grounds which the Minister tried to refute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's argument falls because it is not the landlord who would determine the estimated life of the house. The whole of his case in appealing to me not to support the Amendment was that it would be giving the wicked landlords an opportunity to say that the estimated life was not all that great and therefore they need not do the repairs. It is the local authorities who would determine the estimated life.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The landlord could appeal to the sheriff and say that the local authority had been unfair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an academic argument. It is highly unlikely. The Minister takes a rather curious view of the way people behave. Recourse to the courts in a case like this would be extremely unlikely. Certainly I am glad to see provision for it in the Bill, but I do not think much use will be made of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Member know that three landlords actually threatened to take us to court to prevent us from repairing storm-damaged roofs in Glasgow? We knew that we could not win the case and we did not go to court. One of them was a millionaire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the main points of the Minister's argument is that the absence of these words from Edinburgh's legislation does not affect the position there, that the situation there is good and the legislation works well. I am disappointed in him, because I have always regarded him as an optimist and an idealist. Just because something is good is no reason for not making it better. The Minister wants only to keep things at this one standard of good; we want to make them better still. Even if the situation in Edinburgh is good we want to make it better.

</div> <!-- division -->
	<p>12 noon.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 50, in page 17, line 12, leave out subsection (4).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had the unusual experience, having reached the fourth Sitting of the Committee, of having had all the Amendments which I have moved so far accepted by the Government. I fear that this record is likely to be broken now, because I start by saying that this is a probing Amendment and I recognise that the Government may not necessarily accept it, or, if they do, only because they wish to re-draft this subsection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulty about this subsection is that it is so imprecise. Earlier in the Clause is the term "a state of serious disrepair" and in this subsection there is the difference between a house being in a state of disrepair and being in a state of serious disrepair. None of this is related to the new concept of a tolerable standard, which we have accepted and which is one of the basic concepts of the Bill and a result of the Cullingworth Committee's Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, we should like an explanation from the Government of how this will be dealt with. I say straight away that the intention of this subsection is clear to me, and it seems to be a good one; that is to say, where a house may shortly get into a bad state, or where it is causing or likely to cause damage to a neighbouring house, or cause a neighbouring house to get into a bad state, one does not want to leave that to happen if preventive action could be taken. I understand that, but the terms are so imprecise that we need an explanation of how any disputes arising under the subsection are to be settled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that it is probably under this subsection that there may be more difficulty than the rest of the Clause. There is a procedure under Clause 28 for
	<span class='label label-info column'>186</span>
appeals which may be decided by the sheriff, but who is to judge what is a state of disrepair? There does not appear to be any definition relating to "state of disrepair" and "state of serious disrepair." We have a good set of criteria for "tolerable standard," but "state of disrepair" and "state of serious disrepair" are not, as far as I can see, precisely defined. While the intention is good, there may be difficulties unless it is clear what it is that is to be decided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sheriff, presumably, is mainly concerned with dealing with the rights of the individual and with legal matters. I cannot imagine that he can examine the state of the house and be the final arbiter on its precise state of repair in relation to the two conditions described in the subsection. How, therefore, will a dispute about the subsection be settled? Who is to be the final judge?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the sort of case that may arise will affect the rights of the individual. The individual may well be in favour of the repairs being done. He may be prepared to carry them out himself, as suggested, or the local authority may do them. But the time which is suggested to him may be thoroughly inconvenient to the occupants of the house. If major works have to be done and the occupants have to be moved out, the time given to them under subsection (1)(	<i>a</i>) could be most inconvenient. This is the sort of case which I foresee coming up to be settled under the appeals system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the hon. Gentleman give us some explanation of what is intended by these two terms? Will he consider looking at this subsection again to see whether it could be drafted more precisely, or whether definitions or clarifications could be added so that those who come to deal with these matters may see much more clearly what is involved? How will any differences of opinion about timing,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1246">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>187</span>
whether there are some repairs to be carried out or not, be settled, and who is to be the final judge?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend because I find this subsection remarkably distateful from the point of view of drafting. It says that where a local authority is of the opinion that a house in its district is not in a state of serious disrepair, it may deem it to be in a state of serious disrepair for the purposes of the Clause. That, leaving out a little of the verbiage, is what it says.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How on earth is the sheriff to adjudicate a case like this? The Government must take this subsection away to redraft it and make its purpose and point much clearer and much more precise. As it stands, the language is totally contradictory. I do not see how the sheriff can be expected to adjudicate under its terms. I hope that the Minister of State will heed my hon. Friend, take the subsection away, tidy it up, clean it up and produce it in a more respectable and presentable form on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that it is the drafting which is at fault. I am curious to know the reasons for the inclusion of this subsection which I regard as reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have received, as presumably all other Members did, submissions from the Chartered Land Societies' Committee of Scotland. By a curious coincidence, this is one of its suggestions. It seems odd to have received this submission when we are past what is probably one of the most important parts of the Bill. I do not know whether Members opposite have had advance notice of these submissions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome this provision. I do not think that it is a matter of interpretation. How does the sheriff interpret what is serious disrepair? He is as clueless as anybody else about it, although he could deal with legal points. It is a matter of common sense. Some sheriffs are not noted for their common sense, but is it suggested that adjudicating on repair is any more difficult than adjudication on serious disrepair?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that this provision is a result of local authorities asking for this power, but what are the reasons for it? It makes good sense to me. I have had personal experience of a good house, well above the tolerable standard, where regularly,
	<span class='label label-info column'>188</span>
in fact annually, a ceiling came down because of some minor disrepair in the roof that the owner or the factor had never attended to. This seems precisely the kind of situation that we want to catch up. The tenant or the occupier, or the local authority, must have some right, after examination, to compel the owner to eradicate not a serious disrepair but a minor repair which nevertheless is causing a lot of expense and inconvenience to the tenant or the occupier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to think that there are some local authorities which are so far advanced in their work that they have time to look at some of the minor disrepairs that could lead to serious deterioration. I hope that this is what is behind the thinking in this provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This provision is a substantial step forward in housing legislation in Scotland. The Government are anxious to include it and we have had a favourable response from local authorities about it. They think that they can use the Clause effectively and in a balanced way. In our consultations about the Bill we have had the comments of men well versed in this work, the Sanitary Inspectors' Association, to name only one, whose daily lives are concerned with adjudicating and advising on this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Hugh D. Brown) gave an excellent example of a minor defect which could lead to a serious disrepair. For example, a small disrepair to a roof, which could never be justified before the sheriff as a serious disrepair, by allowing rain penetration could damage plaster work, or, more seriously, affect the electrical wiring, or allow such rain penetration that it was a great inconvenience to the family concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We often talk about economic liberties, although the liberty of the landlord to do a great deal of what he wants on his own unfettered by the State, but what about the liberty of the tenants to get the proper return for the rent that they are paying in the form of accommodation which is without any disrepair, even minor disrepair? This is the purpose of this Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Gordon Campbell) has proposed some good Amendments when he and I have not disagreed about policy but have been interested only in method, I am open to be convinced that we can im-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1247">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>189</span>
prove methods and wording and so on, and he knows that. But if we disagree about policy, that is the end of the matter, no matter how well he devises Amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He described this as a probing Amendment. He does not deny the usefulness of the subsection, unlike his hon. Friend the Member for South Angus (Mr. Bruce-Gardyne) who questioned the usefulness of the subsection, but says that there is a case for preventive measures to avoid serious disrepair, and I agree with him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister must have misunderstood me entirely. I was not questioning the usefulness of the subsection. I can see the argument for having a provision of this kind, but I was saying that, as drafted, it is virtually incomprehensible and, I should have thought, quite unworkable on appeal to the sheriff.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One always makes a subjective judgment—there is no alternative—on wordings in statutes. All the advice we have is that this is a well phrased and well drafted subsection. As Old Bill said, "If you know of a better 'ole, go to it". I am perfectly willing to listen to a redrafting of subsection (4), but I have not had that, and that is not what we are debating. We are debating whether we should have the subsection at all. I do not see the point about the sheriff being in difficulty. I disagree with my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Hugh D. Brown) about the experience of sheriffs in this field. Sheriffs do not always arbitrate solely on intricate points of law. Sheriff courts take a good deal of this kind of process; they take evidence from experts, and they have to decide, under statute, having heard the common-sense reports of the technical men, whether the local authority is right in its assessment—that is, the wording of the Clause—in its opinion that a house in its district is in need of repair. The sheriffs do a very good job. They have been doing it since the Public Health Acts were instituted many years ago. I do not agree with my hon. Friend that sheriffs are bad at it; in fact, they are very good. I am only sorry that legislation in the past has not been as strong as it ought to have been to allow these cases more successfully to be arbitrated in the courts. The sheriff is the one who is the judge.

Another objection was raised regarding major works, when the whole family had to move out. Frankly, I do not see a major work coming under subsection (4). A broken gutter may cause damage to a wall, or even damage to a neighbour—what about a neighbour's rights?—all these are minor matters, and if it were a major matter it would qualify under serious disrepair. I am certain of that. While I am very willing to listen to later Amendments on Report about how subsection (4) might be better drafted, I cannot respond to the idea that we should drop it at this stage. We have spent a lot of time and thought on it, and I believe that we have got it right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I say finally that the response we have had from people all over Scotland, of different interests, some of them professional and technical, some of them elected members of local authorities, and some of them just ordinary folk who have had experience of these difficulties over repairs, is generally one of great welcome for a step forward in housing legislation in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reason for our putting down this Amendment is that it is usually a service to the Government if one can, on an Amendment, pinpoint a part of a Clause about which one has doubts. We could have raised the point in the main debate on the Clause, but it is usually convenient by a probing Amendment to draw attention to a particular provision about which one has doubts. It is convenient to both sides of the Committee because the Minister then realises that the matter will be raised and he does not have to deal with it at short notice on the Clause as a whole. I said at the outset that it was a probing Amendment. We recognise that one cannot just take the subsection out and not put something else in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the Minister has not answered my main point—which I shall pursue, with your permission, Mr. Robertson, in the main debate on the Clause—that is, the definition of a "state of serious disrepair" in subsection (1), which is what the sheriff will have to consider. Who is to decide what that definition is? In reply to this Amendment, the Minister simply read out bits—
	<br><blockquote><p>"they may deem it to be in a state of serious disrepair"</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1248">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>191</span>
and
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where a local authority are of the opinion that a house in -their district is in need of repair"</p></blockquote>
but all that comes back to the question of definition of a "state of serious disrepair" under subsection (1). However, I am happy to leave it to the Minister to explain all that in the next debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The example which I gave was of major repairs in the kind of situation in which a dispute might occur. I recognise that that will not be the general run of cases under this subsection, but I was just pointing to the sort of dispute which may arise, when it would be thoroughly inconvenient for the occupants of a house to have the repairs done at a certain time. That is the sort of case with which the sheriff will find himself having to deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are unhappy about the wording of this subsection. The Minister said that he is prepared to consider alternatives. It sounded as though he was expecting us to put forward the alternatives, and that is a challenge which I shall accept on behalf of my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) as well, who is an expert in drafting matters. We shall certainly have a shot to see whether we can improve it. But I hope that the Government also will give thought to it. As it is worded at the moment, the question of definition will provide problems, and it will create a sense of grievance if it is not clear to some of those who may be involved in disputes under this Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister of State suggested that we should find another "'ole" for him—I have always understood that that was the Government's job—I suggest that the simple solution is to take out this subsection and put the guts of it into subsection (1). immediately after the words "a state of serious disrepair". That is an 'ole which I offer to the Minister of State, and which I shall consider offering again on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, that is not a hole; it is a bottomless pit. It does not take us anywhere. It fails to take the point about preventive action, which the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn, to do him credit, seized on in his first speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Small</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot see anything wrong with the Clause as drafted. A local
	<span class='label label-info column'>192</span>
authority is not just bricks and lime and stone; it is a living organism. There is nobody probing and looking for this, that and the next thing. If a member of the local authority has a case drawn to his attention, he goes along to see the sanitary inspector and medical officer of health, as a matter of preventive care, and inquiries take place between members and officials as to the requirements. All we should do if we took this away would be to deprive ourselves of opportunity for a reasonable translation of the requirements obtaining in the community at the time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It looks as though there will be several suggestions on Report if my hon. Friend's fertile mind also is applied to an alternative. It is not a question of eliminating the concept of this subsection; it is a question of putting it in clearer terms and more workable terms. In the meantime, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I start straight away with the point to which I referred, the definition of "state of serious disrepair". I realise that there may be difficulties, but, as the Government put forward what we thought was a good set of criteria for a tolerable standard, and as this is something which must be made workable under the Bill, I ask the Minister how he thinks that the words in subsection (1),
	<br><blockquote><p>"in a state of serious disrepair"</p></blockquote>
will be interpreted. That is the first point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Second, I recognise that this is a Clause the need for which the storm damage episode, over a year ago, brought to light, and it will provide local authorities with powers, replacing those which they had before, to secure the repair of unfit houses, and at the same time it gives them much wider powers to deal with the sort of incidents and damage which occurred at the time of that hurricane in the Glasgow area and elsewhere in Scotland. I hope, therefore, that the Minister can say more now about how the Clause will help to deal with both the storm damage situation which still exists, particularly in Glasgow, and any future catastrophe of the same kind. We very much hope that it will not occur, but one must be ready
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1249">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>193</span>
for a gale of that kind and be able to deal with the consequences of it rapidly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gregor Mackenzie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, welcome this Clause. It will assist local authorities which are concerned about the problem of storm damage both now and in the future. I was particularly worried during the storm damage troubles by the problem of multiple ownership. This is why I was fairly keen that subsection (4) should remain. In my own area—this was pretty common throughout the West of Scotland—we found that, because of the problems of multiple ownership, someone on the top floor, for instance, either was not there or was not in a position to repair the house, and this affected the whole building. There is another problem I want to raise with my hon. Friend. It is essential that the factor concerned in a property of this kind should be made aware of his responsibilities in this regard. There can be a problem, where there are groups of small houses, when the factor does not have proper legal advice on his responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for South Angus (Mr. Bruce-Gardyne) and for Edinburgh, North (Earl of Dalkeith) made points about repairs Which I could not accept. With respect, the noble Lord's experience in Edinburgh is rather different from ours in the West of Scotland. We do not find owners quite so ready to make repairs as he does on the East coast. We also have the problem raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Hugh D. Brown) of properties being abandoned, and in great numbers. Also, in recent times, we have had considerable changes in ownership of property, companies passing their businesses over to men of straw, and so forth. The local authorities have had a lot of difficulty in that way. Change of ownership and abandonment of properties create a serious problem for us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My last point is about the rôle of the sheriff, the problem raised by the hon. Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles (Mr. David Steel). His experience of them is very different from ours among the large tenement blocks in the West of Scotland conurbations. We have found this the most serious problem of all. My hon. Friend the Minister made the point that there were owners who appealed against the decision of the local authority and took the matter to the sheriff. He cited three instances. In fact, in some parts of
	<span class='label label-info column'>194</span>
the West of Scotland this became a real racket. Under the old Act, when people were provided with certificates of disrepair and had to go to the sheriff's court, it took months and months for the cases to be heard. Eventually, when they did get to the sheriff's court, the sheriff either granted the application or made an order that repairs of some kind were to be effected. This is where I agree somewhat with the point raised by the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Gordon Campbell) about the definition of "serious disrepair". Because sheriffs granted some orders, small repairs were effected, and then, within a few weeks or a few months, the property fell into disrepair again because only the patchiest of work was done to satisfy the legal requirements. Then they came back to the sheriff, and the whole procedure started again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise not to quarrel with this Clause—I think that it is a good Clause—but to protest again about overlapping legislation. We have a good example of it here in this Clause, overlapping with the Town and Country Planning Bill, particularly in respect of the repairs notice Clause 50 and the compulsory acquisition Clause 49. I think it regrettable, in a way, that we have two Bills coming along at more or less the same time and seeking to achieve purposes which are very close to one another. I regard this Clause 25 as a good Clause, and I am sorry that it was not incorporated in the Town and Country Planning Bill, because it gives a slightly less drastic means of treatment for buildings of historic and architectural interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to know whether a local authority, when deciding what action to take on a building of architectural or historic interest, could, instead of going through the rather drastic treatment of following up a repairs notice with a compulsory purchase notice, go into the property, a listed building, and proceed under the terms of Clause 25. As far as I can see, there is nothing to stop this being applied to a listed building as a follow-up to action which could be taken under the repairs notice procedure of the Town and Country Planning Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am rather confused by these two bits of closely related legislation going through at more or less the same time. There would seem, on the face of it. to have been insufficient co-ordination be-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1250">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>195</span>
tween the various people who have been drawing up these Measures at the advisory stage. I did at one time suggest that it would be helpful to all of us if the Minister could somehow arrange for closer liaison—perhaps an introduction—between various departments within his own Department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to know whether the Clause could be used in respect of listed buildings of architectural and historic interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the noble Lord is in breach of a fundamental dialectical principle. All lemons are yellow, but not all yellow things are lemons. Historic houses are fortunate in that they are lemons; they are yellow, they are in the category of lemons, and, accordingly, they have this double treatment. I readily accept that if, for some reason, one wanted to improve a house which was a historic house or a listed building under Part V of the Bill we discussed last night, one could proceed under either of two headings—not both at the same time, I confirm that, but under either of two headings. I imagine—the noble Lord knows a great deal about this—that it would be an exceptional case in which one would want to proceed under this legislation, but there is nothing to debar proceeding under this legislation if that is the decision of the owner and the local authority is willing to go along with it. By the way, all the amenity societies, which did not write to us in the profusion that we wanted, would also allow one so to proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that that is perfectly legitimate. Of course, not all old houses have historic or architectural value, and in that case they are not treated under Part V; they must be treated under this Clause, and I think that that is right. I do not see anything wrong in having this distinction. If we put this part of the Bill into a Town and Country Planning Act, that would cause tremendous confusion of reference and cross-reference. I am only sorry the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) is not here to demolish his noble Friend on that score.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He would never do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He would do it very
	<span class='label label-info column'>196</span>
politely, more politely than I would do, but nevertheless the effect would be the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All I am saying is that it would not be right to take this into a Town and Country Planning Measure. Of course we have consulted. After all, we are all under the one Secretary of State. I assure the hon. Gentleman that there is no contradiction between what we are proposing here in Part II and Part V of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Bill which we discussed last night.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must remember that this is a Clause which requires an owner or his agent to do certain things. I would emphasise that. After all, the person having control can mean the factor of the property, which was the point the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Gordon Campbell) asked about. The Clause requires them to do certain things. If they fail to do them, the local authority can move in and do the repairs for them. I hope that, as a result of clarifying and broadening this item of housing legislation, we shall see local authorities using their powers much more extensively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that there are some who, for one reason or another, will drag out the process in the courts, leaving the poor tenant in as wretched a condition as when it started. However zealous the local authority may be, going time and time again to the court, this small minority of clever landlords, and I am glad to say that they are a small minority, are able to avoid the present law. I am not saying that the Bill will cure all that, but at least it will give an authority a better base to argue its case. Indeed, we have deliberately avoided making a distinction between "serious disrepair" and "disrepair" for the reason that we wish this to be left to the discretion of all those involved in the Court of Appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After all, if it comes to the Court of Appeal, the sheriff is not judging entirely on his own, but judging on the basis of evidence provided by expert witnesses called by the local authority, or, if the factor or the landlord believes himself aggrieved, called on his behalf. The assessment is made then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult to define "serious disrepair" and simply "disrepair" in a Bill. I take the point that it might have been a good thing to have had a standard of disrepair, but it is more difficult to attempt a standard of disrepair than it is to at-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1251">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>197</span>
tempt a "tolerable standard". For "tolerable standard" we have laid down different requirements and we can change "tolerable standard" by regulations and vary it from district to district. In other words, we can improve the situation generally and we can improve the situation in different localities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be argued that we could do the same for a standard of disrepair, but, frankly, I should find that rather a challenging task. From all the conversations I have had, I have come to the conclusion that it is better to leave it in the hands of the sheriff's courts in the last analysis, and in the first analysis in the hands of people who exercise common sense and knowledge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for going into this matter, but it is the state of "serious disrepair" which needs to be considered. The hon. Gentleman is talking about a state of "disrepair". Both are mentioned in the Clause, but it is the state of "serious disrepair" which requires some clarification. If it is difficult to define, perhaps there is some better way of clarifying it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacKenzie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has suggested in the course of our discussions that when he publishes his manual of advice and guidance to local authorities he will mention one or two specific problems. Is this the sort of situation about which a little advice could be given to local authorities? My hon. Friend said that common sense will prevail. Not all local authorities are possessed of the same degree of common sense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I readily accept that. I shall certainly look at this. Indeed, I was about to say that it will be worth making further efforts to see whether we can get a common standard of disrepair. It is more important to get a standard of disrepair on a uniform basis of appreciation than it is to divide disrepair into two parts. After all, that is what the Bill does. The Bill assumes that disrepair can be defined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend says that that is all very well but that we should have a standard. That is a fair comment—easy to claim, but difficult to deliver. But "serious disrepair" has to be a matter of discretion. If it is difficult to make a standard of "disrepair". It is just as difficult to make a standard of "serious disre-
	<span class='label label-info column'>198</span>
pair" as a standard of "disrepair".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why subsection (4) is so vital. If matters go wrong—and the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn grasped this quickly when he spoke about subsection (4)—in the assessment of serious disrepair, the safety net of subsection (4) will be there to catch those properties which are in disrepair but not serious disrepair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I shall certainly have a look at this to see whether it is possible to achieve this administratively. It may be that we can, but I should not like to hold out the hope that by a handbook and so on we shall get this as right as we should like. But this is not the last Housing Bill that we shall introduce as a Government with a long life a head of us, but we must take it step by step, closing all the loopholes that have been left by hon. Members opposite over all the miserable 13 years they were in power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the big loopholes we discovered was in the operation of repairs to storm damage. I am glad to confirm to the Committee today that, despite that terrible hurricane which swept over the West of Scotland and over parts of the East of Scotland we have now witnessed the repairing of our stock of houses to a higher standard than before the hurricane. As you know, Mr. Robertson, this is very true in Paisley which is so much a part of the West of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When a person tells a sanitary inspector that the roof of his house is leaking the sanitary inspector is unable to distinguish whether it is due to the storm. In fact, every roof leak since the storm has been claimed—and who can deny it?—to have been caused by the storm. I remember speeches by the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) and his sensible comments and that of the Leader of the Opposition when they said that while we could record the damage done, and it ran into hundreds of thousands of roofs, not just of houses—in Glasgow 10,000 roofs were affected in the private sector alone—there would be much concealed damage which would emerge as the years went on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have tried to deal with that as best we could in the Bill. I am very glad to confirm that, with all the work done in Glasgow, we are now going on to the felted roofs, which we regarded as semipermanent repairs, to get on with the slating and tiling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know why the Opposition concen-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1252">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>199</span>
trated on Glasgow in their unfair and unscrupulous attacks on the Government about storm damage. I know this personally from bitter experience of the campaign of abuse and misrepresentation. I shall not allow this to pass.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had to go a great deal in Glasgow and we have faced tremendous difficulties, because multiple ownership, which is often forgotten, is one of the great curses of home ownership in the West of Scotland. It is difficult to get correlation between one set of tenants and another, some of whom are under a different form of administration, and some, as my hon. Friend the Member for Rutherglen said, under no administration at all because there is no owner and no agent of the owner to be found. The terrible dilemma facing these poor souls in these properties is that there is no one answerable for the state of these properties. That is why this Clause is so strengthened and broadened, so that we shall not be in that humiliating position again, unable to go to court to get this work done. We shall be able to take all the steps if ever Scotland is faced with such a calamity again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many lessons to be learned by individuals. I hope that many people learn that insurance for storm damage and other acts of God is something that they ought to consider seriously. This was one of the difficulties with compensation. How do we compensate someone who did not insure? And what do we do about the man who did insure—the wise virgin who chose to make provision for some difficulty ahead as distinct from the foolish person who decided to take a risk?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In fairness to some of the landlords I should say that some of the insurance companies would not allow these properties to be insured because of their very nature—the high Victorian chimneys that were blown down and caused so much damage to the property. Some properties were in such a terrible state of disrepair that none of the insurance companies would accept any storm damage insurance on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many lessons to be learned and the Government have certainly learned their lesson. It would be a foolish Government who did not learn lessons from that calamity. It was a great city for me that I could not turn up the files of 1927, when I was two, to find out what
	<span class='label label-info column'>200</span>
the then Government did in that serious hurricane, which did not cause such extensive damage in the West of Scotland, of which Lord Provost, John Johnstone, reminded me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Moray and Nairn was told on several occasions by the Lord Provost of the Corporation's splendid efforts in the repair of properties, both publicly-owned and privately-owned. He was told also of the splendid co-operation which the Corporation had from the Government. I am sorry that he joined in a great deal of the attack on the Government. I remember an article in the 	<i>Economist</i> which attacked Glasgow Corporation in particular—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Robertson. You appealed to hon. Members to keep to the Amendments. I wonder whether the Minister is indulging your indulgence too far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is no point of order, as the hon. Member knows very well. The Question is, "That the Clause stand part of the Bill," and I am allowing a wide discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall finish on this point because I did not intend to go any further than this. I was the subject of a great deal of attack, and so was my right hon. Friend. There were several debates on this subject in the Scottish Grand Committee and I feel it right and proper to set the record straight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can remember a very wicked article in the 	<i>Economist</i> attacking not all the authorities in Scotland, but Glasgow itself. It was a dreadful article because it got the facts wrong. It pretended that the City of Glasgow had not suffered as much as, say, Greenock or Stirling. It is true that these towns suffered a great deal—so did Clydebank, Rutherglen, Paisley and so on, right through a long list—but it was quite untrue to say that Glasgow suffered less than others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman wrote a letter to the 	<i>Economist</i> endorsing the article, saying that it was splendid. His only complaint against the article was that it did not attack the Government strongly enough. That is the kind of activity which I thought very unfair. Of course it is right to chastise Ministers who do not work hard enough. It is right to criticise a Government which make a mistake. But at a time of national emergency it is fair
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1253">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>201</span>
and proper to be reasonable and give people a chance and to be fair and honest in criticism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can tell the hon. Gentleman, if he does not know it already, that in Glasgow his letter caused a great deal of resentment. I should like him to put the record clear now by saying with the rest of us that Glasgow Corporation and all the local authorities concerned, with the inadequate powers at their disposal, an inadequacy which we are correcting in Clause 25, did a splendid job in dealing with what was one of the most serious acts of God that ever was visited on the West of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That speech was most regrettable. We recognise the pressure under which the Minister is being placed and how sometimes his tongue gets the better of him. but I understood that what we were trying to do was to make good progress with the Bill and not rake over old sores. In spite of what I hoped was an indication that if he went on in that way he would get one or two things back which he might not like and which would be bound to delay the course of the Bill, the Minister continued. He must not expect to be allowed to get away with criticising my hon. Friend and have nothing back from this side of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that most citizens of Glasgow will agree that the Government completely underestimated the amount of damage and that the Minister of State was unable to do what a Minister of State ought to do because he was held in Committee with the then Minister of Transport doing things appropriate to an Under-Secretary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I worked like a slave.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may say that he worked like a slave. In point of fact, instead of being up in Scotland directing affairs, as any Minister of State should have been, he was detained down here. Ministers from the Scottish Office were like a visiting circus turning up one after another, each having to be acquainted with the facts. It was a monstrous display of ineptitude and it was only because my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition had a debate in the House, in Opposition time—and even then only two or three months after that—that the Government pulled up their socks and got down to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>202</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does not serve much purpose to haggle over what did or did not happen, except that those of us who know precisely the amount of work which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and the Minister of State did during the crisis must resent the remarks of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith). They were quite out of keeping with any decency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One brisk question of substance: earlier in his speech, my hon. Friend the Minister of State expressed the hope that local authorities would use their powers. I am one who is very cynical about the merits of simply passing legislation, because it is often not acted upon. I wonder what steps he and the Department are taking to bring this power to the notice of the local authorities. Is he to visit them to explain what they can do? Alternatively, precisely what is the Department doing in this important issue?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not realised that the hon. Member, as the hon. Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) said intended to go into all these matters of articles written some time ago in the 	<i>Economist</i> and so on. As he has, I should just like to make it clear that my visits to the Lord Provost and to the storm damage centre in Glasgow and the tours on which the officials took me to see the storm damage were subsequent to the letter which I wrote to the Economist. Certainly no indication was given to me by the Lord Provost or any of the others that there was any resentment about that letter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Just to put it in a true light for any hon. Members who were not aware of the incident, I should like to point out that my letter was short, simply pointing out that in my opinion the Government were to some extent to blame for the slowness with which the operation got off the ground. That was what I said. In this respect, the effect of my letter was to remove some of the blame which the article in the Economist had pinned on local authorities, including Glasgow Corporation. I was trying to be perfectly fair, saying that it was not Glasgow Corporation and other local authorities, but the Government who had to take some share of the blame for the delay in getting off the ground.

I would be the first to admit that the absence of a Clause in a Measure of the

	<span class='label label-info column'>203</span>
kind which we are now discussing was one of the difficulties, but that should not be used as an excuse for slowness in getting off the ground. If my letter, which was a short, simple letter and very much to the point, criticising the Government as a whole and making no reference to any Ministers,
<br><br><!-- lb -->
certainly not to the hon. Gentleman, has had the effect some five months later of still injuring the hon. Gentleman—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And Glasgow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The hon. Member knows very well that I myself have been very much concerned, as was my predecessor in this "Shadow" office, my right hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble), about the effects of this catastrophe which hit a part of Scotland. We in the North of Scotland by some curious good fortune were not affected by this hurricane; it did not affect my constituency or my area. But we were all very much concerned at this catastrophe which hit a densely populated part of Scotland. Therefore, I have naturally been following what has been going on and, among other things, I wrote that brief letter to the 	<i>Economist.</i> However, I do not want to spend time on these matters—I agree with the hon. Member for West Lothian about that—but I thought I should just put this issue in its proper perspective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Coming back to the point that I raised originally, the hon. Gentleman was explaining why it was difficult to have a set of criteria or a definition for the term a state of "serious disrepair". It must be agreed that the whole operation of the Clause will hang on the judgment of what is a state of serious disrepair, because the first sentence, which brings the whole of the Clause into operation, depends upon a local authority being satisfied that a house is in a state of serious disrepair. As the hon. Gentleman has said, subsection (4) has the effect of bringing other houses that are not in a serious state of disrepair at the moment, but may be in the future, into the same category. So the whole Clause depends on this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have listened to the Minister's explanation of the difficulties and I agree that it is a difficult matter. On the other hand, it is important that we should try
	<span class='label label-info column'>204</span>
to deal with it, because I foresee that otherwise there will be difficulties when the Clause is put into action. I hope that the Government will give this further consideration to see whether there is something more that can be done in the Bill, even though the Minister said that this was the kind of matter that he hoped would be dealt with in regulations or in the guidance to local authorities which will probably depend upon regulations which the Secretary of State will make. It seems to me that this is something to which the Government will have to bend their minds, and I should have thought it useful if something could be put into the Bill to make it clear what this serious state of disrepair is expected to be in the view of the Government, for guidance to the local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that the Minister became polemical at the end of this debate and we had references to gaps left from the period of 13 years of the Conservative Government. In answer to that, if the Minister cannot deal with this point in the Bill, now or at a later stage, it looks like a gap which he will leave for us to deal with in the operation of the Bill. If in two years or so the Clause is being operated and difficulties arise about the question of what is a state of serious disrepair, we shall have to cope with them. At that stage it will be a question of giving guidance to local authorities, and I hope that we can do more about this in Parliament before the Bill is passed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Gentleman knows, the Opposition are in favour of the intentions in the Clause. There is no doubt about that, but we should like to improve it. We think that redrafting of subsection (4) would be an improvement and, linked with that, something to indicate more precisely what is a state of serious disrepair. This would enable those who have to put the Clause into operation to know what is intended and it will also be easier for the sheriffs to settle disputes—of course, we hope that few disputes will arise. The hon. Gentleman knows that this is the kind of provision which means that there will undoubtedly be appeals by individuals who, for one reason or another, feel genuinely aggrieved, and if the arbitration itself seems woolly, if there seems to be difficulty in understanding what the criteria are, it will not make
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1255">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>205</span>
for the easy settling of disputes. It will probably mean that people are still left aggrieved. I hope that the Minister will be able to say that the Government will give further thought to this at a later stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 51, in page 17, line 39, leave out "with the approval of the Treasury".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hasten to say that the purpose of the Amendment is not the usual purpose of these Amendments which remove "with the approval of the Treasury", which I remember debating on many occasions in the Scottish Committee on many different Scottish Bills. It is always a useful opportunity for the Opposition to probe and discover to what extent the Secretary of State for Scotland is controlled by the Treasury. But that is not the purpose, and I hope that the Minister of State will realise that the traditional arguments will not be used on this occasion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>206</span>
hope the hon. Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles (Mr. David Steel) will listen to my argument with close interest to see why I have moved the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When Amendments of this nature are discussed it is usually because Government money is being spent through the agency of the Secretary of State for Scotland. The Amendments have been attempts to give the Secretary of State much closer control. However, this is an utterly different argument, because the money to be spent is local authority money. It is to be spent on repairs. Power is to be given to a local authority to recover that money from those for whom the repairs have been carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Clause rightly contains machinery for fixing a rate of interest on the outstanding account for repairs due to a local authority. Therefore, this is not money which has come from the Treasury, not money lent by the Treasury, but simply money spent by a local authority which it is recovering and which is outstanding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why is it necessary in this case in setting the rates of interest to be charged on this outstanding money that it should be done with the approval of the Treasury?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
