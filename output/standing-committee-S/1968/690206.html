	<p>	<i>Further Amendment proposed</i> [	<i>4th February</i>], No. 6, in page 2, line 13, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>(4) Without prejudice to the provisions of subsection (3)(	<i>a</i>) above, every education authority shall be under a duty to make available for the use of ratepayers in their area, subject to such conditions, including the payment of charges and times of use, as they think fit, the facilities in terms of the preceding subsection.—[	<i>Mr. Younger.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Bruce Millan)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had almost finished my remarks. I had made two substantial points about the Amendment. The first was that, however sympathetic I felt towards the objective of the hon. Gentleman, I felt that the Amendment was impractical and that no other form of wording would give a practicable solution to the problem Which he projected. My second substantial point was that the Amendment raised the whole question of the relationship between central and local government and was trying to give authority to central Government to do certain things which, by their nature, could reasonably be dealt with only at local level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only detailed points which I have not answered are those about the Government's attitude towards sports, recreation, youth and community service generally, and the point raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Lanarkshire, North (Miss Herbison) about the difficulties in her area, particularly with regard to the Scotia Sports Club.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be inappropriate for me to give a detailed answer to that second point. The right hon. Lady knows that
	<span class='label label-info column'>104</span>
I have been involved in some of these talks and my Department has been trying to resolve the problems at local level. A good deal of progress has been made in recent weeks. She may know the position a good deal better than I do, but perhaps I should write to her and bring the position up to date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the matter of the Government, as distinct from local authorities, taking seriously the making of recreational and other facilities available particularly to young people, expenditure over the last few years has increased considerably. We are spending more at Government level, quite apart from local authority level, than ever before. To take, as an example, the help which the Government give to local sports clubs, the figures for the current year are four times those for 1964–65. This shows the tremendous increase in the assistance which we are giving, and that we take the matter seriously, but I am still unable to recommend the Committee to accept the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an impressive and constructive debate, and valuable points have been put forward by the hon. Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) and by the right hon. Lady the Member for Lanarkshire, North (Miss Herbison) which I wish to take up shortly, particularly the view that it is up to us in this Committee to give a lead to local authorities in the provision of sports and recreational facilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been a complicated debate, and one has never quite known the right moment to participate in the series of Amendments, but in the end of the day we shall have a value consensus of opinion that we must do as much as we can within the limits of our finance to promote recreation in Scotland through local education authorities. The hon. Member for West Lothian was right in saying that it is ridiculous to pass legislation if we do not follow it through. If we give local authorities encouragement to promote the provision of recreational facilities, it is up to us to see that it happens, and that the money voted by the House to education in general is used in an economical and valuable way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have always said that it is right for local authorities to take an interest in promoting sport and recreation and to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0508">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>105</span>
develop the community concept put tor-ward by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) on Tuesday, but local authorities can play their part in other ways than through education. Many authorities give a discretionary 50 per cent. reduction in rates, for recreational buildings and I hope that more and more will follow that lead. It is not in fact nearly as expensive as it is thought to be by many members of local authorities. Other authorities give direct assistance by the provision of facilities, in the way that Dumfries, three years ago, provided a wonderful new swimming bath.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities have a changing rôle. The cost of new recreation halls, swimming baths, and so on, cannot now be sustained by private clubs, and local authorities and Government must participate. I give warm praise to the Government for their assistance to private sports clubs to build pavilions and to provide playing fields; it has been excellent. It is a trend which was bound to come, and I am glad that they have followed it through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will, in the long term, be a much greater use of recreational facilities by many more people, and local authorities must give a lead in this direction through joint planning. This is not purely an educational matter. The education authority and the planning authority must get together to plan for the provision of facilities for sport. Good advice is available through the Council for Physical Recreation and through the Sports Council, both nationally and regionally, and I am far from certain that local authorities make sufficient use of the advice which is available to them. Many organisations are shouting out to help, and excellent books, such as the one on planning for sport, are available. This is where we fall down, through ignorance of what can be done and how.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the hon. Member for Ross and Cromarty (Mr. Alasdair Mackenzie) would agree that there are many regional variations in sport, and what may be important in the Highlands may be less important farther south. I would rely on local councils to give due weight to the sports for which there is a demand in their own region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>106</span>
Although in this debate we are in general talking about the provision of recreational facilities by educational authorities, we are also indicating that the public should be able to participate in the use of the facilities which are provided, and that these facilities should not be kept exclusively for use by schoolchildren.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Lady the Member for Lanarkshire, North was right to stress the problems of those in the 15 to 19 age group. There are several reasons for this, but two come immediately to mind. Many young people who leave school at 15 are shy about joining private sports clubs, a rugby club or a soccer club; they hesitate to take the step of joining and meeting new people. There is also the physical difficulty that young lads of 15 or 16 do not feel that they are able with any pleasure to play with or against people who are in their 20's. We must encourage new soccer clubs and rugby clubs to cater for such young people in this void after leaving school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that Education area subcommittees of local authorities frequently give permission for the use of recreational facilities which are presently available. This is right. I appreciate that there may be difficulties. A school may have an unhappy experience in that a club has not treated the school as it should have been treated, and thereafter there may be disinclination to give permission. Often, the weight of opinion of the headmaster of the school at an area sub-committee has led the committee to refuse permission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart stressed the position of janitors, but this can and must be overcome. No one is expecting the janitor to work a seven-day week; that would be quite wrong; but we should encourage the building up of a body of responsible people to take over his duty for Saturday and Sunday in relation to the provision of sport and recreational facilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a significant trend towards divorcing the recreational facilities of the school from the educational facilities, so that the public do not go into the school at weekends or in the evenings in order to use the sports facilities, and I hope this trend will continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0509">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>107</span>
The hon. Member for West Lothian stressed the state of the playing fields. Whoever drew up the scale of provision of a certain number of soccer and rugby pitches for each school could have had no idea that it rains in Scotland. When one drives about in Scotland one sees dreadful mud heaps which are supposed to be playing fields. Anyone who has played games knows that, the better the facilities, the better the games which are played. It is impossible to play games on a mud heap, especially games like girls' hockey. In places which have a wet climate, such as in the west of Scotland, the number of playing fields must be increased, so that they are not played on as much as they are at present. It may be possible to play four games of soccer a week on the average playing field in the west of Scotland, but schools want to play three or four games a day. It is no wonder that the playing fields become a wet mud heap by the end of November and do not recover till the beginning of the next season.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although endless advice is available to education authorities about how to provide high quality playing fields, the advice is not used. One cannot leave a football pitch in April and expect that it will be all right again by the next September. It must be mowed during the summer, and sand and fertiliser must be applied to provide a good field for the winter. A playing field must be in a suitable condition for use all the year round. We will get nowhere by trying to provide sport on the cheap. Local education authorities must put money into playing fields if they want results.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the right hon. Lady has said, much can be done in the character building of children through sport and recreation. If boys and girls are encouraged to develop character, to learn about the team spirit and to accept the jurisdiction of the referee, they are a long way towards becoming first-class people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the hon. Gentleman was talking about the condition into which playing fields get and suggesting how that might be remedied, I wondered whether it had escaped his mind that professional football clubs, with fields which are played on only once a week at this time of the year and
	<span class='label label-info column'>108</span>
which are under constant care and supervision, still have to face the problem with which the hon. Gentleman is dealing in relation to schools. So far they have found no solution. From time to time on Saturdays we hear of games being postponed throughout Scotland and elsewhere, including rugby matches, because of the weather.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point. I am surprised, with the mint of money behind some soccer clubs, that their grounds are in such deplorable condition. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will do me the pleasure of coming to Murrayfield in a fortnight to see the kind of ground which can be provided if the effort is put into it by the use of electric blankets and so on. Why soccer clubs allow their players, at £200 a week, to break their legs on some of these frozen grounds is beyond my comprehension.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a tricky point because of the different nature of games, and the use of studs in boots, etcetra. This is very difficult.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, indeed. I hope that we can give a lead to very much greater provision of all-weather playing fields. I know that they cost perhaps £7,000 or £8,000, but at least they can be played upon all day and every day. In the long run they are probably a great economic advantage. At least soccer and hockey can be played. I think it is only cricket and rugby which cannot be played on these grounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As Members of the Committee have indicated, the trend is towards bigger sports complexes with dual provision both for schools and for the communities. I am sure that this will continue. We can use these facilities throughout the day for schools and in the evenings for adults. This is where we shall get value for the taxpayers' and ratepayers' money both for education and for adults.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people are really keen to participate in sport. The national figures in Britain are that there are about 750,000 soccer players, 100,000 rugby players, 320,000 cricketers, and an incalculable number of swimmers. I take the point about the importance of swimming. There is a huge market of keen people, perhaps developed through television and so on, who want to participate in games
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0510">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>109</span>
in Scotland, and it is up to us to try to provide these facilities within our financial resources. We must encourage local authorities to participate in the trend that I am indicating and to make these facilities available. I accept that at the moment they probably use their discretion wisely. If nothing else, the debate has shown the way we want things to go in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is right, of course, to say that the Clause raises the whole question of the relationship between national and local government. I should like to follow the hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) because, as he says, there really is a very considerable danger of making ourselves look bogus by passing legislation which we cannot follow through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was at the Oxford University Labour Club last night, and, on the subject of Parliament and Whitehall, I was hammered by some of Dr. Norman Hunt's pupils on the way in which Parliament gets into disrepute by passing legislation which, in their opinion, and, I think, with some justice, is not carried into any kind of actuality. Therefore I say o the Minister that on Tuesday, in certain respects, he painted far too rosy a picture of the actual situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that it would be useful to follow through an actual case in some depth, not because I want a constituency prob lem put right in this way but as an ex ample of what is happening. From this case, certain legislative consequences flow. I am referring to St. Colomba's School at Boghall, Bathgate. Two years ago almost to the day my wife and I attended the opening of St. Colomba's Roman Catholic Primary School in Boghall. At that time I noted in my diary that it was a pity that the playing fields could not be ready for the school opening. Soothing assurances were given that soon all would be well and I should be patient, but, two years later, not a ball has been kicked, not a game has been played because the place round the school is still a quagmire and the sort of mud bath that the hon. Member for Dumfries described. It is unlikely to be fit for the youngsters till after the summer; this is three school years after the school was opened. So I ask the Minister; what about this
	<span class='label label-info column'>110</span>
readily available technical advice which he was telling us about on Tuesday?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt, but really this is not strictly relevant to the Amendment, which deals with making facilities generally available once they are provided in schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have to provide the facilities to make them available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are dealing with an entirely different point from that of the adequacy of facilities, with which I dealt last v/eek.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not agree with the Minister. I am following carefully his own speech on the Amendment and raising points from it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is an interesting story of what is happening, rather than what is supposed to be happening in the view of St. Andrew's House. Before passing legislation it would be wise to look at the real world. In this case a firm of architects, Messrs. Alison and Hutchison, is immediately responsible. According to the headmaster, who is a totally reliable and respected witness whom I have known for fifteen years, the architects got some contractors to send out four or five men with a tractor at infrequent occasions, but on those occasions there was no one, and certainly no one with any expertise, in charge. There were deficiencies. There was no top soil and no correct grading. It is scarce wonder that this place has ended up as a sea of mud. This was accepted by the West Lothian County Council, so the headmaster cannot do other than refuse to use it. The main contractors were Harrison's. I paid a full day's visit to Harrison's housing work in West Lothian during the Recess. Their punctuality on finishing jobs is excellent and I am in no way criticising this contractor, but I am told that they are so disgusted with what happened in the matter of laying of playing fields that they are to set up their own playing fields organisation, but it is difficult for them to get expertise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister; what about this strong team of inspectors with readily available advice? What has been their rôle? I have news for the Minister.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0511">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>111</span>
Their rôle has been zero. The headmaster, Mr. Dugan, tells me that since Mr. Cameron of the Scottish Education Department's building and works department spent half an hour at the school on opening day in February, 1966, no inspector has set foot inside the door.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are getting a bit wide of the Amendment. I allowed the hon. Member to dilate on this specific case, because the Minister touched on these matters, but he is going on at length. If he examines the Amendment carefully the hon. Member will see that we are dealing with provisions
	<br><blockquote><p>"for the use of ratepayers".</p></blockquote>
We are assuming that the part dealing with children is accepted at the moment and we are dealing with a specific Amendment. I appreciate the hon. Member's point, but I would be grateful if he could draw this specific instance to a fairly rapid close.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will, of course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is illustrative, and I take the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will draw it to a very rapid close indeed. There has been no sign of the Chief Inspector coming down. The point is that Mr. Dugan quotes Mr. Burnett of the architects, Alison and Hutchison and Partners, as complaining,
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Department simply will not come out."</p></blockquote>
As I am cutting the story I will draw this conclusion. If this were an isolated case I would not be bothering the Committee with it. I do not think that it is typical—I hope that it is not—but this kind of thing happens far too often to allow us to be complacent about passing rather general legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the policy conclusions from this which seem to me to be directly relevant to the Amendment. First, public expenditure. I am always reasonable. I give notice that in a fortnight's time I will put down a Question asking the Secretary of State if he will give the full cost of recreational facilities in St. Colomba's School. I hope that the Minister will be able to write to me about it. I think that it is legitimate to make the point, in considering legislation, that when I was a member of the Public Accounts Committee I was so worried about costing procedures in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>112</span>
Scottish Office that I persuaded the then Chairman to have the Livingston Development Corporation brought before that Committee—in my view, with wholly beneficial results. I have in mind the possibility of doing something that I have never done before, namely, putting all the facts one way and the other before the Ombudsman so that he can look at the question——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is interesting, but the hon. Member's future actions bear no relation to the wording of the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Then I will go directly to what the Minister said on Tuesday:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The relationship is not like that."</p></blockquote>
I am rebuked for having got the relationship wrong.
	<br><blockquote><p>"Largely through the Inspectorate, problems such as this can be dealt with on a day-to-day basis by discussions between the education authority and the Inspectorate and also formally in discussions between the authority and the Department as a Department. I do not think that there is any difficulty in the procedure, whether formal or informal, for dealing with a matter of this sort."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 4th February, 1969, c. 99.]</p></blockquote>
My comment is that it did not operate in the case of St. Colomba's school, Boghall, Bathgate. Why is the end product so often so unsatisfactory?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another policy conclusion, and that is the whole question of the relationship between the S.E.D. and the contractors. I should like to be constructive. Small contractors are simply not capable, by their very nature——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member is really going beyond the terms of the Amendment. He is dealing with general policy. By the Amendment we are tied down to a specific part of that policy, namely, the use of additional facilities by ratepayers. I should be grateful if the hon. Member would confine himself to that narrow margin.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.0 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I … dispute the proposition that large sums of money are being wasted in any area … whether on playing fields or in the provision of the buildings."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 4th February, 1969, c. 85.]</p></blockquote>
When one probes in depth, one becomes concerned about whether, when the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0512">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>113</span>
Minister says that money is not being wasted, the situation is as satisfactory as some of us would wish to make out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this context I ask that consideration be given to one or two propositions for the spending of ratepayers' money. On reflection, I do not favour the first one, which is that there should be a public organisation to set up playing fields and to do this job. The second—and this is what I should like to see—is that the expertise should be concentrated in a few of our large contractors. To save ratepayers' and taxpayers' money, it strikes me that there is a good case for the S.E.D., arbitrarily—and I should back it in this—choosing three or four of our major contractors and concentrating in those firms the expertise that is undoubtedly needed in the laying out of playing fields.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is relevant to add that that might make sense only in terms of local government reform, and how, on the basis of larger units, one could work this in a meaningful way. Unlike the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger), I am not privy to the inner workings of Lord Wheatley's mind, so I do not know what he will recommend, but if the hon. Gentleman, who seems to have special knowledge of these matters, knowledge certainly not available to the rest of us, is right, and there are to be larger units, there will be another framework for discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the Minister's remarks on the last occasion, when he said that I had, a misconception of the relationship between the central Government and local government on such matters. I am by nature a non-interferer in local government, but we have before us a Bill which talks about adequate and inadequate recreational facilities. Some of us want to make sure that these are not just words. Without being pompous and insufferable about it I think I can say that I am against humbug and cant in legislation, and this is a danger which, heaven knows, not only this Government but the last and every Government for a long time, have been getting into. I thought that the speech of the hon. Member for Ayr was very much to the point. It is a danger which we all face, regardless of party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>114</span>
There is another matter which I have to face, and I am looking now at what the Minister said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am surprised at the enthusiasm being shown by everyone for the Department telling local education authorities how they should go about their business."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>First Scottish Standing Committee</i>, 4th February, 1969, c. 99.]</p></blockquote>
That was clearly a reflection on my right hon. Friend the Member for Lanarkshire, North (Miss Herbison) and myself. My right hon. Friend is capable of speaking for herself, so I shall not presume to speak for her. There is no need here for surprise. It is easily explained. As local representatives, many of us are dissatisfied with the end product. Eight years ago I took a school team to the Palatinate in Germany, and subsequently I took the West Lothian County Football team to Stockholm, Leningrad and Copenhagen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member will perhaps pardon my ignorance, but are these pupils at school, or are they people outside school establishments, literally ratepayers, who would use these facilities? If they are schoolchildren, what the hon. Member is saying is out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Fortunately, on this occasion, I have the best of both worlds, because one team was made up of schoolchildren, and the other of ratepayers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is half in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the Department done any international study of what happens abroad? Those who go abroad—and I suspect that some hon. Gentlemen opposite do—with teams of various kinds cannot, quite often, but be ashamed of our facilities. It is this sort of thing which prompts the kind of speech that I am making this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a member of the Commonwealth Games Main Organising Committee. The point which arises relates to the sharing of facilities after the Games in 1970. At some stage, in order to get adequate recreational facilities in the Edinburgh and east Scotland area, I should like to be a little clear about the S.E.D.s policy for allowing the use of these facilities to athletes and others from neighbouring authorities outside the City of Edinburgh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0513">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>115</span>
I should like to reinforce the plea made by the hon. Member for Dumfries and couple with it the question of what we are doing for indoor sports. As the hon. Gentleman said, with weather like ours it is incredible that the provision we make for indoor sport compares so unfavourably with what is done in other places. I was President of the Scottish Amateur Basketball Association, and I know that our facilities compare unfavourably with those in Sweden and other countries which have weather similar to ours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Tuesday the Minister said that the youngsters of today were unattracted to youth clubs which were run in secondary schools. Ten or even five years ago I should have agreed with that proposition, but I wonder whether it is true now. As we build better and better schools, the attendance rate rises. I am thinking of schools—all of us have them—at Blackburn, Bathgate, and so on. There has been an extremely creditable school building programme, and one wonders whether what the Minister said is still true.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not follow the hon. Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) in his line of argument, even though it was intensely interesting and was a valuable contribution to the debate. It shows that we can generate heat and controversy in this Committee without there being any party content whatsoever in the matters under discussion. I think that this is extremely satisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that what the Minister has said so far today demonstrates his good will and good intentions in this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I am not satisfied about—and here I think I might find that the hon. Member for West Lothian is with me—is that the Minister is seized of the real nature of what I am trying to suggest to him. The difficulties which I have outlined, those which have been outlined by my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) and those, slightly different it is true, which have been outlined by the hon. Member for West Lothian, may well arise, because the provision of sport and recreational facilities is, and always has been, more or less a peripheral part of the provision of education generally. It has not been
	<span class='label label-info column'>116</span>
an activity or an undertaking on its own. The provision of these facilities ought to be a function on its own, and which gives priority to the needs of education. That is different from saying that we must provide facilities for education which shall include sports facilities which can be used by other people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept what the Minister said about the wording of the Amendment being incorrect, and perhaps not achieving what I intend, but I am trying to suggest to the Minister that all is not well with the way in which we spend our money to provide sports and recreational facilities. I am suggesting—I hope in a constructive way—that the Minister and his Department ought to look at the procedures which are gone through in the planning of school recreational facilities. I am suggesting that they should be changed so that there will automatically be a main emphasis on the provision of these facilities for the community in general, with priority for the needs of education above those of the rest of the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a different emphasis from what we have had so far. If there were that emphasis it would solve many of the existing problems. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) rightly suggested that there is a need for fine school halls to be available for use by young people for dancing on Friday and Saturday evenings. He said that it was often difficult to arrange this because the janitors could not be expected to work seven days a week. My hon. Friend is right, but the problem arises not so much from the hours which have to be worked by the janitors—although this is a problem—as from the fact that, because these facilities are part and parcel of a school building, we cannot conveniently provide them without opening the whole school to the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole matter comes back to the original question of how the facilities are laid out. If they are planned well in advance, with the sole purpose of saying that the community generally will be able to use them, the school hall, and only the hall, can be used for dances, without setting at risk the security of toilets, of libraries, of classrooms, of coat racks, and so on, in the rest of the school. That is why there should be a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0514">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>117</span>
complete change of emphasis in the way these things are planned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some mention has been made of the relationship between central and local government. I go along with what the hon. Member for West Lothian said, that generally speaking he was a non-inter-vener in local affairs, but we cannot turn a blind eye to the real principles on which this money is spent when such a large amount of central Government money is being used for this purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I might try to make clearer why I think that this is more important than just a matter of the proper use of Government money, important though that is in itself. We often criticise ourselves for the fact that our performances at sporting events throughout the world are less successful than we hoped. Whenever this happens there is a public debate about what is wrong, and why the British team was not as well trained as other teams were. why we did not have as many wins as smaller countries had, and so on. Whenever this happens, there is a general public desire to do something about it, but that desire lasts for only a short time, and then nothing more is done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Suppose we decided to try to do something about that. It is not use thinking that anything can be done quickly. What we need is a change in our national attitude to the provision of sporting facilities. Only then, after a delay of perhaps ten to fifteen years, shall be begin to see results. The hon. Member for West Lothian referred to experience abroad. At the end of last year I visited the United States, and I was tremendously impressed to see in several schools and educational establishments, and in establishments outside schools, the facilities available for sports and recreation. The facilities there are inevitably more lavish and more expensive than ours, but, from a very young age, children have these facilities available within easy reach of their homes, and they use them in such a way that, looking ten years ahead, those who are able to, can get to the top and be really good at their chosen branch of sport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This can be done only if it is a general rule that throughout the country the pro-Vision and use of sports facilities is con-
	<span class='label label-info column'>118</span>
sidered in a business like way. At present, even with the best intentions, it is done on a half-measure basis. There is much enthusiasm but not sufficient planning. I hope that, as a first step, our attitude towards the provision of these facilities will be changed and that the Minister will accept the Amendment in that spirit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The discussion has become very involved indeed. While it might be thought that the Amendment deals with the ratepayer and so conflicts with the Bill, which deals with the pupil, we cannot dissociate the two. The Minister may say that he does not have a great concern with the ratepayer in this matter, and that responsibility for the ratepayer belongs to another Department. Nevertheless, as the Minister responsible for adult education, the interests of the ratepayer must come within his purview.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have studied the Minister's comments on the remarks I made at Tuesday's Sitting, particularly about swimming. I thank him for his reply, but I must probe the matter further. He said that swimming facilities were being increased both in terms of what is being provided at the educational level and in terms of public facilities. I accept that, and I also accept that he has no responsibility for public facilities in this matter, but I was not completely satisfied with what he said about what is being provided educationally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When he cited the example of the new swimming pool in Edinburgh for the Commonwealth Games and referred to the Olympic pool at East Kilbride he did not make the point that in the whole of Scotland today we have only two international swimming pools. If we are to play our full part in international competitions we must have more than two of these pools, which are insufficient to meet the growing demands of Scotland. The Minister may say that this is outside his immediate responsibility. That may be so, but I trust that my remarks will reach the appropriate quarters. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I would distinguish between facilities required for pupils learning to swim, with learner pools and swimming instruction, and the facilities required for pupils who have learned to swim…."—[OFFICIAL REPORT,

That means that in our schools——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must ask the hon. Member to keep within the narrow margins of the Amendment. We dealt with schools and pupils on two previous Amendments—the "social" and the "recreative" Amendments. The way in which I interpret this Amendment is that it is based largely on the words "for the use of ratepayers". We are dealing with additional buildings and facilities for people outside the personnel of schools, and I would therefore like the hon. Member to deal with that subject and not with pupils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but one must occasionally preface what one proposes to say and so create the proper mental environment for the remarks which are to follow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I thought that the hon. Member was repeating arguments from a previous debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was not my intention, Mr. Jennings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Member will keep within the narrow confines of the Amendment. In the meantime, I will accept his preface.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have quoted the Minister's words because it follows from them that schools will have only learner pools. The point to remember is that schools are nowadays used for further education purposes. if we are to expand further education, we must make our schools capable of that expansion. If the adult is to receive proper education in swimming he must have, not just shallow learner pools, but adequate facilities. For example, in my constituency we have an ordinary swimming pool in Kinning Park School which is very good but which does not have the necessary length and breadth for adult education, although it does have the necessary depth. It is on this point that the Minister and I appear to differ.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been engaged in this sort of work for much of my life. As the head of one of the biggest further education centres in the City of Glasgow, I had to comprehend, as it were, seven different
	<span class='label label-info column'>120</span>
schools in the Govan area because no single school had sufficient equipment and space to accommodate the adult pupils. I recall that when we introduced a public speaking class for the first time 300 adult pupils enrolled. A former Member of the House of Commons, the late Rosslyn Mitchell, was the tutor and there was, therefore, a great incentive for people to join. We could not find a classroom large enough to take that number of pupils and eventually they were accommodated in the infants' quarters where they had to sit on the desks. Nowadays a special type of hall is included in schools so that classes of that size can be accommodated for further educational purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to expand the use of schools for adult education, certain difficulties must be faced. I particularly have in mind the intrusion that this extension makes on the time of janitors. In some cases they may be required to give up their weekends. An hon. Gentleman opposite suggested that a corps of responsible people could be organised to take charge at weekends. That proposal might not be received with enthusiasm by some local authorities, particularly since the individuals concerned would have a great responsibility and a local authority would naturally be chary about such appointments. Many questions would arise, such as whether the members of such a corps would live in over the weekend. Perhaps regular janitors would object to such an arrangement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder how many hon. Members have visited the latest types of school that are being built. For example, Manse-wood in Glasgow is an entirely new architectural approach which requires two janitors for its upkeep. Because our schools are becoming so comprehensive and because so many duties must be performed to keep them running smoothly one janitor can no longer do the job. With two janitors, beautifully housed and with their houses appropriately placed to conform with their duties in maintaining the school, the problem immediately assumes an entirely different aspect. I do not think that there need be any thought about introducing any extraneous help in the organisation and working of the school over the weekend, which has always created many small difficulties. With two janitors on the spot, it is simply
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0516">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>121</span>
a case of adjustment between the janitors and of fitting in the extra work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another thought has just come to mind. I have a lot of thoughts in my mind and I could speak for a long time on this subject——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is an important subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: —but I do not mean to do so. On Tuesday I referred to the fact that I had had a communication deploring the fact that swimming facilities in schools for use by adults were being contracted. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State assured me that that was not so and that in Scotland such facilities were more abundant than ever. I was glad to hear that. However, I read an entirely different story in the 	<i>Evening News</i> last night to the effect that in many places in England people are protesting about the cutting of swimming facilities in schools. Clubs are affected and use of the pools is being limited. Therefore, once again, Scotland leads England, and long may we continue to lead her in the proper paths.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I point out to the hon. Member that an Englishman is trying his hardest so to lead the proceedings of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Despite some of the things said this morning, we are dealing in this Amendment with a comparatively narrow point. There is nothing in the present legislation which prevents local education authorities from doing such desirable things as those mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin). They have power to make these facilities available. We are extending the power by saying in the Bill that these facilities can be made available to the community at large instead of simply to those taking part in organised educational or recreational activities. We are therefore plainly meeting the wish of the Committee that we should give increased powers to local authorities to make their facilities available in the widest possible way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we are dealing with here is whether we should convert that power into a statutory duty subject, in the terms of the Amendment, to certain conditions.
	<span class='label label-info column'>122</span>
If we convert it into a duty subject to certain conditions, we are back to making it a power. Even if we accepted the Amendment, which is badly drafted in other respects as well, and tried to draft it in a better way, we should not be in any different position from that which we are in now. It is obviously undesirable to lay down a duty which cannot be imposed as an absolute obligation on a local education authority. I do not think the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) seriously questions my answer on this point. If he can think of another way of wording it or of putting it in the Bill, I should be willing, being sympathetic to the idea, to consider it, but I doubt whether we can tackle it in this way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other things which the hon. Gentleman said this morning—and I agreed almost completely with what he said—represented a much more practicable and sensible way of achieving the objects which the Committee has in mind. He talked about the way in which we dealt with school building applications. This is something which we have considered. Under the revised School Building Code, 1967, authorities are specifically asked to indicate, when they submit proposals for a school building project, what provision is intended for social and recreational facilities for use by people outside the school. Therefore, this matter is now dealt with as a matter of course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, for reasons which I gave last week, it is not always practicable or sensible to provide additional facilities in school buildings which are being erected. Sometimes they are not necessary in the sense of doing anything which costs additional money to provide facilities as distinct from having facilities which can be used by ordinary members of the public. This is all taken into account at the initial project stage by the normal procedures laid down by the Schools Building Code, 1967. I can, therefore, give an assurance on that point from the statutory or regulation point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a matter in which we in the Department take a very considerable practical interest. Many of the improvements which have been made in recent years originated as a result of stimulus from the central Government. Whether one considers facilities in the schools, in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0517">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>123</span>
community centres, in youth centres, or whatever standard one likes to take, we are now spending very considerably more than was being spent three or four years ago. I am not making a party point, but it is worth saying that this Government have done very much more in this field than have ever been done before. Obviously we have the support of everybody in what we are doing. But it is not practicable to proceed in the way adumbrated by the hon. Member for Ayr in his Amendment. I must therefore ask the Committee not to accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman realises that when we make speeches in this Committee, and when everything that we say is in order, it is up to the Minister to reply to us. We should have a much better explanation on the very important point about the quality of playing fields and where the administration has gone wrong concerning the mud heaps which we have in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not admit that the administration has gone wrong from the Government point of view. I thought that I dealt with this point on Tuesday. The playing field provision is laid down in the Regulations—in this case, the School Premises Regulations, 1967. We laid down minimum standards to be provided at primary and secondary schools. But the Regulations—and I am not talking only about playing fields: I am talking about school building generally—are much simpler than the Regulations which they supplanted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were under considerable pressure by hon. Members, including, incidentally, my hon. Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Mackintosh), who unfortunately is not present, to get away from a system of control by St. Andrew's House, which laid down in the greatest possible detail what should be provided in school buildings in a way which many people, including the education authorities, felt circumscribed and inhibited them in building their schools. They complained, their architects complained, outside architects, hon. Members, and many other people complained that we should get away from that detailed control. That we did, and, having done it, it is not open to hon. Members opposite, who are normally among the most insistent critics of inter-
	<span class='label label-info column'>124</span>
ference, as they call it, from St. Andrew's House, to say, "Why cannot you see that the playing fields at a particular place are well constructed and well maintained?" The primary responsibility for that lies with the education authority. Plenty of advice is available, and we are willing to be helpful when education authorities ask for our help, but we cannot do the job for them; we have no statutory right to do it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If hon. Members want us to amend the Regulations and to lay down detailed controls about playing fields, I am willing to look at that proposition, but I doubt very much whether, such an amendment having been produced, they and education authorities would be willing to accept it. I have made this point more than once, and I cannot repeat it often enough, because it does not seem to have penetrated the mind of, for example, the hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro): there must be a division of responsibility between central Government and local government. I have no intention of taking it upon myself to admit guilt for any inadequacies in this field when this is the responsibility of education authorities. These matters must be pursued at that level, in the first instance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the hon. Member for Ayr agrees with most of what I have said. Perhaps he does not agree with it all. We are not disagreeing about fundamental points. We all want to make improvements, and we have a long way to go in that respect. Some improvement is taking place, and it will continue, but it must be done with some idea of the division between central Government and local government responsibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Under-Secretary of State is right in what he has just said, I wonder why we have this part of the legislation before us. What is its purpose? This pinpoints the worry of some of us about bogus legislation. If we cannot do this anyway, why does this legislation come before Parliament?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another relevant point is this. It was made plain last Tuesday that this was a case of the Department working alongside local authorities. If the Minister is right in what he has just said, I suggest in all seriousness that the inspectors are superfluous and ought to do another job in education. The truth, as we all know,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0518">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>125</span>
is that there is a responsibility here: it is the responsibility of the Inspectorate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also the responsibility of Members of Parliament to act in their second capacity. I think that the Minister has deeply misunderstood the nature of Parliament. Members of Parliament have many rôles. One of them is as so-called legislators. But another rôle, with which I am concerned, is as guardians of public expenditure. This is what our constituents expect of us more and more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister rightly claimed that the Government have spent a great deal more money than was ever spent before on worthwhile projects. I am all for that. I am not making a party political point. However, one cannot at the same time say, "No comment can be made on this". If we are not to act in our rôle as watchdogs of public expenditure as legislation is going through, when else can we do it effectively other than in the Select Committees? I suggest, without being pompous, that many Members of Parliament want to be effective. I am not here this morning just to make a speech; I am here because, like other hon. Members, I jolly well care what happens to my young constituents, who at present do not have adequate recreational facilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is saying that, as Members of Parliament, it is our duty to look at public expenditure, but does my hon. Friend agree, or does he not, that the main responsibility for carrying out detailed plans or leaving work unfinished is with the local authority which started it? Or is it the responsibility of the Government? My hon. Friend is anxious about public expenditure; he says that he does not want to interfere with local authorities; but does he not consider it to be his duty, if he feels this so strongly, to raise with his local authority the question of unfinished work and in this way to discharge his duty?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a pertinent question, because the division of responsibility is muddled. There is a dual responsibility, which was spelt out at our last Sitting by the Minister in all he said about the Inspectorate working on a day-to-day basis. The answer to my hon. Friend the Mem-
	<span class='label label-info column'>126</span>
ber for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Hannan) is to be found in what the Minister said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Largely through the Inspectorate, problems such as this can be dealt with on a day-to-day basis by discussions between the education authority and the Inspectorate …"—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>First Scottish Standing Committee</i>, 4th February, 1969; c. 99.]</p></blockquote>
Who is responsible for the Inspectorate? As I understand it, the Scottish Education Department is responsible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another matter of responsibility. I think that the West Lothian Education Authority is a progressive and imaginative section of the West Lothian County Council. That is my opinion and that of others, but let us be clear who, in the public imagination, bears responsibility for these things. It is the Department as much as anyone else. In the opinion of the headmaster who is my constituent and a member of my constituency Labour Party, a man experienced in public affairs, and in mine, the Department has a considerable share of the responsibility in the example I gave.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not by nature an awkward man. I am not concerned to make myself unpopular; I do not like being unpopular with my colleagues; but since the Minister has not answered my question, I propose to go through the points which were made from the word "go", and to link them with this debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I start by saying, Yes, of course, the Minister was quite right to say that I dared this morning to raise the question of the relationship between national and local government. I repeat again, not only I, but hon. Members opposite, and, indeed, my right hon. Friend the Member for Lanarkshire, North (Miss Herbison), are very concerned that we should be in the position of passing bogus legislation. I do not want to be part of this bogus legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member has said that he wishes to take the matter point by point. I have heard the very phrases and sentences already this morning from the hon. Member. I should not like to charge him with tedious repetition, but he must be careful, if he is going through the matter again point by point, not to lay himself open to the charge of tedious repetition. This is a Parliamentary term which does not really mean "tedious". It is in the Parliamentary sense I am saying it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not tedious repetition so far as other hon. Members are cancerned. May I summarise the point? All right, if Parliament is to pass this kind of legislation, then we must look at the reality of what happens outside Parliament. When we look around we find that the situation is less satisfactory than the picture which has been painted of co-operation between local authorities and the central Government. This is not party political matter. I am not normally critical of my own Ministers, and I acknowledge that a great deal of good work has been done by this Minister and by the Scottish Education Department. That ought to be said, but the question is whether the terms of reference within which we are operating in producing these very expensive playing fields are technically and commercially satisfactory. Can we expect architects to have the resources to do the job properly?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of Order. I understand that we are discussing Amendment No. 6 which proposes to add a subsection to the Clause. The new subsection seeks to place an additional duty upon the local authority. My hon. Friend talks about operating within terms of reference, but we are not deciding that. We are simply deciding whether we should add to the duties of the local authority some powers which we have not yet given to the local authority. I suggest, with great respect to my hon. Friend—and I have great admiration for his tenacity in pursuing these matters—that this is out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The only thing which was out of order was the hon. Member's use of the words "terms of reference". He inadvertently used this phrase instead of the wording of the Amendment. We are debating the Amendment, and not "terms of reference". That is the only point. It is a tautological one really.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In reply to my right hon. Friend, there is a point of substance; that it is possible to do one thing or the other. We can give the job fully to the local authorities, washing our hands of it, and passing by like the Levite. We can say that it is no business of ours and give it entirely to the local authorities and let them get on with it, in which case
	<span class='label label-info column'>128</span>
Parliament should not be talking about it this morning. If the Royal Commission recommends larger units for local authorities, it might be right for Westminster to wash its hands of these considerations and leave them to larger local authorities. That might be an answer, but I would be bothered about this, since we are responsible at the end of the day to the taxpayers for public money, and the buck stops here whether we like it or not. I argue, therefore, that this is not the right answer. The right answer is for Parliament to scrutinise much more carefully what goes through, and it is this function of scrutiny that I am pursuing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can quite accept that the Minister does not want to go into the details of the Roman Catholic primary school at Boghall, Bathgate, nor do I ask him to do so now for that matter can be more satisfactorily dealt with in correspondence, but there are policy conclusions which arise out of what has been said. I dispute the proposition that large sums of money are being wasted in any area of school building, whether on the provision of playing fields or of buildings. I think that this statement is contrary to the facts as I see them and to the experience of very many of us. It is on this ground that I think that my policy conclusions deserve, if not an answer, at least some comment. For example, and it is strictly relevant to the Clause we are discussing——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are not discussing the Clause. We are discussing an Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let the hon. Member go on. That was just a slip of the tongue. It is the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the policy to make sure that there is some kind of cost-effective procedure? The Minister in his reply referred to the 1967 School Buildings Code. I would like to know the extent to which the Department either has the resources to find out or does find out whether local authorities are acting strictly according to this Code. I may be told that the Department is overworked at the present time. I know that there are individuals in the Department who are working extremely hard, but to what extent is the Code followed?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0520">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>129</span>
The Minister gave the game away. He said that improvements had been originated by the central Government. These were his actual words. Most improvements, he claimed, had been originated by the central Government. If it is true, and I believe that it is, who, other than ourselves, will pursue this? This is a point of substance. The Minister said that nothing prevents local authorities. All right, it does not. This argument can be extended 	<i>ad infinitum.</i> Surely this involves positive action rather than negative 	<i>laissez faire.</i> He said that we were arguing desirability. I agree. He went on to talk about statutory duty and said that we cannot impose. If we cannot impose financial scrutiny, I wonder what Parliament can do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The answer is straightforward. The hon. Member is a member of the Public Accounts Committee, which does this. We cannot now go into the question of costing. I draw the attention of the hon. Gentleman to the wording of the Amendment:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… every education authority shall be under a duty</p></blockquote>
That is what we are debating, not the machinery in Parliament for costing jobs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, Mr. Jennings, I respect the Chair. I would just end by raising one point Which was raised by the Minister——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened on both occasions to the speeches of the hon. Gentleman with great interest. We are, in the Amendment, suggesting that there should be an obligation on the local authority to make facilities available. The hon. Gentleman has mentioned the interesting case of the primary school in his constituency where, in his opinion and in the opinion of the headmaster and those locally involved, the facilities are not ready. In relation to this Amendment, will he tell me from his experience whether the obligation is on central Government or on the local authority to determine when these facilities are ready and available for use? This would appear to bring in the relationship between local and central Government. Will he say who would be responsible for saying that the playing fields at the school are ready for use, whether by ratepayers, schoolchildren or anvone else?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>130</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair question. It seems to me that this is a very muddled responsibility, and it is the fact that the division of responsibility is far from clear that bothers me. I have seen the place in company with a chief executive of the contractors who have this job. I have talked to the contractors, to the headmaster and to councillors. In the opinion of the headmaster, the fault and responsibility lie with the Scottish Education Department rather than with the West Lothian County Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the burden of what I am saying, that there is no clear division. When things go wrong, to pass the buck to the local authority simply is not good enough for those who want to see the facilities available rather than to pass laws. When we pass this kind of legislation are we just passing verbiage? The answer is that there is a dual responsibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of Order. My hon. Friend is now saying that to pass legislation is mere verbiage, but what he is and has been discussing are complaints which arise out of previous legislation. Here we are discussing——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My point is that my hon. Friend is arguing on existing legislation. Here we are discussing, as you, Mr. Jennings, have said so often, an Amendment which proposes to extend the use of existing furniture and buildings to the general body of ratepayers. Is it, therefore, in order for my hon. Friend to persist in discussing this matter further?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A point of order is raised and I will answer it. It is not without precedent that hon. Members, in discussing proposed legislation, draw upon their experience of past legislation to illustrate their points. I think that the hon. Member at that moment was in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely, in discussing proposed legislation it would be extremely unwise not to take into account past legislation which may have gone wrong. I say "may". We have passed endless
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0521">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>131</span>
legislation without really having progress chased previous legislation to see where it has got us on the ground. This is a real difficulty with the Government machine at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another great difficulty. It was put to me earlier that I was perhaps over-concerning myself with the Government machine. I plead guilty on this. But it is crazy for Westminster to continue passing all sorts of Acts and to discuss Bills without some relation to what happens in Whitehall or St. Andrew's House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must make it clear again, as I have tried to do throughout the debate, that we are not concerned in the Amendment with the division of responsibility between central and local government. We are dealing with the proposed use by ratepayers of facilities. The whole general principle of what the hon. Member calls policy conclusions should be left to another occasion. I have been very generous in the debate, and I trust that hon. Members—I say this in a most kindly way—will not take advantage. We have had a long and full debate and I am of the opinion that we should be drawing it to a close.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister this morning started, correctly, in my view, by saying that there were two major issues. He said that the second major issue concerned the relationship between national and local government. In this Ruling—you may be absolutely right—you are at variance with the Minister, Mr. Jennings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. No Chairman is unwilling to allow passing references to a general principle such as the division of responsibility between central and local government, but to belabour it in great detail is to make a Second Reading speech rather than to speak to a specific Amendment. That is the point I am trying to emphasise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, it was not a passing reference. It was the second central point in the Minister's speech. But I will not go on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The point is that the Minister did not belabour it at length. That is why I used the phrase "passing reference".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>132</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether length is equated with importance. In my experience of the House of Commons, length is not always equated to importance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear. This is a good illustration of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will make my final point of substance which concerns the Minister's reference, in answer to the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur), on community centres. The Minister claimed that we were spending vastly more than ever before. I ask whether community centres should be related to the expanding authority of local authorities. Should huge community centres—dare I say?—as at Blackburn and Bathgate, be in the hands of smallish education authorities. This is directly relevant to what we are discussing. I should like to see a different kind of legislation on the provision of these facilities which are separate from schools. You have been very patient, Mr. Jennings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. I wonder, Mr. Jennings, whether you could guide me, if not the Committee. I have listened with great interest to my hon. Friend, who has raised matters of extreme importance. There have been, and there are, three living issues in the teaching profession: namely, the functions, powers and responsibilities of inspectors; the interest of the taxpayers; and third, the place of the local authorities. I wonder whether, in view of the difficulty of proceeding along the lines which my hon. Friend was following, it would be in order, on the Question, That the Clause stand part of the Bill, for us to deal with matters of this interest and importance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We will take that Question as and when it comes and then have to see what is in order. Hon. Members will have to use their usual vast and massive ingenuity to raise matters concerned with the functions and powers of inspectors and so on, on other parts of the Bill, if they wish, but I suggest, in ignorance of Scottish affairs, that the Scottish Estimates might provide the appropriate opportunity to do that. That is as far as I can guide the hon. Member now. We will take the Question,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0522">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>133</span>
That the Clause stand part of the Bill, as and when it comes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Brewis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could you help me, Mr. Jennings? In view of the way that the Bill is drafted, will a debate on the Question, That the Clause stand part of the Bill be at the end of Clause 1, which comes on page 3, or will it be at the end of the substituted Section 1, which comes at the top of page 2?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We will carry out the usual practice that I, at any rate, have always followed. It will be at the end of Clause 1. As I see the Bill, Clause 1 ends part of the way down page 3. At that appropriate moment we will take the Question, That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brewis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will you advise me further? I follow what you have just said, but will that enable a very wide debate to take place?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The title of the Clause is "Functions of education authorities". Anything coming within that purview I might look kindly at.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order. We have had very interesting discussions. If we are to debate the functions of education authorities we might find difficulty in finishing the Clause this Session, still less the Bill. As the separate parts of the Clause deal with separate points—for example, fee-paying schools, prescription of standards, and child guidance service—would it be more appropriate to have separate debates on the different Sections being substituted? This would save the Committee's time and help to get the Clause finished before the end of the Session.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The powers of Chairmen are specifically laid down. I remind hon. Members that one power is that the Chairman, if he thinks, in his wisdom or lack of it, that the debates on the various Amendments proposed to a Clause have been wide enough, can refuse a debate on the Question, That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not threatening. I am just reminding hon. Members of the powers that a Chairman has. If
	<span class='label label-info column'>134</span>
debate has been very wide on the Amendments it is within my power to rule that there shall be no debate on the Question, That the Clause stand part of the Bill. Can we now get on?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In direct reply to me the Minister indicated that we on this side, myself in particular, were trying to limit the powers of the local authority in the provision of the recreational facilities that we all want to see in Scotland. I view the matter this way. As Minister, the hon. Gentleman has two duties, and we, as Members of Parliament, are here to back him up. First, it is his duty to guide and encourage local authorities to provide the facilities which we all think are necessary. A local authority, entirely of its own volition, may make up its mind about the facilities that it wants to provide. In a particular instance the Minister may say that a school will have three football pitches. He has made up his mind, and the local authority goes ahead to provide those three pitches with the approval and authority of the inspectors and the Scottish Education Department. But then the Minister has a very important function. It is up to him to see that those three football pitches which are provided are of sufficiently good standard. That is where the responsibilities lie and where the Minister is entirely muddled on the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, if no one else at the end of the debate, am a very much wiser man than when we began. I opened the debate by saying that I was sure it could be pretty brief, because most of the points had already been covered. However, such is the frailty of us all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful for the way in which the Minister has tried to respond to the Amendment. Had I been prepared to be satisfied with a negative attitude to the provision of these facilities, I would be more than satisfied with his replies. I believe that he has gone about as far as he can in showing good will and a desire for these things to be done, taking a purely negative attitude. But I am not entirely satisfied. I believe that a change is needed to a positive and direct attitude in the provision of these facilities. I should like to come back to this matter later, if possible, and I give notice to the Minister now so that he can think about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0523">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>135</span>
We nave had an excellent debate and covered matters very fully. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 7, in page 2, line 19, leave out from beginning to 'an' in line 21.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will be for the convenience of the Committee if, with this Amendment, we take Amendment No. 9, in page 3, line 16, leave out subsection (3).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have now reached the most controversial part of the Bill. The Government are proposing to remove the right of local authorities to charge fees in certain schools. This may seem to some a small question. The schools are few, but it is not their number that matters. Edinburgh and Glasgow are the only local authorities resisting the Government's intent. But, as I say, it is not the number of local authorities that matters. What matters most is that two principles are at stake: the principle of freedom of choice in education, and the principle of the rights of a local education authority to shape the pattern of education in its area. Edinburgh and Glasgow are the two local authorities resisting the Government's proposals. Their resistance, as ours, does not spring primarily from the question whether fees should or should not be charged. What they, as we, seek to defend is the character and quality of these schools which have made so large a contribution to the excellence of Scottish education as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his speech at the end of our Second Reading debate the Minister said that I had
	<br><blockquote><p>"kept talking about the unique character of these schools and the unique contribution that they had made to Scottish education."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 21st January, 1969; Vol. 776, c. 378.]</p></blockquote>
I did not say that, but I do not complain, because we are accustomed to the irrelevance and arrogance of Ministerial replies in the House. The Minister was more concerned that day with his diversion in studying "Who's Who", his 	<i>vade mecum</i>
	<span class='label label-info column'>136</span>
in Whitehall, than he was with answering questions which were seriously put during a serious debate. In fairness to the hon. Gentleman, I must say that that alleged quotation was the best part of his speech. I might not have used the word "unique" twice, but I believe that these schools have character and value, and that their contribution to Scottish education has been an important one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What matters now is that Edinburgh and Glasgow wish to preserve these schools as part of the local educational structure. That is the considered view of these democratically elected people. I cannot accept that the Government have any right to steamroller these two great cities into a meek compliance with the questionable and unproved Socialist dogma which oozes, not so much from Whitehall, as from Transport House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In passing, may I say that I am disappointed that the Scottish Nationalists and the Liberal Party, who pretend to be the champions of local decision and local authority, have reneged on their so-called principles. Now we see them revealed as they are, sheep in sheep's clothing, bleating Socialism, and encouraging this discredited Government in their attempt to crush local democracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the reality of the Bill. It is an attempt to crush local democracy, which is one of the two principles which we on this side of the Committee are seeking to defend this morning. My hon. Friends and I believe that local education authorities must be allowed at least a certain discretion in shaping the form of local education. The Government first pretended—and I remember their pretence in our debate in the Scottish Grand Committee—that their approach was one of reasonable consultation. As soon as they found that Edinburgh and Glasgow would not bow to their will, the masquerade was changed. Instead, we had the reality of compulsion. The Bill proves that the Government had made up their mind in advance of the so-called consultations. This Clause gives statutory authority to the Government to override, to crush, the wishes of local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second principle which we are defending is perhaps even more important. It is the principle of freedom of choice in education, a freedom which is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0524">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>137</span>
enshrined in the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights. Are hon. Gentlemen opposite going to be selective about the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights? Are they going to discard those parts of it which do not conveniently fit in with Socialist doctrine? That is what they are doing. They are removing part of parents' freedom of choice in education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that this is only a beginning. If we allow this proposal to go through unchallenged the squeeze which we have already experienced so sharply, the squeeze on the grant-aided schools, will be intensified. Hon. Gentlemen opposite showed by their thoughtless cheers the other day that the independent schools will be next on the list, and that they, too, may well be sacrificed in this bogus cause of egalitarianism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These schools charge fees which are not high. They range up to £23 a year in Glasgow, and up to £44 a year in Edinburgh.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Small</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Gate money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe that fees of that order restrict education at these schools to the children of the rich, as some would have us believe. A sum of £23 a year is not much compared with the large sums spent by people today on smoking, on gambling, on drinking, on television, on driving, and on leisure generally. The sacrifice which they are called upon to make in Glasgow is the equivalent of two packets of cigarettes a week. The Minister may regard that as socially divisive. I do not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see no reason why parents who are prepared to pay these fees—and I accept that the fees could well be larger, but I would hope that if they were there would be even more free places in these schools than there are now—should not be allowed to do so. Further, I believe that parents who wish to make this contribution towards the education of their children are demonstrating a special quality of involvement in their children's education, and that, I believe, is helpful to the child, and helpful to the whole process of education itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A moment ago I mentioned the free places in these schools. This is another
	<span class='label label-info column'>138</span>
reason why the schools should be preserved. Some loose comparisons have been made between grant-aided schools in Scotland and direct-grant schools in England. We have been reminded—as we were by the Secretary of State for Scotland when he opened the debate the other day—that local authority fee-paying schools were abolished in England in 1944. The fact that they were abolished in England is not in itself a good reason for abolishing them in Scotland. I do not approve of this sinister move towards the blending together of Scottish and English educational practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have a classic example of it this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sir?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have a classic example of that here now, the perfect blending this morning of the Chair and the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That blending is of particular pleasure to us all, and if I thought that a wider and more general blending would have the same happy consequence for you, Mr. Jennings, and for us all, I might well revise the principle which I pronounced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difference is that the Regulations which stemmed from the 1944 Act placed on local authorities in England and Wales a requirement that at least one-quarter of the places in the direct-grant schools should be provided free. In Scotland, on the other hand, there is no such obligation on the grant-aided school. Therefore, what the local authority fee-paying schools provide through their free places—and I wish there were more of them—is something towards the creation of a middle sector in education which exists in England but does not exist to anything like the same extent in Scotland. I told the House the other day, and I repeat it now, that the reforming zeal of those egalitarians opposite is not levelling anyone up. What they are doing is denying to poorer parents the freedom of choice in education, which all of us should be seeking to provide for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not primarily the fees themselves to which the Government object. What they object to is the principle of selectivity. They object to the fact that these schools are selective. It was interesting,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0525">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

during the earlier part of this Committee stage, to hear the Minister declare that he recognises that selection is necessary in all forms of education. That was indeed a change, because until that moment he had given the impression throughout Scotland that he regarded every form of selectivity as a sin to be got rid of. Now we know that he supports the principle of selectivity in education, but, in fairness to him, because this is an important matter and I must not misquote him, I must say that he has an objection to a certain form of selectivity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister objects to selectivity at set ages, and his objection to this is so strong, his hatred of selection by merit is so great, that he proposes to stamp out these fine schools and so deny educational choice to poorer families. Rich parents can look elsewhere, because they can afford to do so. There are many who cannot afford to look elsewhere. Theirs will be Hobson's choice if the Minister has his way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was suggested—not in the House, but outside—that these local authority fee-paying schools were snob schools, a way in which the rich could get subsidised, cheap, privileged education for the children. I went through the parental occupations of one complete entry of 70 pupils into one of these fee-paying schools, a very famous one indeed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>140</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a big difference between Perthshire and Argyllshire and any rural district in Scotland, and the great Cities of Edinburgh and Glasgow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to be asked that question because it gives me an opportunity to develop the point. The argument for comprehensive education is stronger in country districts such as Perthshire and Argyll than it is in cities like Edinburgh and Glasgow, although comprehensive education has an important place there. The argument is more compelling in the country districts because of the nature of the community. There is a larger mix in the country than in the city, where people tend to congregate much more by class. But I will not pursue the argument further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If hon. Gentlemen opposite wish to examine the social mix which exists I suggest that they look at the fee-paying schools in the two cities. These are the occupations of the parents: company director, police constable, pharmaceutical assistant, journalist, traveller, bookseller, draughtsman, solicitor, housewife, widow, another company director, inspector, welder, insurance inspector, civil engineer, inspector, doctor, teacher, mechanical engineer, joiner and widow. I have read a complete section from a list which I have seen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Small</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No Labour M.P.s.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, but, happily, among their ex-pupils is a Tory hon. Member whom we welcome here today. The list which I have read shows the wide social mix which exists in these schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Gentlemen opposite have argued that because parents do not pay the full cost of this education they are being subsidised by the taxpayer and ratepayer. It is curious to hear Socialists objecting to subsidies. It is more surprising, however, to consider the illogicality and inconsistency of the argument advanced on Second Reading by the Minister and those of his supporters who spoke.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, why should these schools be singled out from the vast range of tax-financed services which are not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0526">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>141</span>
enjoyed personally by everybody? In the debate the other day I asked how hon. Gentlemen opposite could advance that argument and at the same time require taxpayers in the Borders to pay through taxation, towards the railway deficit when their trains had been removed from them. I asked why the Minister did not object to everybody paying, through taxation, towards the cost of the Concorde airliner when few would have the privilege of travelling supersonically. I ask the Minister to apply his argument to the universities. If he wishes to be consistent he should immediately make the universities nonselective. There should be no examinations because of the hurt to those who fail: there should be degrees for all in a mad academic caucus race in which everyone is first, with prizes for all. If, on the other hand, the Minister regards this proposal as absurd, as it is, then there is only one other course open to him if he is to be consistent; and that is that every parent should pay the full cost of his child's university education. Or, if he dislikes that proposition, then the parents of all those children who do not go to university should at once receive a special tax rebate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister advance any of these courses? Of course not. The fact that he does not underlines the absurdity of his narrow argument, which shows that hon. Gentlemen opposite do not regard freedom of choice in education as a desirable service for the community. That is why they advance this bogus subsidy argument. They believe that it is not a desirable thing, whereas we do. They trample on the U.N. Declaration of Human Rights whereas we uphold it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people in Edinburgh and Glasgow regard that freedom as very desirable indeed. In Glasgow there were recently 70 places in the secondary department of a fee-paying school. There were 250 applications. In Edinburgh there were 308 applicants for 70 secondary places. Those who succeed are selected by merit, and the others fail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not much freedom of choice, is there?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am all for fun, but we have to keep our fun within the limits of order, and there must
	<span class='label label-info column'>142</span>
not be interventions from a sedentary position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise again, Mr. Jennings. May I ask the hon. Gentleman to explain where the freedom of choice lies in the two cases he mentioned?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Where is the freedom of choice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. william</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. If out of 308 applicants only 70 were selected, where is the freedom of choice</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman is really suggesting that there should be more places in local authority fee-paying schools. There were 70 places available in those instances and their availability was publicly advertised in the newspapers. The parents of any child had the right to apply, and many did. I accept that only 70 places were available. It follows—and here I provide the right hon. Gentleman with another blinding truth—that those who did not succeed failed because they did not get places. I accept that this failure to win one of these places produces some tension and much disappointment, although the hon. Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Mackintosh) exaggerated the situation absurdly the other day. Those children who do not succeed—the 238 of the 308 who applied in one case—and who do not get into a fee-paying school are not branded for life as failures, as hon. Gentlemen opposite pretend. They receive excellent education somewhere else, perhaps in an independent or grant-aided school or, more likely, in one of the Scottish public schools for which my admiration is no less than the Minister's.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difference between the two sides of the Committee is that I do not believe that comprehensive education, excellent as it often is, should be forced on local authorities to the exclusion of everything else. Fee-paying schools can and should continue to exist if that is the wish of local authorities. I am, therefore, glad to repeat the undertaking which was clearly given by my right hon. Friend on Second Reading, that if the Secretary of State makes an order under Clause I, we shall rescind it and restore to local education authorities, if they want it, the power to set up fee-paying schools again. This is a clear and unequivocal pledge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0527">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>143</span>
It has been suggested that local authority fee-paying schools deprive non fee-paying schools in two ways: first, because they cream off the ablest pupils and so lower the average ability at the other schools; and, secondly, that their high reputation and the ability of their pupils attract more and better teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the first point, I accept that the children are able. That is the criterion by which they are selected. Equally, the children come from a very wide area indeed, and, in the case of these two cities, from well outside their boundaries. One may wonder if there would be much difference in the many non fee-paying schools if they were spread out among them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the second point, teachers are certainly attracted by the high reputation of these schools. However, they are equally attracted by the many schools in the non fee-paying sector which also have a high reputation of excellence. There are many non fee-paying schools with a high academic reputation, which encourage educational experiment, which have fine buildings and whose pupils have alert and inquiring minds. These are the qualities which teachers seek. These qualities are far more important to the good teacher than whether or not a school is fee-paying. It is these marks of excellence for which a good teacher looks, and while he will find them in the fee-paying school, he will also find them elsewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alex Eadie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that selection is based on ability and suggests that in the ordinary State school it would be a good idea to have a similar social mix. Is he arguing that the social mix in the State school should also be based on ability?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot understand the hon. Gentleman's question and I think that he has got me wrong. I support and encourage a wide social mix ir schools of every kind. The local authority fee-paying school selects by merit. That is part of its structure. I argue that there is a large social mix in such schools Hon. Gentlemen opposite have not grasped this point. There is far more of a mix of all sorts in fee-paying schools than there would be if those school; were turned into comprehensive territorial schools, because then they would
	<span class='label label-info column'>144</span>
draw their pupils from a much narrower social grouping than they do at present.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been suggestions that the staff-pupil ratio in the local authority fee-paying schools is better than that in the non fee-paying schools. There is no evidence of this. For the last 50 years, local authorities have been bound by the clear requirement in the 1918, 1945 and 1962 Acts that the provision of fee-paying schools must be without prejudice to the non fee-paying schools for which the focal education authorities are responsible. No one has yet suggested that any local authority in Scotland has ever been in breach of that Statute. If it is argued that the dice has been loaded by the local education authorities in favour of the fee-paying schools, that is tantamount to declaring that those local education authorities have been in breach of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0528">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>145</span>
Statute. I am convinced that no right hon. or hon. Member present would dream of making a charge of that kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned that one of the distinctive features of the fee-paying schools is that the pupils come from so wide a social range and so large a geographical area. It follows that if these schools were to be made into territorial schools, which may well be the Government's intent, they would become far more socially divisive than they are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have again read the whole of the Second Reading debate. I have searched in vain for arguments which seem to make sense in support of the Governments proposal. I remind the Minister that it is for him to prove his case. The schools exist and no one has yet questioned the quality of education which they provide. We all agree that they provide a very good education indeed. It is not the quality of education which is in question. It is significant that on Second Reading and so far in this Committee everyone has accepted that these are good schools. Yet the Under-Secretary of State proposes to get rid of them and to pluck out from the structure of Scottish education a group of schools which have made a great contribution to the distinction and excellence of Scottish education, which is respected all over the world.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of information, does the hon. Gentleman know whether the Leader of the Opposition and the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Handsworth (Sir E. Boyle), should they be successful at the next general election, will introduce legislation to make it possible for English local education authorities to charge fees in schools?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that is most unlikely. The hon. Gentleman may believe that it is a good idea to bring the two systems into line. I do not believe that it is. The fact is that these schools exist in Scotland and they are doing well. They make a large contribution to Scottish education, and I see no reason why we should get rid of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman in the first part of his speech, set great store by the fact, as he suggested, that a fundamental principle is
	<span class='label label-info column'>146</span>
involved, namely, freedom of choice for parents. Is that principle, if we accept his formulation of it, to apply only in Scotland under a Conservative regime, or is to apply in England as well?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to have to go back to an earlier part of my speech. I explained that the local authority fee-paying schools in Scotland provide something approaching a middle sector of education which exists much more widely in England and Wales, because following the abolition of the fee-paying schools in 1944 the Regulations concerning the organisation of the direct-grant schools in England and Wales laid down that a quarter of the places should be provided free. In Scotland there is no such requirement on grant-aided schools, and local authority fee-paying schools, where they exist in Edinburgh and Glasgow, (provide something approaching this. I should like to see many more free places provided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has spoken about the excellence and records of the fee-paying schools. If there are good teachers in these schools and in the hon fee-paying schools—and, incidentally, the teachers have gone through exactly the same training courses—if that size of the classes is no different, and if the non fee-paying school is as well equipped as the fee paying school—all of which I accept—what makes the fee-paying schools so excellent?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not claim that these are the only excellent schools. I have tried deliberately to make it clear that there are many excellent schools. I will try to answer the right hon. Gentleman's very interesting question, which I welcome. I believe that these schools are excellent, or at least that they have a special quality which is desirable in education, because the children who attend them are selected by merit, which I know hon. Members opposite regard as disgraceful. Secondly, the existence of fees makes parents that much more involved in their child's education, and that is important. Education does not begin when a child goes to school in the morning and end when he leaves in the afternoon. As the Secretary of State said, education is an integrated process; it goes on all the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0529">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>147</span>
time. What is important in that process is the extent of the parents' interest in the education of their child. I believe that the payment of a fee is a pledge of that interest. It is a demonstration of involvement. I see no reason why parents who are prepared to pay those fees should be prevented from doing so by the Government. Another reason why I believe these schools have a special character is that a far higher proportion of the pupils at them go right through a full course without the disruption which can be caused when there is a variety of leaving dates for different children in the school. That has a stabilising influence on the process of education in those schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One might also add that we should seek to defend tradition. Tradition is important. Certainly these schools have fine traditions, going back over as many as eight centuries. But we seek to defend them, not because they have fine traditions, but because they are good schools in themselves, because they play an important rôle in Scottish education, and because the local authorities responsible for them wish to keep them in being.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, and in contributions made outside the House, there has been a great parade of dogma by hon. Members opposite—and by right hon. Members opposite, too, alas. Yet it is for the Government to establish their case. They have not yet provided a clear and comprehensive reason for the abolition of these schools. They have said that they believe that these schools cannot work alongside the comprehensive system. They have said local authority fee-paying schools and comprehensive schools are incompatible. I do not accept that, and that is where we differ. There is room for a variety of education in Scotland, and fee-paying schools contribute importantly to the provision of that variety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we have heard from hon. Members opposite is argument which springs from dogma. I do not object to dogma, although I do not agree with this particular dogma. However, we have also heard arguments which are uglier because they spring from envy. We have heard
	<span class='label label-info column'>148</span>
arguments which are questionable and unproved. Throughout we have had frightening remonstrations of the Socialist arrogance which believes that the central Government always knows best.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two principles are at stake today: the principle of freedom of choice in education, and the principle of the right of democratically-elected representatives in the two great cities of Edinburgh and Glasgow to shape local education as they and the people they represent think best. I know that hon. Members opposite make light of our belief that the principle of freedom of choice in education is involved. I assure them that it is. We must warn people in Scotland that, even if they are not concerned with the survival and future of the local authority fee-paying schools in Edinburgh and Glasgow, we are seeing the beginning of an assault on the structure of education itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are already putting a strong economic squeeze on the grant-aided schools. Its extent has not yet struck the Scottish public mind. Goodness me, it will. We know from the reaction of hon. Members opposite throughout the debate on 21st January how they loathe independence in education and would scrap the independent schools if they could. What hon. Members opposite seek to do is to impose on Scotland—and, I dare say, on England—a uniform system of education, with no choice and no freedom, dictated by a questionable and unproved political theory in Transport House. That is where it all begins. I accept that there is also a very important place for the comprehensive principle in Scotland where comprehensive education has been part of our structure for generations. That will grow and develop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to the second principle, namely, the right of a local authority to shape education in its own area. Glasgow and Edinburgh were not genuinely consulted about this matter, except perhaps in the early stages. They have had pressure put on them throughout these discussions by the Minister. They have been told, "Conform or else". This Bill is the result, this Clause is the reality. That is the second good reason why my hon. Friends
