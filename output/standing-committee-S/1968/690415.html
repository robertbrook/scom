	<div class='clause'>Clause 2</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>PREPARATION OF STRUCTURE PLANS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. N. R. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 3, in page 4, line 13, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>(8) The provisions of this section shall apply to any joint planning authority established foi the purpose of preparing a structure plan under the provisions of section 2 of the Act of 1947.</p></blockquote>
This proposed new subsection refers to the provisions of Section 2 of the principal Act and it raises once again, as was indicated on the last occasion, when we discussed Clause 1, the underlying problem which arises when statutory obligations are imposed in the absence of adequate machinery for carrying them out. I am conscious of the observations which fell from your lips, Mr. Brewis, when we debated the Motion, "That Clause 1 stand part of the Bill" and I will, therefore, take up no more time except to emphasise one fundamental inherent problem—the nature of the duties imposed, and the inadequacy of local planning authorities to cope with them. The Minister of State indicated last time the Committee met that there were a number of planning authorities in existence now which might be able to fulfil these functions, although he was unable to give any indication as to when or which planning authorities would have these duties imposed upon them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Amendment is really aimed at that large batch of local planning authorities who could be said to fall into the category of authorities already capable of fulfilling the functions set out in Clause 1 or Clause 2 of this Bill. Once these parts of the Bill are applied to any area or group of authorities, the problem might to some
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
extent be resolved by having resort to the amalgamation provisions in the principal Act, because, under Clause 102(2) of this Bill, it is provided that this Bill and the 1947 Act shall have effect as if this Bill were part of that Act. So, once we have the situation where Part I of this Bill is applied to an area, the provisions of Section 2 and the First Schedule to the 1947 Act come into play.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be recalled that Section 2 of the principal Act does make possible the amalgamation of a number of local authorities for any of the purposes of this Bill. In other words, that amalgamation can be brought about either on a voluntary basis or under subsection (3) by order of the Secretary of State. That provision requires that there shall be a public inquiry and it is not a power which the Secretary of State would be likely readily to resort to; but the First Schedule to the 1947 Act makes it quite clear that the joint planning committee set up, or any committee so established, can have delegated to it a wide range of functions. Indeed, paragraph 4 of the First Schedule states that the Secretary of State can make such a committee a body corporate, and Part III deals with the situation where joint advisory committees are set up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So, the real reason of this Amendment is that, in advance of having these duties imposed, it may be necessary for a group of authorities to get together to work out the details of a survey and what is called a structure plan; but till Part I of this Bill is put into effect there will be no statutory powers for the authorities to get together for this purpose, there would be a purely 	<i>ad hoc</i> arrangement. This Amendment seeks to give a group of local authorities power to get together for the purpose of preparing what is now called a structure plan. Let us remember that the structure plan is a new thing, not found in the 1947 Act, and Part I must be applied before local authorities can be combined under the provisions of Section 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Amendment is also put forward partly in the nature of a probe because we should like to know how the grouping of the smaller authorities, quite distinct from the larger authorities which we discussed last time, will be treated. This Amendment gives power to local authorities, and particularly those of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0849">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>53</span>
smaller kind, for the purpose of getting together to prepare structure plans. Having got together for that purpose and got themselves organised, then it would be appropriate to impose these duties on them. Yet nothing is more ridiculous than to impose these obligations on quite minute authorities without first having grouped them together so that they can meet their responsibilities under this Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Dr. J. Dickson Mabon)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the hon. and learned Gentleman not only put his case well, but answered it equally well. Anybody who wants to appreciate the application of this Amendment to this Bill could readily read the answer in what he has said about its being, in effect, unnecessary. We are dealing here with the substantive point he made towards the end of his speech which I thought was a re-questioning of what went on at our last Sitting about the grouping of authorities and the application of Part 1 of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have said on at least two, or perhaps three, occasions that under Clause 102 we should apply different appointed days for different local authorities and any number of different days may be so appointed for the coming into operation of the provisions of the Bill in different areas. There is no question of the Bill coming into operation for everybody at the same time. If the hon. and learned Member would be kind enough to look at my last reply in our proceedings—it is recorded in columns 45, 46 and 47 of the OFFICIAL REPORT dated 1st April—he will see that I said I could not anticipate which authorities will take advantage of the obligations in this Bill and the second Section of the 1947 Act. It is too early to say that. What we hope for is that they will come together on a voluntary and co-operative basis, and in that connection I can assure the Committee that there is a good deal of good will—and the hon. and learned Gentleman must not underestimate it—among authorities for coming together. There is also a great deal of work for them to do, so that if this Part of the Bill applies to them, they will be able to go through the necessary stages without delay. But, press me as he may, I cannot tell the hon. and learned Gentleman
	<span class='label label-info column'>54</span>
in what sequence groupings will emerge, or over what period. I do not know, although I am very hopeful that we shall get some of these structure plans into being long before the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Scottish Local Government are applied in Statute form. That is the purpose of the exercise here—that we should apply the provisions of this Bill before any recommendations of the Royal Commission come into effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that this is a difficult operation and that it is not something which the Minister of State can speak about in detail in advance, but the legal point is that a group of authorities must be got together for creating a structure plan; but that can be done only after Part I is applied. Let me put it this way. This can be done only when Part I is in operation but that Part has to be read alongside the provisions of the 1947 Act. We have this statutory provision in the 1947 Act for amalgamations and the setting up of joint planning authorities or committees, but the situation as I envisage it is, what will happen at the earlier stage before Part I is applied. We shall want planning authorities to come together. This can be done on a purely 	<i>ad hoc</i> basis, as I have already suggested, with no legal sanction behind it, but if we accepted this Amendment it could be done under the provisions of Section 2 of the 1947 Act. The structure plan—and the amalgamations would be only for the limited purpose of providing structure plans—could be made under the provisions of the Amendment whereas it could not be done at the moment because Part I does not apply. This Amendment builds into the Section the power to invoke Section 2 of the 1947 Act for the limited purpose of getting amalgamations on a limited basis prior to the preparation of struoture plans. I appreciate that the Minister of State, may need time to consider this, although our Amendment has been tabled for some time now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have discussed this with some of my colleagues at the Bar familiar with planning matters, and it seems that something along these lines would be desirable if we are to get proper statutory amalgamations, for the purpose of preparing a structure plan before the duties are imposed. The converse is to wait till the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0850">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>55</span>
duties are imposed and then try to get amalgamations. That seems less satisfactory than creating a statutory power to get the amalgamations for this limited purpose. I hope that the Minister will think about this, because he did not really answer that point earlier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Dickson Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I realise that we are having a bad start this morning. I will try again. The hon. and learned Gentleman knows the names of the authorities which are holding meetings with me now, or later, after they have held their own meetings, to discuss various structure plans affecting limited areas. The areas can be as small as the Cumbernauld, Stepps, Kirkintilloch, Lennoxtown, Bishopbriggs area, or they can be as large as the Cylde area. The point I want to make is that we want to do nothing to stop these immensely good-natured meetings going on. There is a lot of good will in them and they are beginning to do the work. As I mentioned to my hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge and Airdrie (Mr. Dempsey), Lanarkshire is the one country which can quite reasonably say that it has an outline and structure plan already. The hon. Gentleman's Amendment is unnecessary; there is power in the Bill already.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the question of the chicken and the egg—which comes first. The hon. and learned Gentleman is saying that we must have some provision in the Bill allowing this thing to happen legally. What I am saying is that we have 	<i>ad hoc</i> committees going on, and, when they reach the stage of wanting to apply the provisions in the Bill, we will be in a position to oblige.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that we do not want to do anything to impede this. If we applied these Clauses by order under Clause 102 of the Bill—and we can apply Section 2 of the 1947 Act to Clause 102—it is then all a question of at what stage we will go through the formalities of consultations in the light of there being an authority which can produce, legally, a structure plan. I am satisfied that the Bill will enable us to apply this to those areas willing to produce a structure plan quite soon. The hon. and learned Gentleman is right to be concerned, but if I were to proceed along the lines he is suggesting and provide a provision like this I might be in serious danger of
	<span class='label label-info column'>56</span>
appearing to say to these authorities, on behalf of the Government, "We do not want you to do anything till we apply it" and that is not true. We want them to get on with their work. I have some dates in June and some even in May. I have meetings with the Clyde Valley Planning Advisory Committee in June, and with the Falkirk Joint Planning Advisory Committee and Stirling County in June. There are other matters also and I would not like to see these meetings postponed till this Bill received the Royal Assent and we could bring in an order confirming the application of these provisions. The last thing we want is delay. The way we are doing this is the right way to avoid delay, and I cannot see that any provision similar to that contained in the Amendment would be helpful. I am sorry to have to say so; I genuinely want to be helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that I have explained my position. I am not asking for delay. There is nothing in this Amendment which would prevent the existing arrangements from carrying on on an 	<i>ad hoc</i> basis. What the Minister cannot do at the moment is to invoke Section 2 of the 1947 Act, till he has applied Part I of this Measure. Far from seeking to delay progress I am trying to enable him to invoke this Section 2 of the 1947 Act before he invokes Part I. Let him carry on with all the 	<i>ad hoc</i> consultations and arrangements that he wants. If he will not consider this, then I cannot withdraw the Amendment, but will allow it to be negatived.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I seek some information and clarification. According to the Bill, the structure plan will be accompanied by diagrammatic illustrations. The structure plan with its illustrations is not related to any Ordnance Survey sheet, and will not show the actual boundaries of areas. This will mean that at the structure plan stage a person will be unable to find out, with any degree of certainty, whether or not his property is affected. This will be so, unless a local plan is produced at the same time because the structure plan is subject to the approval of the Secretary of State while
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0851">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>57</span>
the local plan is not. If anyone believes that he has any objections he would of necessity have to make them at the structure plan stage—it will be his only opportunity, since the local plan is not subject to the Secretary of State's approval. I do not think that this is the intention of the Bill, but if I am correct, it means that inevitably there will be many more objections at structure plan stage, simply to safeguard an applicant's interests. I hope that I am wrong in this and I hope that the Minister will ease my mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like Clause 1, this Clause is one of the crucial Clauses in the Bill. The structure plan, this new idea of regional planning, is, we are told, to comprise a written statement. That written statement will be supplemented by various things, such as diagrams, illustrations and descriptive matter. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Bridgeton (Mr. James Bennett) is absolutely correct when he says that this approach is liable to generate opposition, sometimes quite needlessly. That opposition is liable to be generated the more so unless some detail is given by way of maps or otherwise as to exactly what is comprehended in the structure plan. This applies, doubly so, to the so-called action area, which we discussed at Second Reading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister tell us what the Government have in mind when they use the expressions "structure plan" "written statement" "action area" and so forth? In what context will diagrams be used? Will they be approximate layout plans, or will they be the sort of diagrams which might give some rough indication as to the type of structure that will be used? What are the illustrations he has in mind? The Clause talks about descriptive matter. Figure 1 of the Report of the Planning Advisory Group gives an example of a diagram or a map showing a structure plan for an urban area—or it would appear that that is what it is intended to show. If this is the case, I can see a great deal of concern being generated at the earliest stage of the planning process. There is no Ordnance Survey document, there are no streets or other indications. Is this the sort of plan with which the structure plan will be illustrated? The structure plan is a written statement, and the maps and
	<span class='label label-info column'>58</span>
diagrams are purely supplementary to it. Why should the structure plan be primarily a written statement? Will it be supplemented with the kind of map—the word "map" is not actually used in this Clause—which lets people know whether their property will be affected?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My main concern on this Clause has to do with the action area procedure. As far as I can see from the illustrations in Figure 1 of the Planning Advisory Group Report, an action area is something with a circle round it and a number. Even the term "action area" is liable to alert people. If they live anywhere near that circle there will be a great deal of concern, probably resulting in opposition to the plan. Subsection (5) goes on to provide for a local map being prepared for the selected area as a whole, that is the action area. What does the Minister have in mind for this local map? Will it show the affected streets? There are the kinds of practical matters which will affect the operation of this legislation, and the new planning procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that one cannot spell out in too much detail exactly what will be done, that it has to be left in general terms, but we ought to be told at this stage exactly what is involved in the written statement. What things will be embodied in it? How will the action area concept be approached? How will it be indicated on the local plan referred to in subsection (5), and how are all these proposals to be supplemented by the diagrams, illustrations and descriptive matter?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where does the Countryside Commission fit into all this? The structure plan is inevitably comprehensive, but the Countryside Act, 1967, imposed certain statutory duties upon the Countryside Commission. It is obliged to give advice when called upon, both to the Secretary of State and local planning authorities. There is a statutory duty on the Commission to give advice and help to the Secretary of State and to local planning authorities where it is asked to do so, but should not we be requiring some kind of consultation between local planning authorities and the Commission, at least when we are dealing with the structure plan phase? It is difficult to envisage a structure plan in a county area which did not cut across the bows of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0852">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>59</span>
Countryside Commission. Appreciating that this is a new statutory body, and that it has not really got into its swing, one gets the impression that the relationship between the Commission, the Secretary of State, and local planning authorities is not at the moment all that it might be. Although these are perhaps teething problems, I understand that in a public inquiry that is being considered in Scotland at the moment there has not been the degree of consultation with the Commission that might have been desirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder whether we should get into this structure plan Clause a statutory obligation on the planning authority at least to inform the Commission of what is going on. It may be that that is provided for in the Countryside (Scotland) Act. If it is, no doubt the Minister will tell us, but if it is not I think that this new concept of the structure plan contained in this very important Clause should include a provision for consultation with the Commission, because the two are likely to overlap.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are some observations on the Clause which seem to be pertinent, and I am sure that the Committee will want to know in some detail exactly what is involved in the various terms and expressions used.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. J. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can we be certain that the expenditure of time, money, and labour on Glasgow's existing 29 C.D.A.s will not be wasted, in other words that the Clause will not have an adverse effect on what has been done so far in respect of C.D.A.s? Glasgow is in a unique position because of the redevelopment that is going on, and one must appreciate that Glasgow is in a special position with regard to finance because of these areas. May we have a firm assurance that the present arrangements will continue despite what is in the Clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Bridgeton (Mr. James Bennett) in his remarks at our first Sitting, reported at col. 17, complimented the authors of the Planning Advisory Group on their Report, and I think rightly. My hon. Friend has asked one or two questions on one of the fundamental points about the Group's recommendations. Before I acknowledge that and deal with what was said by the
	<span class='label label-info column'>60</span>
hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie), I ought to say that as a result of his speech, and the speeches of other hon. Members complaining that not sufficient representation was made in time by the Glasgow Corporation, my noble Friend the Under-Secretary of State arranged to meet Glasgow Corporation, and I have here the minute of a meeting which took place on 8th April. We took advantage of the Recess to try to get this matter settled. It is a long minute, and I shall not refer to all the different sections of it. The deputation was pleased to be received and to get assurances about the five major points that it raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first point was about comprehensive development areas, and we looked carefully at Schedule 9 in particular. I agree that this Schedule is a bit further on from the part of the Bill now under discussion, but it is still relevant to this Clause. We are looking into some of the points that were made to make sure that there is no flaw in any of the transitional and savings provisions in the later Schedules. If any further outline C.D.A.s were about to be presented for approval when a commencement order bringing Part I into effect for Glasgow was under consideration, we would discuss with the Corporation the timing of that order. We are as anxious as Glasgow is not to have any delay in the submission of C.D.A.s and not to allow the transition between the present Statute and the proposed statute to be an irritant. The Corporation was pleased to get the assurance that it would be consulted by us on the application of Part I as it affected Glasgow at any time, but the Government must govern. If the Government think that Part I ought to be applied, they must make that decision. We shall consult Glasgow Corporation, but that does not mean that the Corporation has a right of veto over anything that we propose. I do not think that the Committee would expect the Government to submit to such an arrangement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am as concerned as I know my noble Friend and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State are about the slowing down in the submission of C.D.A.s. I think that my hon. Friend shares that view, particularly with regard to Bridge-ton-Dalmarnock, which is costing the city about 2,000 houses a year. I hope that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0853">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>61</span>
Glasgow Corporation will speed up its submission of C.D.A.s. Whether it will be its policy to hold back C.D.A.s is a matter to be made clear. There have been one or two ominous noises about that, but I hope that my hon. Friend will encourage the city, it having got this assurance about the application of the Bill to C.D.A.s, to make sure that it puts into practice what it claims it believes in theory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the general argument about Clause 2, I should not dream of seeking to argue the whole of the Planning Advisory Group's Report. One has to look carefully at the whole Report, and not just at part of it. The hon. and learned Member for Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) referred to Figure 1 of the Report, which is an attempt to show what an urban structure map would be. I take the point about the Countryside Commission. In Figure 2 one can see the form of the county map that is suggested, but I want the Committee to go further. If one looks at action areas, both for improvement and for development, one sees that the point made by my hon. Friend about being precise is taken. Streets are marked off in action area Plan 3 and again in the action area plan for redevelopment, in Figure 4a, so there comes a time when maps and plots of land are precisely identified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But we are not dealing with local plans. We are dealing with Clause 2, which concerns structure plans.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And action areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is true, but essentially a structure plan is a written statement. It may be accompanied by all kinds of aids to explain it, but basically it is a written statement of policy. I think that the essential message of the P.A.G. Report is that one must take a large area and decide on its economic and social future in broad terms, not necessarily bringing oneself down to precise areas, because they may be changed. Once a survey has been proposed it is open to debate. I know that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) is anxious to get to Clause 3 so that we can consider his Amendments about how the public are brought into this, but in general terms there is a written statement. It cannot be precise about
	<span class='label label-info column'>62</span>
everything, because when one proceeds to make a structure plan, that plan accepts general principles for the area, and then the Secretary of State looks to the local authority to take that structure plan and make within it local plans of different kinds in order to apply the general principles of the written statement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Am I right in thinking that it is at the struoture plan stage that an objection will be lodged? To safeguard his interests an applicant will object at the structure plan stage, whether he has an objection or not. He will do so purely to safeguard his interests against the time when the local plan is produced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that my hon. Friend is arguing that, whenever a written statement is produced, and it seems that a road will be driven near someone's house, or, alternatively, that there will be some industrial zoning near someone's house, although it is not possible to be precise about whether such a proposal will in fact affect the person concerned, there will be lots of objections. That is why I emphasise that the phasing leading up to the structure plan is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A structure plan is not an Ordnance map assessment. It cannot be. If one looks at the kind of planning that we have had in Scotland in the form of structure plans, one sees that that is so. One may plan roads, but there may have to be deviations, sometimes for geological reasons, sometimes for reasons of good management, and sometimes because of objections by persons who would be affected. The structure plan will merely determine that a road should be in approximately a certain position. I accept that it is difficult to persuade the public of the good sense of having the roads where they are planned, but if one is to have large scale planning one must realise that it cannot be done on the basis of a theory advanced by a plot holder, and therefore the structure plans and the subsequent implementation of the local plans are extremely important. The rights of individuals are also important, but as far as I am aware everyone is agreed on the fundamentals of the P.A.G. Report. There is no party battle on this. Not even the Liberals object on the grounds that it is an invasion of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0854">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>63</span>
privacy, or anything else. It is accepted that it is good sound policy to have planning at these two distinct levels.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No Member of the Liberal Party is here today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is so, but I have never heard any opinion contrary to that which I have just stated, and I am, therefore, entitled to make that statement, whether the Liberals are here or not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 2 is a fundamental Clause and it is important to accept that the structure plan is not a map. It is not a diagram. It can be aided by maps and diagrams, but it is essentially a written statement. If hon. Members look at the subsections of the Clause they will see that they conform to the new ideas of planning, particularly to economic and social assessments. That is what the P.A.G. was set up to do. It was set up to bring the Statutes of 1947 relating to England, Wales and Scotland up to date, and it is, therefore, right that the Government should be anxious to do just that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is only in relation to action areas that Clause 2 refers to a plan as being something in the nature of a plan as we understand it. Subsection (3) talks about the structure plan being a written statement. Subsection (5) talks about action areas which must be indicated
	<br><blockquote><p>"which they have selected for the commencement during a prescribed period of comprehensive treatment, in accordance with a local plan …".</p></blockquote>
Then we are told under a reference to Figure 3 that this is the kind of thing we are to get. That is fair enough, but when the structure plan is produced with the rough layout indicated, and the action areas denoted thereon, will the action areas be accompanied by a local definitive plan? If they are not at that stage accompanied by a local definitive plan, but this is something that will follow later, a lot of opposition will be generated simply because people will not know enough about the proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that it is unlikely that the structure plan and the local plan will ever run parallel. They will be years ahead, or years behind, each other. I know that it is a difficult balance, but a vague structure plan may increase
	<span class='label label-info column'>64</span>
planning blight. Because of the natural inference that a road may be constructed in a certain area, people will not develop their land in case it is taken over. I wonder if the Minister could direct a little of his thinking to whether this will decrease or increase planning blight through the necessarily blurred edges of the structure plan.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would hope not. I take the point of the hon. and learned Gentleman about subsection (5). He is quite right in what he says regarding the sequence of events. On the question of structure plans, and other plans which must be approved by the Secretary of State directly, I am told that Section 8 of the Countryside Act, 1967, gives the general power in relation to areas of special planning control which are referred to in other Statutes as well. There is also Section 9. Of course, we certainly would want to ask the Commission to advise us on structure plans, and we would have the powers so to do under Section 8. I take his point. There is practically no place I can think of which would have a substantial structure plan which would not involve some part of the countryside. Therefore, the Countryside Commission would have to be prepared to advise us as Statute requires. We as a Government would certainly want the Commission to advise us on this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I point out that these are the prodromal stages? If we look at Clause 3 we see how we rise from an arena of public consultation and concern to debate the nature of the written statement. It may be a debate of a general nature or a debate concerned solely with the self-interest of the person concerned who wishes to find out what the application may mean to him. After that consultation has taken place, we proceed to the formal stage of publishing a structure plan. That is the stage for formal objection. Once that is approved by the Secretary of State, in whatever modified form he may suggest, we then go to the stage when we apply it within the structure plan. That is when the Secretary of State can insist that this may follow the local plans, picking out the words which they have selected for the commencement during a prescribed period of comprehensive treatment. As the plans
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0855">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>65</span>
here show, there can be areas of treatment either of redevelopment, as in Figure 4a, or of improvement, as in Figure 3.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore I would suggest to the Committee that Clause 2 is substantial and absolutely fundamental. I hope it is a Clause which we can agree to accept in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree it is a very substantial Clause, and that is why I wish to raise two or three points before we leave it. First of all, the Minister, earlier this morning, gave a slight indication of size because he spoke of a structure plan covering the whole of the Clyde Estuary, if I understood him correctly. I wonder if he could tell us more about this, whether there is, as a result of the provisions in the Bill any limit on the size of a structure plan if those concerned with planning were to come together to cover a whole area. One notes in subsection (3)(	<i>b</i>) of the Clause that general proposals in neighbouring districts are also to be taken into account in the structure plans. Would those general proposals be part of a structure plan in another district, or are they general proposals in previous plans which they would be taking into account. The Committee, I am sure, would like to know more about the concept of a structure plan in relation to the possibility of the size of the area to be covered both in population and geography.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then there is another important point. I referred to this at Second Reading. Under subsection (3)(	<i>a</i>) the management of traffic is to be taken into account. In principle, we on this side of the Committee welcome the addition of traffic management in planning, following everything that Professor Buchanan and others have brought to the country's attention on this important field. I wonder if the Minister could say a little more about what the Government have in mind here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman opposite raised the question of Glasgow. There is no doubt that there is concern here because of the special Scottish provision for outline comprehensive development areas, which is helpful to Glasgow. If I understood what the Minister said this morning, he said that his noble Friend
	<span class='label label-info column'>66</span>
had had a recent discussion with representatives of the Corporation. That is welcome news. What he said was that he was unable to give an assurance now, but I hope he will agree that what he said this morning was that a promise of consultation had been given to Glasgow Corporation—not an assurance, but a promise of consultation—on the question of dates. I hope this means that Glasgow will be fully consulted, even if an assurance cannot be given now, that under Clause 102 this Part of the Bill would not be brought into effect once it has become an Act in such a way as to interfere with areas where the C.D.A. procedure had applied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. In talking about Glasgow, I think we are getting very wide of the Question, That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. G. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I raised this because it was brought up by the hon. Gentleman opposite, and the Minister made what was an important statement in reply. Whether it is better for this to be dealt with in another part of the Bill is for you to say, Mr. Brewis. However, as the Minister made this statement this morning, I would only ask that he confirms that his answer intended what I have stated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are the points with which I hope the Minister will deal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to raise one specific point which I would be grateful if the Minister would answer. My hon. and learned Friend, and my hon. Friend the Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Gordon Campbell) raised the general question of consultation and how important it is at the fundamental stage of preparation of structure plans. We have mentioned the Countryside Commission, which will have a statutory obligation to consult. I would like to raise a slightly more specific point in relation to the National Playing Fields Association. I know it has been in touch with the Minister of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here is a body which has no statutory obligation to consult. It is a body vitally concerned about the provision of recreational space, especially in urban areas. I do not wish to develop this point at any length because the hon. Gentleman knows the issues raised by it. However, there is great concern in the National Playing
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0856">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>67</span>
Fields Association that the Bill does not lay any statutory obligation for the provision of space in the preparation of structure plans. Therefore, it would be helpful if he could give an assurance that, while nothing specific can be written into this Bill, at least local authorities will be expected, in the preparation of this structure plan, as well as considering such things as traffic, to make certain that adequate recreational space is provided in these areas, and that that space is provided not only adequately but also with reasonable access for the people living in the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is something which has caused problems in the past. I could develop this point, but I do not intend to do so as I think the Minister knows the argument. It would be very much appreciated by those interested in this type of development if he could give an assurance on this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could I be clear on two things? Do I understand that it will be Government practice to consult the Countryside Commission on the presentation of a structure plan? I understood the Minister to say that, but would he just confirm it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the local plan referred to in subsection (5), will the local plan in the action area context be produced at the same time as the structure plan, and, presumably, have the Ordnance survey base which is shown in Figure 3 of the P.A.G. Report? May I emphasise that if the only indication of an action area is a circle on a map an enormous amount of trouble will be generated. It will have a lot of trouble if on these written statements which constitute the structure plan, where they refer to action areas, there is an Ordnance Survey-based detailed plan for the action area. Can I just be quite clear that that is how it will operate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I first take the point of the hon. Gentleman the Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Gordon Campbell) on limitation? No: there will be no limitation on the extent of a structure plan. It depends on the nature of the authorities concerned. If the authorities within the Clyde Valley Planning Advisory Committee decided that they wished to join together for the purposes of Part I, then that would be an enorm-
	<span class='label label-info column'>68</span>
ous area. It would virtually be half of Scotland in terms of people, and a very substantial area of land as well. If anyone drawing up a structure plan for that area attempted to do the kind of thing that the hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) was asking for in the second part of his last submission, it would clearly be impossible. No one could ever publish such a plan. Even Sir Patrick Abercrombie could not do this. No one could publish a regional plan for an area of this size and be able to identify to the exact point of a plot of land in that whole area what precisely he was proposing. In other words, one cannot have local plans of such a large area published co-incidentally with a structure plan foi the whole area. It would be both physically and in planning terms impossible, and, indeed, undesirable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nobody suggested that. That would be nonsense. One cannot produce a structure plan in this kind of detail. All I am asking for here is to be clear on the position where an action area in a structure plan is referred to. This is indicated by a circle on the map at the moment. Where an action area is indicated, are we going to have a detailed plan for the action area? That is a different thing from saying a detailed plan for the whole area. That would be nonsense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a matter for the local authority to determine when it can do this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was going to go on to promote my second argument, which is, that a structure plan may be applied by a comparatively small authority. In that case the authority may be able, at the same time as it is formally proposing a structure plan, in order to avoid difficulties locally, to do the kind of thing my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgeton (Mr. James Bennett) mentioned, which is, to publish the local plan at the same time. When one does outline C.D.A.s, and one has comprehensive improvement areas under various housing powers, there is always concern about a street being left out or a street being put in; there is always some concern about the way these things are handled. What I am saying to the Committee is that the general idea of a structure plan is really to have an area
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0857">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>69</span>
larger than the area of the present planning authorities. The hon. and learned Gentleman now seconds me in the acceptance of the fact that, that being so, one cannot coincidentally publish local plans and detailed action areas at the same time as arguing the generality of a structure plan written statement. It is true that there may be such circumstances, but I would not like to acknowledge that they will exist, because I am not quite certain that that would be the way it would turn out. I would like the Committee to think of a structure plan in the general sense of its being over a very large area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In another part of his question the hon. and learned Gentleman asked me about the Countryside Commission. Let us get it right. Under Section 8, the Countryside Commission is obliged to advise the Secretary of State or the local planning authority. I would like to see the Countryside Commission at the beginning of the survey of the plan, before it becomes formalised, being brought into consultations quite deliberately by the local planning authority so that, when the Secretary of State, in his turn, seeks to get advice from the Countryside Commission, it is more or less agreed advice, or as agreed as is possible between two agencies of such a substantial kind as a local planning authority and the Countryside Commission. I accept that, if there is disagreement, then that disagreement will come to the Secretary of State after the formal stage. That is the provision of Section 8. It is emphasised by Section 9 where, in terms of the areas of special planning control, the Countryside Commission will be concerned with any structure plan which would in any way prejudice the Commission's position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On peripheral interests, I agree that this emphasises the point. When dealing with peripheral interests of an outside area it is very important to speak in general terms. I acknowledge that the previous work done in all development plans will be of enormous use; and none of it will be lost in the preparation of the structure plan. I accept the point on traffic since that is a new subject to planning. Not only in the Report of Professor Buchanan but also in the arguments put forward by many others prior
	<span class='label label-info column'>70</span>
to that, it was stated that account should be taken of that factor; and account has been taken, though not perhaps to the extent that we should like.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The classic argument in Scotland in terms of planning where traffic management was the complete key to the proposals of the authorities, and to the attitude of the Secretary of State, was in Edinburgh, where we had the argument about the inner ring road and what it would cost in terms of the loss of property of architectural value in Edinburgh. It is important that Edinburgh Corporation should ensure that there is a proper transport study with a parallel assessment of property of architectural worth affected by the placing of the proposed roads, and that these factors should be considered side by side.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of consultation with the authorities on the application of Part I is very important, as I acknowledge; but no one in this Committee would suggest that consultation means that the authority has a power of veto. It is the Government who, at some time, must make a final decision as to the date of application of Part I. We would like, of course, to do that with the assent and full co-operation of the authority and there will be full consultation in trying to reach an amicable agreement; but if that is not possible then we will make the decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased to acknowledge the point made by the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) about the National Playing Fields Association. I have recently written him a letter explaining the position. We have carefully considered the Association's suggestion with regard to recreational space. In the Bill a very specific obligation is placed on planning authorities to consider development plans in general terms and to take into consideration not just traffic, communications, economic and similar factors, but all other points, including that rightly made by the Association. I have acknowledged certain provisions in Clauses 2 and 6 to which we shall come later. I certainly acknowledge that local planning authorities should give full consideration to the provision of playing fields, but I feel it would be a mistake to attempt to put this in specific terms in the Bill, since those terms would not necessarily be applicable in every place
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0858">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>71</span>
at every time; so that it would be difficult to lay down such a provision in a statute. Perhaps we can argue that later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for speaking again, but in the Second Reading debate on the Bill the Minister himself made it quite clear that, in his view, action areas were to be fairly specifically spelled out. He said that
	<br><blockquote><p>"action areas are much more specific than those comprehensive development areas, which are pretty good."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Scottish Grand Committee,</i> 23rd January, 1969; c. 103.]</p></blockquote>
I am concerned at what seems to be the position because it is extremely difficult to pin the Minister of State down on anything, and one has to keep at him to try to find out the position. I understand that the present position is that a structure plan which includes a reference to an action area will not necessarily be accompanied, at that stage, by the local plan for the action area. If, when these structure plans come forward, they make reference to action areas, which may be denoted by a circle or a number on the map, there will be trouble; and if they cannot be accompanied at the structure plan stage by a written, detailed plan then it would be better to leave them out and to introduce another procedure, because uncertainty of this kind will give rise to trouble.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note what the Minister says with regard to the Countryside Commission, but at present there is no statutory obligation on the Commission to give advice unless it is asked to do so. Clause 8 (1) of the Countryside (Scotland) Act, 1967, provides that the Commission may advise the Secretary of State or the local planning authority and also provides:
	<br><blockquote><p>"and if so requested by the Secretary of State or any local planning authority shall advise …"</p></blockquote>
That is the position, so that the Countryside Commission may give advice. But how is the Commission to learn about structure plan development? There is no obligation in Clause 2 for intimation of a plan to be given to the Commission, so how does the Commission get to know? The Minister now hopes that the local planning authorities will discuss things with the Commission, but at one stage I understood it was intended that as a matter of practice—although the Minister has rather veered off this—when the Secretary of State gets a structure plan
	<span class='label label-info column'>72</span>
in his hands he will consult the Countryside Commission. If that is to be the position I am happy to leave it there, but is that what is going to happen? Is the Secretary of State going to consult the Countryside Commission, or is he going to seek its advice when he receives a structure plan? It seems to me that that would be a suitable solution to the problem, but in the absence of some such undertaking for some kind of administrative solution, which would be preferable, it seems to me it would be better to try to link the structure plan activities of the local planning authority with the Countryside Commission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Minister replies on the Countryside Commission can he tell us how it is to intervene in the structure plan? In a recent Parliamentary reply by the Secretary of State it was said that the Commission has no money to do anything at all. So how is it to get involved in detailed planning and procedures which might, at the end of the day, give rise to public inquiries? We want to know what staff the Commission has for this detailed planning work and how it is to be carried out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Lawson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been concerned with the question raised by the hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) with regard to action areas. As I understand it, we have in the structure plan a general description of what is intended, but I take it that that is to be applied over a considerable period of years. I take it, also, that it would be the intention to start work in different parts of an area at different times. Within the general plan there will be certain clearly marked ideas on what might be done about given areas, without the details being worked out; and there will be certain areas where we shall propose to start work soon along certain lines. I am concerned about the situation which, with the approval of the general plan, could arise in specific areas which are mentioned, described as action areas, if, when the general plan was approved any decision was taken that could jeopardise the possibility of people residing within action areas being able to ensure that their subsequent criticisms, complaints or objections would be adequately dealt with. With the making of an overall decision, they should not be put in a less favourable position to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0859">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>73</span>
argue their case when the details come out subsequently. They should still have facilities for making objections when the detailed plan comes forward for handling the action areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot see where the difficulties mentioned by the hon. and learned Gentleman arise. Within the general plan there are certain areas in which we propose to take action of a certain kind. For example, we may say that in a particular area we do not want any industrial building and that it should be residential; or we may want a particular area to be an industrial area. On this kind of basis I would have thought that reasonable, and to be expected in terms of continuous action, when it is not a case of just putting forward general plans which might come into existence ten, years hence. In a plan for continuous action, some of it beginning fairly soon, one would expect different degrees of urgency and precision to show themselves. The general plan can have a certain measure of precision in this sense, and that is what I understand by action areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If my understanding is correct, and people affected by the action areas will have an opportunity to have their objections aired and considered, then I cannot see any reason for treating this other than in the way proposed. Within the general structure of the plan there is also a certain measure of precision for areas in which we hope to work quickly along certain lines. This is reasonable and I would be disappointed if it were not so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the difficulty that when the public see an area on the map, vaguely outlined perhaps in red, as being subject to comprehensive treatment of some kind, albeit they will have a later opportunity, when the detailed proposals in the plan come forward, to make their objections, none the less they will be tempted to protest at an early stage?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lawson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take it also that they will be given assurances that the final details have not been worked out and that they will have as much opportunity as they would formerly have had to get their objections considered. I would take that to be a reasonable line and I feel that, by and large, reasonable people would accept it as a reasonable line.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following the reply of my hon. Friend to the point made by the hon. Gentleman the Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro), which I thought was an important one, certainly, in cities, what difference would this make to planning blight, which causes a great deal of difficulty to ordinary folk, because they cannot sell their houses, or can get for them only half what they would? In my constituency we have had examples of this, particularly in the Portobello area, where quite a number of ordinary people suffered great hardship as a result of this. I did not understand from the reply of my hon. Friend to what extent the new procedure will affect the position in this respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take up my right hon. Friend's point by saying we can debate this matter when we consider Clause 33. I will go into the matter of planning blight then, but I should have thought that the existence of a structure plan, although not definitive in the Ordnance Survey sense, does give the action areas definite objectives without each area being changed at the same time. Clause 2 states that this is the intention, and I would suggest that the matter of planning blight—which I readily agree is a bad thing—will be reduced rather than in creased as a result of the application of this new system. This is a matter worthy of further study and, as I have said, I will deal with it very thoroughly when we reach a later part of the Bill. That is all I can say at the moment, but since I was asked the question, I thought it only right that I should reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that my hon. Friend the Member for Motherwell (Mr. Lawson) made an admirable contribution and I am indebted to him for explaining the position, and I think he did it better than I did.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) that the Countryside Commission is in its early days. I can tell the Committee that we are certainly often alarmed when hon. Members ask about it in the House and about how much money is being given to such and such a plan, because we fear that they may be demanding a cut. Hon. Members opposite often press for cuts in expenditure, and there are flutterings in the

	<span class='label label-info column'>75</span>
dovecots when Questions are put down about it. The Commission will get £85,000 in the financial year 1969-70, which is not bad when we remember that the Commission was established only last year, and there will be £65,000 available for countryside grants to local authorities by the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are also continually pressed to reduce the number of civil servants. The Commission has a small staff of about twelve and working very well.

The Countryside Commission is a natural place for planning work. The hon. and learned Member for Pentlands seemed to think that the provisions of the Countryside Act would not be adequate. Of course, he may have suspicious feelings because of some inquiry of which I have no knowledge, but if he will turn to Clause 13(1,	<i>e</i>) he will see that the Secretary of State has power to make regulations to
	<br><blockquote><p>"require or authorise a local planning authority to consult with or consider the views of other persons before taking any prescribed procedural step".</p></blockquote>
So, even if his suspicions are proven in practice, then we have power to see that the Countryside Commission is not ignored. The Secretary of State has power to ask it to look at a structure plan. I think that I have dealt with the points which have been raised—oh no, I have not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lawson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has mentioned the Countryside Commission and its rights in the matter of consultation, but there is an older body whose interest might be seen as being much more long-term, and which might be kept in mind when we think of the changes which might be wrought in our countryside. I am thinking of the Nature Conservancy. And I am thinking of a place near Hamilton where a great motorway was driven through or adjacent to a bird sanctuary of long, long standing. I take it that the sanctuary cannot continue. While I do not say there should not have been a motorway, I also think we might go ahead with planning with a view to providing very nice parks, places of recreation——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is concerned with the publicity attendant upon planning decisions and proposals. I think it right to say that there is no field in which more heat is generated than in the field of planning. Anything which can be done to improve the public relations aspect of planning ought to be done. The general statements of intention and the general expressions of view contained in this Clause will command the support of the whole Committee, and my only criticism is that although they are not the kind of sentiments from which one could dissent, they are very general in their terms and I wonder how effective these proposals are likely to be and whether there will be, in practice, any major change in existing procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would read quickly subsection (1):
	<br><blockquote><p>"When preparing a structure plan … and before finally determining its content for submission to the Secretary of State, the local planning authority shall take such steps as will in their opinion secure that adequate publicity is given …"</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>78</span>
and so forth. Now, adequate publicity in the past has always been intimation in a newspaper, but that, in my respectful submission, is not adequate. I can think of many examples of planning inquiries and other inquiries which have escaped the notice of interested parties and often those who were professionally interested. I think it is common knowledge that it is very easy for one to miss a newspaper intimation; for example, an intimation of a planning inquiry involving land in the west of Scotland might legitimately be publicised in 	<i>The Scotsman,</i> which is hardly read in the west and——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—the same notice might not be in 	<i>The Glasgow Herald,</i> which is widely read there. I give this purely as an example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a great deal of sympathy for the proposal in Amendment No. 102 and I would like to see every householder told of proposals likely to affect him. The question is whether that kind of Amendment fits so easily into Clause 3 as it would into Clause 7. We are dealing here with a structure plan, and it may be more difficult to operate the personal intimation over such a wide field. I would like to develop this argument when we discuss Clause 7 if I have the chance, but I say for the moment that it might be possible for a planning authority to do this. After all, rating authorities find no great difficulty in intimating their bits of information to every householder. Not one is left out, and I think it would be simply a case of taking the rating intimation machinery and envelope addressing system for this purpose and enclosing the necessary notice. Or information could be given simply that details could be obtained upon request.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that Clause 3 will have to be tightened up, because, if it is left as it stands, it will simply be for the local authority to satisfy itself that there has been what is considered to be adequate publicity, and this will have been by way of the usual practice of inserting a newspaper advertisement. I do not think that that is enough. We say that the local authority shall take such steps as are necessary "in additional to newspaper intimation" in order to obtain adequate publicity, and it is with this consideration in mind that this Amendment is put forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12 noon.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clark Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Every hon. Member has come across cases of planning where the publicity surrounding it has been quite inadequate. Time and again in my constituency, and in Edinburgh generally, development permission has been granted and the thing takes place before people in the neighbourhood are aware of what is afoot. By then it is too late to protest. In some cases the persons concerned are to blame, but it is not so every time. Previous planning Acts have had gaps and faults in them on this question of publicity, and I have raised it in the House many times, not only with the hon. Gentleman, but when there was a Unionist Government. I have never been successful in getting an alteration. I am only thankful that there are such things as the Cockburn Association and the Liberton Association, and other bodies which keep a watchful eye on developments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree very much with my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie), but the purpose of my Amendment is to ensure that every householder in an area knows what is proposed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Dempsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman really mean that in an area of, say, 12,000 households, each should be circulated?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, indeed that is my suggestion, that everyone should be informed. They can be informed of what their rates are: they can be informed of what is about to happen in their neighbourhood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not see any great expense involved. Either this intimation could be sent round with the rates, or a postcard could be sent, warning people, and saying that further details were available. Thus, no one would be taken by surprise and a great deal more justice would be done. In all this we must remember that the individual is at a serious disadvantage and is fighting a machine equipped with resources and money. I am out to protect the individual.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. and learned Friend said that a lot of this might be applicable to Clause 7, and I agree, but I want to raise the matter now to see what the Government's intentions are, and whether they will pay attention to the rights of the individual.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>80</span>
I have little to say about the further Amendment, to do with the word "adequately". It is unnecessary, rather vague, and could be contentious. To say that planning arrangements have been achieved is quite sufficient.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to support my hon. Friends, because it is important that we try to get it across to the public that they are being asked to participate in planning, not the reverse, which is often what they feel. It is very much more important in the cities, which do not have the local newspapers as we know them in the countryside and which make it much easier to disseminate information. Most planning authorities do not look for opposition and tend to press on without giving people in their area the information which they ought to have. We have to encourage planning authorities to meet this opposition and carry it with them. If the discussions are early, then, often, expensive and long drawn-out formal applications later are avoided. There has been a good deal of criticism from the general public about planning procedure—that it is unfair, that its operation is obscure, bureaucratic, that it is too slow, that it is harmful to individuals, and that it increases planning blight. There is the severe criticism from time to time of the statutory undertaker.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All these matters must be seen to be under consideration. We have to try to increase the amount of co-operation between the planning authorities and the areas with which they are dealing. Planning must be given the maximum of planning and publicity in advance of any final decisions. The procedure in the Clyde Plan is welcome. The Plan is worked out and presented to the public well ahead of a final decision, and all Scotland is now having a good chew on the Clyde Plan, and talking about the pros and cons. At the end of the day, when a final decision is required it will be all the easier to take.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This approach should be encouraged and local authorities should, in more ways than by an intimation in the newspapers, tell the public what is going on. It is not difficult to do this. The regional television authorities would be only too pleased to have discussions on this type of thing. In particularly important cases the planning authority should run a series
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0863">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>81</span>
of public meetings. The more publicity the better. As my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) has said, with more detailed plans affecting urban areas, there have to be other means to bring these to the notice of householders. One statement in the Press that a plan is being developed is not sufficient. This Amendment gives the opporunity for much more extensive coverage, and should be supported.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Gentlemen opposite have raised an important point, although I am not happy about the Amendments. In Edinburgh we had a notable example with the inner ring road. No one ever knew what was going on until the plan had been prepared. It then cost thousands of pounds for ordinary citizens to object. I do not know the figure but I believe it ran to tens of thousands of pounds. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) will remember this. It is an intolerable situation for citizens of a large city like Edinburgh. The proposals contained in the scheme were quite fantastic, particularly in so far as they dealt with the New Town of Edinburgh. One wondered what sort of people were making these plans.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Barbarians.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am inclined to agree with the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When planners are given their heads we get some astonishing results. I could quote cases in Edinburgh today which are quite deplorable. No one knew anything about this plan until it had been drawn up and prepared, and then it cost an enormous amount of money to fight it. The money had to be raised by voluntary subscriptions, and it is unfair to the individual citizen, anxious to preserve the amenities of his city.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Something ought to be done whereby local authorities or planning authorities have to bring citizens into consultation fairly early. I do not know whether this subsection achieves that. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"When preparing a structure plan for their district …"</p></blockquote>
Certainly in the early stages of preparation the citizens, or the people within a given area, ought to be brought into consultation. They ought to know what is
	<span class='label label-info column'>82</span>
going on within the recesses of the local authority. The feelings of citizens ought to be tested and I do not know whether the Amendments will achieve this. The Amendment of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South is an exceedingly difficult one, considered in the context of a large area—say, the whole of the Clyde Valley. There are something like 1,500,000 people, probably 500,000 homes. His suggestion would be more appropriate to an action plan rather than a structure plan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Usually the Press does not know about a plan until it is finalised, when they publish it. People object, but by that time it is rather late in the day. Perhaps there could be some obligation placed upon local authorities to take steps to publicise matters before they draw up the plan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an important matter, and I hope that my hon. Friend can give us some help, because I am puzzled by this subsection. I do not know whether it will achieve what I would like it to achieve. If not, I would like to see some changes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. A. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I confess myself to be in favour of planning and agree with Patrick Geddes, who said that the purpose of local and national Government was to plan the city beautiful, and to make the conditions in which we live conditions of which we could be proud. There is no doubt that planners can get certain bees in their bonnets. In Edinburgh they proposed to have motor cars rushing about at 70 miles an hour, and were nearly ready to build a road over the top of Princes Street, and even to knock down part of the New Town, to get the motor cars in quicker. There were other ways of doing it, and I was glad that that project was halted until there could be second thoughts about it. Edinburgh has opportunities of having by-passes because nature has given it underground routes, as through the Grassmarket, and already there are bridges which no planner could excel. There might be some justification for making thoroughfares under existing roads rather than over them. Tunnels which were built for the railways could be used to provide roadways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also believe in preserving history in stone, and the idea that a plan like the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0864">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>83</span>
New Town of Edinburgh should be mutilated or destroyed merely to allow motor cars to go a little faster seems horrifying. As a member of the Historic Buildings Council I know that everything is being done—and in this we have, I hope, the support of interests in the City of Edinburgh as well as of its citizens—to try to preserve these buildings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Just how far the public can be brought into this is a difficult matter. When plans are produced, what happens next very often depends on organisations which are interested in such matters. This can, of course, work the other way. There is a piece of dirty earth in the middle of Queensferry Street where trees were planted simply because the builders could not be bothered to get rid of the earth. They built a wall round it and planted trees in the middle. It is not a garden by any stretch of the imagination, but, because the Cockburn Association caused such a stir, the Corporation was compelled to allow traffic congestion to occur and to leave in place this mound of earth which nobody wanted to move. It hinders traffic moving east and west.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulty lies in deciding how to bring the public into taking an interest in these matters at an early stage. People are usually disinterested till something hits them in the face. In the long run it must be for the Secretary of State and the Scottish Office to ensure that plans affecting the public are properly considered, and that there is the sort of thing that Tom Johnston set up when the Hydroelectricity Board was being set up: there must be an amenities committee or some such organisation to supervise what is being done. On that committee there should be planners, technical people, and people interested in amenities and in history, to ensure that history does not prevent progress, and that progress does not destroy history.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Americans come to this country they do so not to see blocks of cement flats twenty storeys high, or a number of cement boxes. They come here to see a European civilisation, and Edinburgh, along with many of our towns in Scotland, has some wonderful examples of that. Somebody said that the beautiful buildings of Glasgow are so close together that they cannot be seen properly. If we destroy all that is beautiful in our
	<span class='label label-info column'>84</span>
towns, we shall bring about in the world a uniformity which will destroy the great value of much of what we regard as our civilisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that some method will be found by which the Secretary of State has the power to say, "Bide a wee till we have another look at this", and then people who have differing points of view are allowed to consider the matter and come to some judgment about it. That is the best that we can do, because obviously there must be a compromise between progress and preservation. I am a planner, but I am also a preserver of what is beautiful. Some of the work done by our ancestors will never be repeated. In an utilitarian world buildings will be put up which are an eyesore, and it would be a tragedy to destroy the beauty of what we have now. The New Town of Edinburgh is almost unique, but it is at risk of being destroyed by deterioration. People are trying to preserve the beauty of that great city. All these things must be fitted into a pattern, and I do not see anybody but the Secretary of State and his organisation being able to do that. The Secretary of State ought to have at his disposal some means of bringing proposals before the public at an early stage so that things which ought to be preserved are not destroyed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept what was said by my right hon. Friend the Member for East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn) and perhaps the film by Jacques Tati called "Playtime" is an example of the argument that my right hon. Friend is trying to put.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should not like to be drawn by my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) in to an argument about the past, or to express any opinion about the Planning Committee of Edinburgh, or to use the expletive adopted by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would not my hon. Friend agree that that is a notorious example of how an endeavour to change what was clearly worthwhile preserving cost the citizens thousands of pounds?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to continue my argument. There is another side to the story. Under the present system the Planning Committee of Edinburgh, like
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0865">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>85</span>
all planning committees, is required to give the public access to plans only after a considerable amount of time and effort has been spent on preparing them. What the P.A.G. Report and the Bill say is that we ought to change that procedure because it is a bit late in the day, having produced a draft plan, to take into account any objections that are made and then rewrite the plan. What happened in Edinburgh was that there was not a useful dialogue or an interchange of views between citizen and council official. Some councillors defended with might and main the whole position against any objections which anyone raised. My right hon. Friend the Member for East Stirlingshire demonstrated that sometimes objections are absurd, and he gave examples. There are people who would change nothing, and there are others who would change everything. Clearly, there is a happy medium. Things cannot remain immutable. It is wrong to change things for the sake of change, and that is well demonstrated in Edinburgh, which is perhaps the architectural jewel in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is stirring things now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not at all. I have said many times that Glasgow has beautiful buildings, but there is no city in northern Europe that can boast of having as many beautiful buildings as Edinburgh has. These are to be found in the medieval town and in the New Town of the Georgian era. There are also some beautiful late Victorian and early twentieth century buildings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 3 must be read with Clause 13. What we are trying to do is to ensure that the Secretary of State will be the judge of what is adequate publicity under subsection (4). There is in being the Skeffington Committee—a Great Britain Committee, because these problems affect England, Wales and Scotland—and I hope that the Committee will give us guidance about how officers of the State can judge when a local authority has adequately publicised any plans which it produces. In other words, there is a definite attempt to get a real dialogue between citizen and council official over what should be done. I have no doubt that when we get the Skeffington Report
	<span class='label label-info column'>86</span>
we shall find it a very good document I hope that it will contain recommendations about the kind of regulations which should be made to ensure that there is proper public participation, and that we shall try to give guidance to local authorities by means of both circulars and regulations. We shall not content ourselves with exhortations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our desire with regard to Part 1 of the Bill—and I said this at the conference in Edinburgh in January, 1967—is to change the whole view of the dialogue. We want it to be carried out much earlier than it is now. We want people to be brought into the picture much earlier in the day so that we can, at the beginning, argue the planning authority's survey and look again at the structure plan. We want to be able to consider the survey which proceeds the local plan in Clause 7. We want to be able to discuss any changes which may be proposed in the plan under Clause 5, and later under Clause 10. We want to ensure that at all these stages there is full publicity and a full opportunity for people to make representations, backed by discussions, exhibitions, public meetings, and so on. It is only with that kind of background that the next development plan provisions can be understood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On behalf of earnest planning conveners and officials who have done their best to help by arranging exhibitions, and so on, it must be said that the public do not always turn out in force to see what is proposed, and that is wrong. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, South admitted that sometimes, through their own fault, not the fault of any local authority or of the Government, people will not go along to see what is proposed. They come in at about one minute to twelve to ask for the whole scheme to be reversed because, they say, they knew nothing about it. If we try to give adequate publicity, the public must accept that they have a rôle to play, and they must not complain if, by failing to play that rôle, they are unaware of what is being done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his proposal, which is not favoured by his colleagues, that hon. Member for Edinburgh, South is arguing that we should send notice of a plan to every householder. It depends on what he means. If he means a structure plan
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0866">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>87</span>
involving, say, the Clyde Valley, about 1½ million or perhaps even 2 million people would be involved. If he means simply a reprint of the written statement, that might not be expensive. It might come to a few shillings a head. If we were to send each householder the whole structure plan, that is the written statement and all the aids, that could cost up to 10s. In fact, the plans for the Falkirk-Grangemouth area, or the Greater Livingston area, or the old Edinburgh Development Planning Review of 1955, could cost three guineas, or four guineas, or ten guineas. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, South cannot be arguing that each householder should receive with his rates notice a book costing 10s., two guineas or ten guineas. A book costing 10s. would mean a 1d. rate, even for the 160,000 households in Edinburgh.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman is suggesting that notice of the existence of a structure plan, or notice of the existence of a local plan, should be sent to every householder, that is not a bad suggestion, and I am willing to accept it as a suggestion to be considered when the Skeffington Report is published and when we are about to make regulations and give guidance, but I am not prepared to incorporate it in the Bill, because that would lead to a great deal of misunderstanding, as it could be argued that the provision had not been observed because a ten guinea book had not been sent to every householder. All right, I accept the protest now. That is what is meant. I would, then, ask the hon. Gentleman not to press this Amendment, but to accept the assurance I have given him on this suggestion. Maybe hon. Members may want to make other suggestions later, when the Skeffington Report is published,
	<span class='label label-info column'>88</span>
so that the Secretary of State can ensure that the publicity given is adequate.

Turning to the Amendment about newspaper information, I accept that the writing of the hon. and learned Gentleman and that of the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Gordon Campbell) is deplorable. The two doctors in this Committee who are excellent writers, if I may say so, will certainly give tuition on better writing to these two gentlemen. I say that proudly on behalf of a profession which is maligned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. M. S. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Free?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I meant to say to the Committee is that the hon. and learned Member for Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) knows that the Amendment, if we were to accept it and if it were effective, could be turned on itself. It is not adequate simply to state the phrase in the Amendment, because we could escape that by the illustration he gave of advertising in a paper which did not circulate extensively in the area concerned—not that I accept that 	<i>The Scotsman</i> is not read in Glasgow. It could be said that we should advertise in the newspaper with the largest circulation in Scotland. I would not like to accept that either. I accept that newspaper advertising is a reasonable thing to be done, but it ought not to go in the Bill. It ought to go in the regulations. We ought to look at any further arguments promoted to us in the light of the argument about the regulations rather than the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I now turn to the hon. Gentleman's point about the word "adequately", which is the third Amendment? This perhaps has a legal flavour to it. If one extracted the word "adequately" and left it as "satisfied" then it might be argued that the element of discretion or judgment implied by the word "adequately" is thus already present in the word "satisfied". It could be said that once the Secretary of State is satisfied the presumption is that he is adequately satisfied. What if something were omitted unintentionally in the process, within the regulations or within the guidance? Someone might then argue that the Secretary of State could not have been adequately satisfied because he failed to know this or to know that. We could not unwind the whole position, the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0867">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>89</span>
Secretary of State having satisfied himself in terms of Statute, by a plea that he had not adequately satisfied himself. We feel it right that the Secretary of State should decide that the information before him is adequate for him to make a decision, and that that decision is to his satisfaction. Whilst I admit that it is a marginal legal point, I am strongly advised that we should leave the word "adequately" in for the sake of making the statute a strong one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee feel content that we have emphasised the overall point that we want to change the present system of public participation so that the public genuinely under Clause 3 get a proper dialogue with the authorities, and the authorities in their turn are able to promote plans knowing that the public cannot complain legitimately that they have not been consulted at all stages. We are trying to get a balance on both sides here—the hard work done by conveners and officials on the one hand, and on the other the genuine interests of the public who ought to be consulted at every stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would respectfully suggest to the Committee, therefore, that we do not make the Amendment so proposed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must first of all make it plain that I never suggested that a voluminous document costing 10s. should be sent to every householder. I did, in the course of my speech, say that a postcard or a printed slip should be sent out telling him or her where he or she could get further information. I still think that is a reasonable idea, and I think the Minister does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to be certain that some such system will go into the regulations because for twelve years I have been raising this publicity point about planning, without satisfaction. Here is a chance, and I am a little doubtful whether I should let it go. In a way, I would like to vote on it. I would like to vote as a further protest. The right hon. Gentleman the Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) raised a question on Edinburgh, and I agree with all he said. I have a planning matter at Alnwickhill in my constituency. This is something which has already been decided once and, blow me down, here is the Corporation
	<span class='label label-info column'>90</span>
now starting it up again at great cost. That is the sort of injustice I wish to see avoided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regard these Amendments as serious. Is the Minister going to incorporate something in the regulations, or not, which will ensure that every person knows?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman can give writing lessons, either to my hon. Friend the Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Gordon Campbell) or to myself, he will have to wait till after the next Election. It would be contrary to the terms of his office to accept payment for that kind of service now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You want it free!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member said he was not sure whether it would be free or not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there are to be regulations incorporating these kinds of proposals, good and well, but that is not the way Clause 3(1) is worded at the moment. What Clause 3(1) says is that the local authority will decide for itself how it will operate this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested in what the Minister said. I appreciate that there are provisions for this in Clause 13. There is another Amendment standing in my name and the names of my hon. Friends for a new subsection on regulations. However, if it be the case that we are going to have all this governed by regulations, I must confess that could be a highly satisfactory way to do it, in my opinion, rather than by spelling out in detail in a public general Statute just what intimation or advertisement is to be made. But, of course, we do not know. It will be a matter for the Secretary of State, in his discretion, to promote regulations at a very much later stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to us that something has to be put into Clause 3(1) now to make it clear that we do not regard newspaper advertisements as satisfying the criteria laid down in the subsection. In other words, what we want is somehing in here now to make it quite clear that a local authority in its discretion will not be able to satisfy itself that adequate publicity is met simply by newspaper advertisements. I would have hoped that the Minister would have been prepared to accept some such indication of principle in this Clause
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0868">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>91</span>
rather than just leave it to a vague statement that perhaps we might manage to work out something about personal intimation in the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would ask the Minister if he would consider—I do not suggest that this is the right solution—the suggestion standing in the names of my hon. Friend the Member for Moray and Nairn and myself, whether that is the right Amendment, or whether the Amendment standing in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) is the right one. I must confess I can see in that kind of Amendment in this Clause difficulties which would not arise in the Clause dealing with local plans. Personal intimation would definitely be practicable, and more practicable in the local plan stage than in the structure plan stage. I would ask the Minister if he would consider having a look at this in order that something can be put into this rather waffly Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure if "waffly" is an English word, but I think the Committee know what I mean: it is all good stuff; it is a very nice public relations exercise; we cannot disagree with a word of subsection (1). Of course. We all agree that we want, as the Minister says, to incorporate the public at every stage. I do not believe for one moment that this will work out in practice in the way he thinks at the moment it will work out. Co-operation or consultation with the public at every stage is a fine theme. It sounds very well. I have my reservations as to how it could work out in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One thing I am quite clear about is that something more precise has to go into Clause 3(1) unless it is to be left as a general statement of intention or hope without any real legal sanction behind it. Would the Minister think about this and see if he cannot sharpen up the provisions of subsection (1) along the lines we have suggested?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like certainly to respond as favourably as I can to the Committee, but I really must come back to this point, that the regulations are the best way of putting this in. Remember what the position is at the moment. At the moment the only requirement to the local authorities is Section 8(2) of the 1947 Act. All it says there is that they are required to make a formal statutory
	<span class='label label-info column'>92</span>
advertisment. We are sweeping that away by this Clause. I do not for a moment accept the hon. Gentlemen's interpretation. He is too devoted to this concept that original sin is bound to triumph over all. If we make a new system, as Clause 3 essentially is, then in different parts of the country I agree it may operate more effectively or less effectively. I accept that, but the only offer to the Committee this morning is these three Amendments—one of which the hon. Gentleman does not like, one of which he takes the point of and does not want to have incorporated; and the only one left is the one about the newspaper intimation, which is what happens at the present time. So that Amendment is not adequate at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It says "in addition" to newspaper advertisements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That has got to be prescribed by further regulations. His Amendment adds nothing at all. It still leaves the Government with the task of putting it in regulations, in which case we have provided for this. We have provided for it in Clause 13.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A Committee is sitting to report on this matter. It has studied this problem for quite a long time. We have four excellent Scotsmen sitting on the Committee, one of whom I know personally. He is deeply interested in the way this would work in practice in Scotland and has discussed this with a number of people who are interested in planning. I know to a large extent what is being discussed in that Committee. To ask a Minister what will be in the regulations at this stage is asking too much.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I definitely cannot give the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South, (Mr. Clark Hutchison) the undertaking that in relation to structure plans his proposal will be incorporated. I have said in this Committee that it is one worthy of consideration which should be read alongside the Skeffington Report when it is published in July. There are other suggestions which should be considered alongside the Skeffington Report. The regulations have got to say a lot more than is said in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All we are arguing about at the moment is what the Bill should say. I have argued the case that we should not put in the word "adequately". I have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0869">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>93</span>
argued the case that we should not put in the phrase "to every householder". That is in relation to structure plans. I certainly do not think it is useful incorporating this Amendment which says "in addition to newspaper intimation".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I would say to the Committee that a lot of the arguments which the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South propounded were not about development plans. The kind of thing which upsets him—at least, this is what I have gathered over the years when I have heard him arguing with his own Party and with Ministers on our side—is the notification of planning applications. That raises an entirely different issue, but it is one which has to be looked at very carefully in the light of the Skefnngton Report. It is one it has accepted as something it must investigate and comment on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, it is only reasonable that I should rest my case in relation to these three Amendments on the plea to the Committee that it is far better that we write good regulations backed by Statute than that we write bad Statute and seek to amend it by regulation. I would ask the Committee to think about that in that spirit and not to press these Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe that the Minister has really understood the purpose of Amendment No. 105. We recognise that regulations which the Government will make will be coming out later, but we would like to be clear before this Bill leaves Parliament—and this could be done by the addition of the words proposed—that the notice will not be limited to newspaper notices and that other steps will be considered. We do not expect the Minister to spell out all the regulations at this stage, but if these words were included we should know that when the regulations are drafted other steps, as well as newspaper notices, will be taken into account. Our Amendment would achieve that. The Minister would not, when the Bill is going through Parliament, have to spell out the regulations intended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friends have pointed out, it is important that other steps should be available to be taken, such as, in certain circumstances, the sending of postcards to those concerned—though not, of
	<span class='label label-info column'>94</span>
course, the full document, such as the hon. Gentleman was suggesting in the very good line of argument he was making at one time. He is, of course, an expert at putting up an Aunt Sally and then knocking it down—usually on television broadcasts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you very much.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But I will not go further into that at this stage. Here again the hon. Gentleman was putting into the mouths of my hon. Friends something they had not at all suggested, and was then having a marvellous time knocking it down. They had in mind some form of notification which would not add a lot of money to the rates but would ensure that persons who might otherwise not hear of the proposals would receive a simple intimation which would put them on notice that proposals existed which they could examine. The Minister seemed to be getting the point of the Amendment only towards the end of his last speech. The Amendment would not make his regulations more difficult to draft at a later stage, but would merely ensure that we in this Committee, and hon. Members in the House when the Bill goes through it, could be sure that this provision would not be limited to newspaper notices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe everybody in this Committee would regard it as very unsatisfactory if all these general points of principle were left to be dealt with by regulation. I know that the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) would agree, because he has spoken on this many times in the past. While the details can be left to regulations, the point of principle should be made that there should be the possibility of other steps in addition to newspaper notices. That should be made clear in the Clause now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would, therefore, ask the Minister not to believe that this Amendment would in any way make it more difficult for the Government later, and to accept that it is not intended to get a complete draft of the regulations now. It certainly is not. But it is unsatisfactory to leave points of principle like these to be dealt with by regulation after the Bill is enacted. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will see the intention of this Amendment and will change his mind. If he does not do so I will invite my hon. Friends on this side of the Committee and other
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0870">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>95</span>
hon. Gentlemen who may think like us to support this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dempsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to know at this stage what steps will be proposed in addition to newspaper notices to publicise developments of this kind. We have been given some examples of those who should receive notices and one of the Gentleman has suggested that notices should go out to house owners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question we have to ask is, how can we make sure of attracting the interest of the general public in the developments that are taking place in their locality? That is the important thing. It is not easy. The present provision for advertising in the Press is full of loopholes. The building of a bingo hall in a community could be advertised in 	<i>The Glasgow Herald,</i> and might not be read by many people, instead of being advertised in the local Press, which people will read so that they will be knowledgeable about what is going on in their community. It would be helpful if a condition could be laid down providing that any such notice should appear in the local Press.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will find a more convincing and compelling means than newspaper advertisements for giving notice. I have no doubt that there are many people, manipulators, who will love to go right through these regulations to see if they can give them particular personal benefits. That is what is taking place today. I know of one instance, not long ago, of an entertainment hall being advertised in an unsatisfactory way. Obviously my hon. Friend must take steps to safeguard the public against any sharp practice. Where a condition is laid down that planning authorities must advertise such developments in a newspaper they should be required to advertise in a newspaper having a reasonable circulation in that particular area. That would be a proper safeguard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of our great problems is finding how we can interest people in local developments in which they may not be directly involved. I can understand the point made by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) with regard to people who may be directly involved through suffering particular loss through some development,
	<span class='label label-info column'>96</span>
but I hope my hon. Friend will bear in mind that local people ought to be notified at a very early stage in planning if they wish to be consulted, certainly long before the laws of the Medes and Persians are established and costs have been incurred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would ask him also to consider the importance of getting people interested and enthusiastic about participation. We all remember that France nearly collapsed because of a feeling of lack of participation, and we should be strengthening particpation in this field.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope my hon. Friend will keep these points in mind when considering the Skeffington report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to raise at this particular juncture a point which perhaps ought to be dealt with on the next Amendment, but I find it difficult, having read it, to reconcile this subsection with Clause 13 which gives the Secretary of State power to make regulations, since it seems to me that the subsection places in the hands of the local authorities power to do exactly as they think fit. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the local planning authority shall take such steps as will in their opinion secure … and the authority shall consider any representations made to them within the prescribed period."</p></blockquote>
I am not a lawyer. I am just an amateur always trying to learn about the law on this kind of thing, but this does not seem to be reconciled with Clause 13. Perhaps my hon. Friend will explain that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend will have noticed that I tried to argue the context of subsections (1), (2) and (3) based on subsection (4) of this Clause:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If after considering the statement submitted with, and the matters included in. the structure plan and any other information provided by the local planning authority, the Secretary of State is satisfied that the purposes of paragraphs (	<i>a</i>) to (c) of subsection (1) above have been adequately achieved …"</p></blockquote>
In other words, the arbiter, the one who decides what is adequate publicity, is the Secretary of State; and he founds his ability to achieve this adequacy on regulations he makes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the hon. Gentleman calls a point of principle is really less than half of a regulation, because if we were to incorporate this reference to newspapers—and I do not dispute that there will have to be newspaper advertisements—I would dispute putting the words in statute form
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0871">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>97</span>
because we find that in Clause 13(2) it is provided that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Regulations under this section may extend throughout Scotland or to specified areas only and may make different provisions for different cases."</p></blockquote>
That could be called "The 	<i>Glasgow Herald</i> or 	<i>Scotsman</i> argument" because a mere reference to a newspaper advertisement can, in the words of my hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge and Airdrie (Mr. Dempsey) prove totally inadequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One has, therefore, to be far more precise than the wording this Amendment seeks to achieve. The Amendment would not help in the making of regulations. If hon. Gentlemen opposite seek to divide the Committee that will not deflect the Government from making regulations as full and as sensible as they have to be, part in Statute and part in regulation. As the regulations apply to different parts of the country it is better to have them clear cut, making proper provision for newspaper advertisements instead of putting only half of it in the Statute. I would therefore ask my hon. and right hon. Friend's to reject these Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is putting this in a completely false light in suggesting that this Amendment, if passed, would mean that part of the regulations would then be in the Clause. That is ridiculous. All we are doing here is providing that the steps taken would not be restricted to notices in newspapers. If the Minister is suggesting that the inclusion of these words would have the effect of requiring that there must always be a notice in a newspaper in every
	<span class='label label-info column'>98</span>
case, and that such provision might be too restrictive, I would say that that is not the intention of the Amendment, and we might consider some way of dealing with that aspect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main intention, as it has been understood by a number of hon. and right hon. Gentlemen on both sides, is to make clear that the steps to be taken should not be restricted solely to notices in newspapers and that other methods should be taken into consideration, so that we all know before the Bill leaves the House that other steps as well as intimations in newspapers will be considered. It is not a question of formulating regulations during the discussion of this Clause, later to become a Section. We simply want to be clear, before we leave this part of the Bill, that the regulations will cover certain categories of notice. These words proposed would make that clear. If the Minister feels this suggestion too restrictive, perhaps in a situation where there is some very small plan for which, for some reason or other, there is no need for newspaper notice to be given, this point could be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I very much hope that there will be an opportunity for us to consider this further, before we come to a decision on this Amendment, and that therefore, we will not reach that decision this morning, in as much as we can continue with it at our next meeting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
