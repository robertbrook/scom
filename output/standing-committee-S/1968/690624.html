	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. N. R. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 2, in page 1, line 16, leave out 'passed or made' and insert 'enacted'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a very short drafting Amendment, which is really of a probing nature. Subsection (2)(a) refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"any statutory provision, whether passed or made before, on or after the date on which this Act comes into force".</p></blockquote>
and the effect of this Amendment would be to alter the wording to read,
	<br><blockquote><p>"any statutory provision, whether enacted before, on or after the date on which this Act comes into force".</p></blockquote>
There may or may not be significance in the term, "passed or made", but, if there is no significance, the word "enacted" may be more appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Norman Buchan)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, on the face of it, this seems sensible, since it is substituting one word for three. But there is a reason for the three. The word "enacted", in its normal usage, applies only to Statutes passed by Parliament, but in this subsection we have to cover subordinate legislation also, and Statutory Instruments are "made" by the appropriate Minister. It would be misleading, therefore, to use the word "enacted" in this context, since it would suggest that the subsection applied only to Acts of Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>(9) Section 4 of the Entail Amendment (Scotland) Act 1875 (consent to disentail may be given at 21) is hereby repealed.</p></blockquote>
I do not think I need speak at length about either this Amendment or the subsequent one, both of which are of a drafting nature. The first Amendment repeals Section 4 of the Entail Amendment (Scotland) Act, 1875, which is now spent, and which was included in error in Schedule 1 to the Bill. The second Amendment, which is consequential on the first, removes the reference to Section 4 from Schedule 1.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 4, in page 2, line 40, leave out subsection (3).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of this subsection, as I understand it, from what the Minister said on Second Reading, is that
	<br><blockquote><p>"… it is desirable to maintain a similar age of majority on both sides of the Border, it would be the Government's intention to synchronise the reduction in the age of majority in the two countries."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Scottish Grand Committee,</i> 25th March, 1969; c. 10.]</p></blockquote>
I do not think that matters one way or the other, because this Bill makes so little change in Scotland, as the Minister has all along recognised, that I doubt whether there is any need to wait till there is any change in England and Wales. I think the change in England and Wales is contemplated in Clause 1 of the Family Law Reform Bill, but why should we, in such an insignificant Measure as this, making so little change to the law of Scotland, have to wait till a very much more significant provision
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1385">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
is enacted in England and Wales? We recognise the differences in the laws of the two countries, and the need for this type of change in England and Wales, but that is their problem. I respectfully suggest that, in so far as this Bill is necessary at all, there is really no reason to delay its operation. It should become law after it has passed through the normal Parliamentary process, and it is not necessary to hold up the operation of this legislation as contemplated in subsection (3).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bucfcan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think it is correct to say that the only reason for introducing this subsection is to synchronise with a Measure affecting other parts of the United Kingdom, but I think it is useful to synchronise, and in legislation of this kind, affecting individuals, we should do it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think there is another reason. I accept that in its direct legal implications this Bill could be described as insignificant, although I would rather not describe it in that way, but symbolically it has quite a large and important connotation. If that is right, and if "symbolically" means quite a lot, it would be useful if time elapsed in order that people in the legal profession and the public in general should familiarise themselves with the passing of the Act. Therefore, it would seem better for us to specify a date on which Scotland at large would know that the change is taking place, which seems to me the more significant of the two reasons. Therefore, I would resist the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not at all satisfied with that reply. The Minister has shown some ingenuity, in introducing the later argument, but that was certainly not the view expressed by his hon. Friend during the Second Reading. What he said then was,
	<br><blockquote><p>"I should like to draw attention to Clause 2(3) which concerns the making of the commencement order. There is a similar provision in the Family Law Reform Bill."</p></blockquote>
For this reason:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… it is desirable to maintain a similar age of majority on both sides of the Border".—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Scottish Grand Committee,</i> 25th March, 1969; c. 10.]</p></blockquote>
That reason seems to have been dropped by the hon. Gentleman, and he has substituted the symbolic significance of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
proposal contained in this Bill, and the need for the legal profession and the public to familiarise themselves with this legislation before it operates. If this were a complicated or substantial change in the law there might be some argument in that, although it seems a novel doctrine to hold up the operation of general legislation to give the public time to read it. The public, and certainly the legal profession, are presumably fully familiar with what is going on in Parliament, and such a simple change as this is readily understood and appreciated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This subsection is an unnecessary bit of bureaucracy, and there is no reason at all why this simple, modest Measure should not be brought into force as soon as it gets the Royal Assent. Therefore, I ask the Minister not to be so tied to a Departmental decision, or whatever decision it was, on this matter, and to let the Scots have this modest change as soon as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The last time I remember a modest proposal being put forward it was something to do with the slaughter of the innocents. This has to do with the advancing of our young people to adulthood, and I think that its significance should be absorbed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to correct the hon. and learned Gentleman on one point. In referring to my hon. Friend's speech he quoted him as saying, "for this reason". What my hon. Friend, in fact, said, and it is quite significant, is,
	<br><blockquote><p>"For the reason that it is desirable…."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Scottish Grand Committee</i>, 25th March, 1969; c. 10.]</p></blockquote>
Of course, we accept that this reason is desirable, but it is not the only reason. It is good that we should synchronise in this way, but it is also useful that a symbolic Measure of this kind should be given time and added significance. But both arguments are not separate—there is nothing new in the argument which I have brought forward—and they are complementary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Now that the Minister has resisted our request that the operation of this legislation should not be withheld, can he tell us what are the Government's
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1386">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
intentions? When is it that he contemplates bringing this legislation into effect? He has taken a blanket power to bring about the operation of the legislation
	<br><blockquote><p>"on such date as the Secretary of State may appoint by order made by statutory instrument."</p></blockquote>
Can he give us some idea of when that is going to be? Is it going to be with the passing of the corresponding Clauses of the Family Law Reform Bill? Is the Family Law Reform Bill going to be brought into operation in a similar way, for which I think there is statutory provision? If so, it is all the more important to get some idea of when this legislation is likely to be effective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Member is quite right to draw attention to the fact that there is a similar provision in the Family Law Reform Bill. It would, therefore, not be brought into effect with the passing of the Family Law Reform Bill, but on an accepted date, mutually decided by the authorities both north and south of the Border, in the immediate future after the passing of that Bill. One might like to think of a useful definitive date of some kind, which could easily be accepted in the public eye, and there may be a symbolic date which would be useful for that. But, certainly, there is no intention of delaying the passing of the necessary order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

These Amendments add further provisions to the list contained in Schedule
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
1 of the various statutory references to the age of 21. Section 244(2)(a) of the Customs and Excise Act, 1952, provides that no entry on the official register containing particulars of the premises where an excise trade is carried on shall be valid unless the person making it is 21 or over. It is in accordance with the policy underlying the Bill that the age limit for this purpose should be reduced to 18. This particular provision was brought to our attention by the Board of Customs and Excise after the Bill had been introduced, and the first of these Amendments rectifies this omission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other Amendments are similar in purpose. They add to Schedule 1 a number of references to age 21 which appear in various Statutory Instruments, and which it is desired to alter to 18. These provisions, all connected with the holding of stock by people under the age of 21 who are domiciled in Scotland, were brought to our notice by the Bank of England and we were asked by the Treasury to make provision for their amendment, which we now do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no doubt that these Amendments are all necessary, but it is slightly worrying in a Schedule of this nature, to find such substantial and varied additions being made. I should have been happier if it had been technically possible for some kind of blanket change to have been made, instead of spelling out these statutory provisions which are the subject of amendment in this way. I hope we are not going to find endless changes required in this Schedule as the years pass, as more and more statutory provisions come to people's notice. However, I assume that it was technically not possible to make a blanket change, and that spelling out statutory alterations in this way is essential. I hope the Minister can satisfy us that, so far as he can see at the moment, there is no reasonable likelihood that any further omissions will be found in this Schedule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This is a Schedule of statutory provisions in respect of which it is provided that Section 1 of this Bill shall not apply. Paragraph 2 relates to the capacity for standing for Parliament or local government, and I am wondering if there is not an inconsistency of approach here on the part of the Government. We are told in Clause 1 of the Bill, in effect, that people will become of full age and capacity at the age of 18. Then we are told,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
in effect, that a person of that age will be unable to invoke the provisions of the Representation of the People Acts and the Local Government (Scotland) Act. Although he is of full age and capacity for practically every purpose one can imagine now—the age of marriage is not affected by this Bill in Scotland—nevertheless he is not regarded as fit to stand for Parliament or local government. I would be grateful if the Minister would give us the Government's views on this. Why, in regard to young people between 18 and 21, although they are to be accredited with all capacities and powers is this singular exclusion made?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To answer the last question first, it is not, in a sense, for me to explain that, but for Parliament, because we have just been passing a new Representation of the People Act in which this provision that people are entitled to stand at 21 remains unaltered, That, therefore, is the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have included this paragraph for two reasons. In the first place, it has always been the custom for the law concerning voting and the electorate to be contained in a single series of Statutes, and the inclusion of this paragraph makes it clear that that branch of the law is unaffected by this Bill. The question posed by the hon. and learned Member should have been put during the debate on the Representation of the People Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, while it is true that the voting age has been reduced to 18 that Act did not alter the age at which a person could stand for Parliament or as a candidate in a local government election. Section 50 of the 1947 Act provides that, to be qualified for nomination at a local government election in Scotland, a person must be "of full age". The proposed Amendment of the hon. and learned Gentleman would have the effect of reducing to 18 the age as "full age" at which a person could stand for election to a local authority, but this is not the Bill in which that policy should be carried out. If it should be carried out it should be in the Representation of the People Act. This Bill is dealing with a different problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am wondering if that is right. Parliament has said in the 1947 Act to take that example, that a person of full age will be entitled to stand as a

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
local government candidate. Fair enough. That has stood on the Statute Book for many years. The term "full age" is referred to in Clause 1(2). The purpose of Clause 1 is in effect to say this: people will become of full age at the age of 18 instead of at the age of 21. If that is a policy change which the Government have made I would have thought that this would indeed be the appropriate Measure in which to make the change. As with the numerous other statutory provisions which have to be altered and changed, and are listed in the First Schedule, so there could have been or might well have been a reference to Section 50 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are faced with a question of policy. If a person is going to be of full age at 18 for practically every purpose, why is he not going to be of full age for the purposes of Section 50 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1947? The Minister cannot dodge that issue. It may be that the Minister is right. It may be that a person is mature enough to vote for local government purposes at the age of 18 but not mature enough to stand as a candidate. I do not know. But there is a glaring inconsistency at the moment between paragraph 2 of the Second Schedule and the general object of this Bill, which is, as I understand it, to recognise the earlier maturity of young people today and to say that over a wide field they will be regarded as being of full age at 18. But it says to them, "Generally speaking you will be regarded as being of full age at 18, but we are not going to allow you to stand as a local government or Parliamentary candidate at 18."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says, "This is not the right Bill to make the change." I am asking why. The Minister has got round that by a technical argument that this is not the Bill to do it. There must have been some deliberate purpose in putting in this paragraph 2 in this Schedule. In my submission, it cannot be that there has been a Representation of the People Act which the House considered recently, and it cannot be that a change of this nature should be embodied in a new Local Government (Scotland) Act. It would be perfectly appropriate, in my submission, to deal with this problem in this Bill, and the Minister should not
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
wriggle out of this change of qualification on a purely technical argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will he not face up to the proposition that either he must explain why young people of 18 should be excluded in this way, or alternatively, treat the problem of Parliamentary and local government representation in the same way as other statutory provisions in the First Schedule are treated, and make the change?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to intervene in this interesting dialogue between the Front Benches, but I find myself in strong sympathy with my hon. Friend in this matter. It seems to me that it would be wholly inappropriate to introduce what is a profound constitutional change in a Bill dealing with the status of young persons. I have only the haziest recollections of Scots law, being by training an English lawyer, but there is a case which I recall which, I think, reached the House of Lords, concerning a lady licentiate of St. Andrew's University who, by virtue of a grant of a degree to her, claimed she was entitled to exercise the vote, and if I remember rightly—I am open to correction because this is a hazy recollection—the court stated that the Constitution of the country could not be changed by a side wind of this kind. If it is the intention of Parliament to change the law with regard to the eligibility of persons to stand for public office, this is a matter which does not fall appropriately nor squarely within a Bill of this kind, dealing with the capacity and status of young persons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. and learned Friend on a matter of principle. We are simply asking why every person who has reached the age of majority at 18 is not permitted to stand as a candidate. He is not bound to be elected, but I do not see why such persons should not put themselves forward as candidates if, in every other respect, they will be considered of age to do anything they like—except stand as candidates. I know they will be inexperienced and unlikely to be adopted, but I cannot see why they should not put themselves forward at local government elections if for some years they have shown particular interest in local government. It might in fact be a way of encouraging interest if young people could stand as candidates at 19, 20 or in their twenty-first year. There is a great deal to commend the

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
argument of my hon. and learned Friend and I should like the Minister to answer the question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is not necessarily a simple question. This is a profound constitutional matter. In this year there has been a Representation of the People Act which specifically reduced the voting age to 18 as a constitutional Measure. That had nothing to do with this Bill. If hon. Members had been as concerned as they say they are with introducing the right to stand for election in local government or Parliamentary elections they would have fought for it on the Floor of the House. I will put to them the simple question: did they fight for that on the Floor of the House when it could have been achieved, or are they merely putting the question here as a little propaganda point here where it cannot be achieved?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am shocked at the Minister accusing my hon. Friend and myself of making propaganda points. Nothing is further from our thoughts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Answer the question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Legislation is ultimately the responsibility of Governments. Here we have a Government who, a few months ago, introduced a Representation of the People Bill and introduced changes in the law relating to elections. At the same time they either had printed or had in contemplation a Bill reducing the age of majority to 18.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. I gave way for an answer to a simple question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No point of order arises.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Here we have a Government who were making changes in the Representation of the People Act and those changes did not include reduction to 18 the age of qualification for standing as a Parliamentary or a local government candidate. At the same time they were contemplating legislation, if indeed it had not already been published, to reduce the age of majority to 18. One must conclude from that that it was, presumably, a positive decision on the part of the Government, that while in practically every sphere of life full age will be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
reached at 18, because they elected to make no such provision in the Representation of the People Act, still that it would be better not to reduce to the age of 18 the qualification for standing for Parliament or local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I merely asked—it was an innocent question with no propaganda content—why the Government had taken this view. They have reduced the voting age to 18 in one Bill and they are making substantial changes with regard to the general age of capacity in this Bill. Why did they not marry the two up and provide, either in this Bill or in the other Measure, that it would be competent to stand as a local government or Parliamentary candidate at 18? All we have had from the Minister in reply is the technical argument that this would not be the appropriate Bill in which to do it. I agree that it might have been better to have done it in the Representation of the People Bill, but this is a short Measure affecting Scotland and we are entitled to raise this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends and I are dissatisfied with the Minister's reply, because he gave no explanation. He virtually conceded that this is Government policy and tried to throw the onus on to us by asking why we did not do something about it. Why is the age of capacity to be 18 over a wide field except in this limited respect of standing as a Parliamentary or local government candidate? We have not had a proper answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had only started to speak, and I gave way so that the hon. and learned Gentleman might answer a simple question, which was: did the Opposition press for this when they could have done so? We have had a long speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry. I thought that the Minister had finished.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I made it clear by my point of order that I had merely given way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Seven minutes ago I put the simple question: did the Opposition press for this when they could have done so? I am still waiting for a simple answer "Yes" or "No". I am willing to give
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1390">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
way if the hon. and learned Gentleman wants to give that answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is obvious. We did not press for this. The Under-Secretary knows that. What is the point of wasting time by asking a question to which the answer is obvious?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I now know the answer. The Opposition did not press for this. It has taken the Opposition seven minutes to confess that, when they could have raised this point, which they now say they are so concerned about, to allow young people of 18 to stand for Parliamentary or local government elections, they did not do so. They know full well that it cannot be done in the Bill, that it would be a constitutional impropriety to attempt to do it in the Bill. This is why I say that it is a mere propagandist attempt. The Opposition have been hoist on their own petard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have every sympathy with the proposition that we should recognise the responsibility of young people, but Parliament in its wisdom did not necessarily agree with me or with hon. Members opposite, apparently. Three months ago hon. Members opposite did not even agree about this themselves. It may have been that Parliament thought that it was correct that young people should assume responsibility for their own actions by having the vote at 18 but were not sufficiently mature to be responsible for other people by standing for Parliament or local government at 18. I do not know. The point was not raised by the hon. and learned Gentleman then so that it could have been properly and appropriately answered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be out of order if I pursued on this Bill a Representation of the People Act point, much as I would like to do so. The Opposition have wriggled on the end of a technicality for the last 10 minutes. We have to make mention of these Acts in this paragraph for the simple reason that the appropriate Measures—the various Representation of the People Acts, particularly the 1947 Act—refer to "full age". Parliament clearly intends the right age for that purpose to be 21. We therefore have to include this paragraph so that the wishes of Parliament, which hon. Members
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
opposite did not oppose, may be carried out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to prolong the discussion unduly, but I do not like listening to our argument being deliberately misrepresented by the Under-Secretary. We are not pressing this point. We are not making a scene about it. We are merely asking why the Government think that 18 is an appropriate age for practically all other purposes but not for standing as a Parliamentary or local government candidate. The only answer we have had is that this is not the appropriate Bill to deal with the matter. That may or may not be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of what representations were made on earlier legislation, it is fair to point out that Parliament had not been asked to consider reducing the age of majority to 18. Parliament had not at that time been asked to consider the question of the reduction of the age of majority or full age and capacity to 18, so at that time we were taking the law as it then stood.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition could have tabled an Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Voting at 18 is one thing. Standing for Parliament at 18 is another. At that time full age and age of capacity was 21. It would have been inappropriate to have started an argument about a generally effective reduction in the age of majority to 18 at a time when no such Bill was before Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Bill seeks to reduce the age of majority to 18, to establish full age and capacity at 18. Our innocent question is: is it not appropriate when this is being done, to make a simple change to the Representation of the People Act in the same way? We have not been given an answer, except to the effect that this is not an appropriate piece of legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
