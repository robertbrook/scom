	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed</i> [	<i>15th April</i>], in page 4, line 17, after 'steps' insert 'in addition to newspaper intimation'. [	<i>Mr. Wylie.</i>]</p>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the conclusion of our last Sitting I explained that the Minister had misunderstood the purpose of the Amendment. I hope that, having considered the matter between then and now, he recognises that our proposal does not have the consequence which he seemed to attach to it and that it would simply be helpful in making it clearer what the regulations will cover. My hon. Friends are not seeking to draft the regulations now and put them in the Bill. I trust that, on reflection, the Minister will give a more favourable response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Dr. J. Dickson Mabon)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having had an opportunity of reading the OFFICIAL REPORT of what was said at our second Sitting, I have indeed been impressed by what I said on that occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Gordon Campbell) commented,
	<br><blockquote><p>"… I would say that that is not the intention of the Amendment"—to be too restrictive—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"and we might consider some way of dealing with that aspect".—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 15th April, 1969; c. 98.]</p></blockquote>
If one writes any part of an intention into a Statute one is bound to some extent to qualify the regulations that are
	<span class='label label-info column'>100</span>
to be made, not only by commission but by omission, for people might argue, "Why are these facts left out of the regulations?" I am not arguing against newspaper advertising as being a proper way of going about this exercise, along with other forms of publicity, to ensure that knowledge of these matters is widespread. However, an Amendment of this kind would confuse rather than strengthen the regulations. A Statute should be tidy, and words should not be inserted merely for the sake of inserting them. When hon. Gentlemen opposite read the regulations they will see that there is just as good an argument for forms of publicity in addition to newspaper advertising.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having given this explanation, I hope that we can proceed, because this is a trivial matter on which there is no substantial difference of view between hon. Members on both sides. It is simply a question of whether or not these words should be incorporated in the Bill. I strongly advise the Committee not to incorporate them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. G. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There seems to be a misunderstanding between us over this. The Minister agrees that notices in newspapers are necessary. However, that is not the point of the Amendment. Our main argument is that there should be action in addition to newspaper advertisements and that that should be considered in making the regulations. The hon. Gentleman is assuming, simply because the Amendment mentions newspapers as one method of intimation, that that is the end of the story. We believe that means of publicity in addition to newspapers should be employed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Dickson Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The situation is becoming ridiculous. I have acknowledged to hon. Members that a Committee is considering this problem of how regulations should be framed on a Great Britain basis. I have indicated that there will be regulations. I have explained that reference should be made to newspapers and that the situation under the 1947 Act—hon. Gentlemen opposite did nothing to mitigate that when they had ample opportunity to do so—is defective. We seem to be arguing about nothing. By rejecting the Amendment we are not saying that there should not be regulations. That would be absurd. We are making no attempt in the Bill to say what
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0875">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>101</span>
the regulations should be, because that matter will depend on the recommendations of the Skeffington Committee. They will be discussed by Parliament. The regulations will be made on a Great Britain basis because the English and Welsh are just as concerned as the Scots about this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although the Minister says that there is confusion, it really exists only in his own mind, since we are merely laying down a minimum standard with which we expect local planning authorities to comply. There would be more force in the hon. Gentleman's opposition to the Amendment if he thought that there would be occasions when newspaper intimation would not be necessary. We want at least to guide local planning authorities in the direction in which they should go by emphasising the obligations which they have previously had. We want to clarify the position, and I therefore hope that the Minister will give the matter further thought.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot understand why hon. Gentlemen opposite are causing such a fuss over this. If the Amendment were accepted local planning authorities would have to advertise these matters in the Press.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. N. R. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Since it is Conservative policy to go in for a vast network of local commercial radio stations, half the local Press will be wiped out. They will not be available for advertising purposes. Instead of gimmicky thinking on the part of hon. Gentlemen opposite, I trust that they will indulge in some constructive thought. All this political nonsense—which, in any event, they indulge in so poorly—will get us nowhere, and I trust that they will withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I originally moved the Amendment, perhaps I may be allowed to say a few more words about it before we move on. First, however, I must tell the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) that his contribution today was not up to its usual high standard of fluency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister argued that it is wrong in principle to suggest one method of intimation in a Clause like this, leaving
	<span class='label label-info column'>102</span>
the rest to regulations later, because to do so would restrict the scope of those regulations and result in confusion. That is nonsense. After all, Clause 1(3) sets out in detail a variety of circumstances which must be taken into account in carrying out the survey. Clause 1(3,	<i>e</i>) refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"such other matters as may be prescribed or as the Secretary of State may in a particular case direct".</p></blockquote>
It is, therefore, nonsense to suggest that it is inconsistent to insert a positive provision—in this case newspaper advertising—when we are to have regulations dealing with the whole sphere of intimation and publication. If that is the only argument the Minister can adduce, it is a weak one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the Amendment is not to indicate the type of intimation which is to be given, to be supplemented by what is stated in the regulations, but to write in a positive requirement. That requirement is that, in addition to newspaper intimation, such further steps will be taken as would satisfy the local authority that adequate publicity is being given, along with other matters which may be prescribed. Newspaper intimation alone will not be enough. Part of the trouble with planning in Scotland—no doubt, the same can be said of planning in England and Wales—is the lack of communication between the planners and the planned. If we are to give teeth to the pious hopes expressed in the Clause, newspaper advertising alone will not be sufficient. However, I cannot think of a more essential way of proceeding than by newspaper advertising. That principle must be followed, and the other matters can be decided later, both by local authorities in their discretion under the Clause and by regulations prescribed by the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment reflects our concern that the Clause, which deals with publicity, should be more than a waffle. If the Minister is not prepared to accept an Amendment along these lines, we beg leave to doubt the seriousness with which the Government are approaching this whole problem of communication and publicity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There was a threat at our last Sitting that there might be a Division on the Amendment. Since I shall be voting in a certain way, if a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0876">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>103</span>
vote takes place, I feel obliged to make my thoughts on the subject clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This seems to be a storm in a teacup. It seems unimportant whether or not the Amendment is accepted, for the proposal would make little difference. Subsection (1) says that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the local planning authority shall take such steps as will in their opinion secure …"</p></blockquote>
what hon. Members require. That means that the necessary steps will be taken to provide publicity for a structure plan. There is also provision in subsection (4) that the Secretary of State must be satis-</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 101, in page 4, line 17, leave out 'in their opinion'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This point was referred to in our debate on Thursday by the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) and is something upon which we should like a statement from the Minister. The question of the steps that should be taken is qualified by what in the opinion of the local planning authority secures the necessary publicity; the words "in their opinion" are extremely important. Therefore, we move this Amendment so that the Government may explain why the whole question of publicity and its importance—and I think that both sides of the Committee are agreed on how important it is—is qualified by the opinion of the local authority. One would hope that local authorities will be enlightened in the way in which they deal with these matters and that they will be 100 per cent. efficient none the less, it is left to them as a matter of opinion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should like to know from the Government what difficulties would be created if these words were taken out. Will the Minister tell us it would then be extremely difficult for anyone to decide what should be the criteria? This is a very important point. We wish to know from the Government why it is</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>104</span>
	<p>fied that the purposes referred to in subsection (1) have been fulfilled.</p>
	<p>I have thought very hard about this, and have listened to the arguments at the last Sitting and this morning, and I really can see no reason for the Amendment. I repeat, this is a storm in a teacup and if there is a Division I shall vote against the Amendment.</p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the Amendment be made:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 5. Noes 11.</p>
	<p>necessary for these words to be in the Clause and what remedy a citizen might have if he believed that not enough publicity was being given in circumstances where his opinion was different from that of the local authority.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The esssential point is that as the Bill is drafted the local planning authority will not be the final arbiter as to what steps are adequate. The effect of the words "in their opinion" is to limit challenge in the courts of the adequacy of publicity, but it does not prevent the Secretary of State from imposing firm obligations by way of regulations. We have had a long discussion on the nature of regulations that would flow from the Skeffington Committee and why that Committee exists, and also why we are so concerned about public participation in planning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am very much obliged to the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. James Davidson) for emphasising the importance of subsection (4) of this Clause, because the whole Clause has to be read together, not just taken in parts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's earnest intention is that there should be public participation in planning on a scale which we have not known before. Despite the remarks made by the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) that is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0877">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>105</span>
very true; it is one of the mainsprings of this Bill. I should like to assure the hon. Gentleman the Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Gordon Campbell) that the effect of the words "in their opinion" is to limit the challenge in the courts of the adequacy of publicity, but it does not prevent the Secretary of State from imposing firm obligations by way of regulations. I think he will then see the importance of those three words which he seeks to delete.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the Minister has said that the reason why the Government have put these words in is that it is a protection for the local authorities from the courts. Here again, I would refer to what the right hon Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) said at our last meeting. I am sorry that he did not agree with us in dealing with the last Amendment. The Minister has now replied saying that the Secretary of State will, through regulations, impose obligations; but our complaint, in the Amendment which has just been discussed, is that, in this Committee, we have very little control over what is going to be in those regulations. Even the simple general point we want to make, that there should be methods in addition to advertising in newspapers, was not accepted by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now, in dealing with this Amendment, the Minister refers us to the regulations as being the way to ensure that the local authority is not the judge in its own case. That is unsatisfactory. I should have hoped that the Minister could have accepted our last Amendment. Then we would not have minded so much about this Amendment. The point made by the right hon. Member at the meeting on Tuesday was that the Minister said that this is necessary in order to protect the local authority. I see that point, but it makes it all the more unfortunate that the Minister could not have accepted the simple Amendment which we moved earlier, because that would have ensured that at least we were satisfied about a general point which would be covered in the regulations. We do not want to go into the regulations in detail, but the Minister has said in his reply that the regulations are the safeguard. I wish that the Minister and the Government in general would accept the principle that Parliament should be able to lay down
	<span class='label label-info column'>106</span>
the guidelines and the general points, not going into detail, because this Bill, in my opinion, leaves far too much to be dealt with later in the regulations, not just details but also general principles. The combination of the Government's attitude both to this Amendment and to the last Amendment means that this Committee and the House of Commons in general are being left in the air on general points as well as on details. I am sorry that the Minister was not able to accept the last Amendment, if he cannot accept this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am still not clear about this. Subsection (1) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"When preparing a structure plan for their district and before finally determining its content for submission to the Secretary of State, the local planning authority shall take such steps as will in their opinon secure …"</p></blockquote>
that seems to me to give a legal right to a local authority to do what it wants to do. Then Clause 13 states,
	<br><blockquote><p>"Without prejudice to the foregoing provisions of this Part of this Act".</p></blockquote>
In other words, the legal right conferred upon the local authority is without prejudice; it can fulfil the purposes set out here without prejudicing that right. It then goes on to say that the Secretary of State may make regulations affecting precisely those things for which the local authority has been given legal authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am bound to say that I find it very difficult to reconcile those two Clauses. I think that is due to the words "in their opinion". It seems to me that those words are very specific; it is not in the Secretary of State's opinion, nor in accordance with the regulations laid down by the Secretary of State. I could have understood that if it had stated that the local planning authorities should take "such steps in accordance with regulations laid down by the Secretary of State", but I cannot understand the Bill as it is at the present time. I should have thought that the hon. and learned Member for Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) would have had something to say about that. I am a humble bookseller, not a lawyer, but it does seem to me that this makes a nonsense of the Bill. Many legal provisions make no sense, but this certainly seems to be contradictory. I cannot understand it at all. With the greatest respect to him, my hon. Friend has not really explained this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0878">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>107</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am bound to say that I agree with the Minister that this Amendment could not be accepted, because what the Clause does, as inevitably it has to do, is to impose a subjective test rather than an objective one. It must be left to the discretion of someone as to whether satisfactory publicity has been given; that someone may be either the Secretary of State or the local authority. What I do not think is practicable is to apply an objective test, whereby one every occasion a dissatisfied member of the public, when inclined, would be able to test the exercise of that discretion in a court of law. Even if he failed more often than he succeeded, he would be able to argue in a court of law and could hold up the whole process of planning by asking the courts to decide whether in the circumstances publicity in a particular case had been adequate. Therefore, I agree that one has to leave it as it stands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But my hon. Friend the Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Gordon Campbell) pointed out that that is just the difficulty. There are no regulations at present; there is no power to make regulations at the moment. We are going to part with this Clause in the Bill in a situation in which the whole thing is left entirely to the discretion of the local authority, subject to the provisions of subsection (4). In other words, there is really nothing in this Clause which does more than express the pious hope that there is going to be ample publicity, which is one of the reasons why we wanted to put something right at the base above which one has to go in order to satisfy that standard. We were seeking to introduce some objective criteria while leaving a wide area of discretion to the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, that has been rejected by the Committee, and personally I cannot see any way of handling this kind of problem other than by leaving it to the local authority in its discretion, in the expectation, which I think is justified on the whole, that it will honour its statutory obligations properly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very glad that the hon. and learned Gentleman added that last phrase, because one begins to despair of the belief amongst many people that local authorities do not do their job properly. One always hears of the bad
	<span class='label label-info column'>108</span>
local authorities. One never hears of the good ones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In defence of local authorities, I must say that they have been operating under a very difficult system, and in spite of the fact that it has lasted for a long time and has not been amended. As we said earlier, in the previous Sitting, they have had to draft plans, to go into them, and then to publicise them; to reach a stage where objections are often, in their minds wrongly, too late; and they then have to unravel problems and spend a great deal more money in making their plans all over again. I cannot altogether blame the local authorities for what has happened in the past. It is an easy alibi. Perhaps we should have reformed the Statute long ago, when it was quite clear that the planners and the planned were not all that close together, but if there was any fault in delaying reform of the Statute, it lies with the Opposition, not with us, because we have sought to amend the Statute when we received the Planning Advisory Group Report, and had discussed it with the authorities. We have promptly sought to amend the Statute, when we got the Planning Advisory Group Report, and had discussed it sufficiently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that the hon. and learned Gentleman, who is a very fair man, although I do not always regard his interventions as fair—he can occasionally be a politician as well as a lawyer and sometimes a very unfair politician—has on this occasion excelled himself in fairness. He has pointed out what every lawyer knows, that if we take out these words we endanger the whole position. Among those who are opposed to planning, the anti-planners, and there are many in the party opposite, there are those who want no change at all, and they will fight any change to the bitter end, at great expense to themselves and others often. They will attempt to defeat any local authority, even one of the same political colour, which wants to make any change. If we removed these words we could go on 	<i>ad infinitum</i> arguing whether publicity had been adequate. No doubt these matters would go to the courts. They have been to the courts before. That is why I suggest to the Committee that it is very dangerous, from the point of view of good planning, to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0879">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

I would quarrel with my hon. Friend who suggested that lawyers are so much fairer than politicians. I hope that we will not be arguing over pernickity points.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This was a probing Amendment and it has enabled the Minister to state that these words were to protect local authorities in the courts. My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) has pointed out that as the Bill is drafted, this would be necessary. We regretted that another change has not been made which would have made it clearer to the citizen that a small advertisement in the newspaper could not be considered enough. What the hon. Member for Motherwell said
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0880">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>111</span>
was exactly what we were arguing, that we did not think that newspaper advertisements were enough. The whole question of the adequacy of publicity is something with which the public will have to deal when they are caught up in structure plans, once the Bill becomes an Act. Other methods of informing the public, such as have been mentioned from this side of the Committee, the sending of postcards to householders for example, are the sorts of things which will have to be covered by regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the reasons already given we do not propose to press this Amendment. What we wanted to do was to get a statement from the Government as to why these words were necessary, and why it should be discretionary for the local authority. Accordingly, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 4, in page 4, line 30, at end insert 'of the report and'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As this Clause stands, the local planning authority is only obliged to make copies of the plan available to the public. The effect of our Amendment is that, in addition, the report should be made available. The structure plan is based on a survey of the district and the survey is already, under Clause 2(1), made available to the Secretary of State. It is obligatory on the local planning authority to send a report to him. We feel that while the Secretary of State has the available background information on which to judge the plan, as the Bill stands that background information is not available to the general public, and that this should be made available to interested members of the public, because it would help them to judge the plan and form an opinion. If the Amendment is accepted it would ensure that the public participate more in planning, because they will understand it more, and that will ensure that, if there are objections to the plan, they are better and more reasonable, based on fact rather than opinion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Doig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If a layman collects a report and a plan, will there be contained in the report sufficient details of any departures from existing accepted practice? At Second Reading I spoke of what happened in my constituency
	<span class='label label-info column'>112</span>
when the planning committee, of which I was a member, was presented with plans on which roads were narrower than ever before, drains were farther apart than ever before, and the camber on the road was less than it had ever been. The result was that our roads were so narrow that there was insufficient room for two buses to pass each other. No one would have agreed to this if he had known. It was not drawn to our attention. I want to make sure that this sort of thing does not happen again. The badly planned drains and the roads still cause regular flooding of the main street. A layman, even with a structure plan and the report, could not detect this. The report will have to draw attention specifically to any departure from existing planning practice. I am sure the mistakes which occurred in my constituency would not have happened if this had been done. As well as having access to the structure plan and the report, attention should be drawn to any departure from the existing practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may take the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Doig), it is usually the custom in various authorities—and this is particularly true of Dundee—to have certain understandings within their own department about the standards of roads. I do not know this particular instance, but it would be under present planning practice. If we were looking at actual areas within the City of Dundee the kind of thing my hon. Friend is seeking would have to be demonstrated, but the standard of road design or maintenance would be that expected in Dundee, according to whatever classification that authority seeks to adopt. If it proposed to depart from that standard within any specific action area, whether for redevelopment or otherwise, it would indicate the fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the argument adduced by the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith), which is a good argument, that alongside the structure plan there should be some material of different kinds which will help the general public to appreciate why the structure plan has been evolved in this particular way. Those of us who have seen surveys and then, later on, have seen the conclusions in the form of plans, realise
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0881">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>113</span>
that a lot of the survey report material is overtaken by new information of different kinds. Sometimes it can be cancelled out by a change in circumstances, and some of it is irrelevant. Those of my hon. Friends who visited the team at Edinburgh University which was preparing the Borders Study would find difficulty in comprehending a great deal of the planning techniques. Also on Tayside, if they go to Mr. Derek Lyddon and Professor Campbell's survey they will see this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right that alongside the structure plan there should be material which is relevant and is understandable to the general public. If it is necessary and desirable that certain things should be done then not the local authority but the Secretary of State should ensure that this material is available along with the structure plan. That is why subsection (1,	<i>a</i>) also requires that during the preparation of the structure plans the local authority must take such steps as will in their opinion secure that adequate publicity is given to the report of the survey. Therefore the survey will already have been available to the public during the formative stage of the structure plan. If it is not so available then the system we are proposing has fallen down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (3) requires the planning authority to give the Secretary of State a statement along with the structure plan, and if the Secretary of State is not satisfied he can return the plan and direct the authority to take such further action as he specifies. There is also power under Clause 13(1,	<i>f</i>) under which the Secretary of State can require a local planning authority
	<br><blockquote><p>"to provide persons making a request in that behalf with copies of any plan or document which has been made public for the purpose mentioned in Section 3(1)(	<i>a</i>)".</p></blockquote>
In other words, the only difference between the Amendment and what is proposed in the Bill is that in the former case it will be a strict obligation, no matter how irrelevant, confusing, out-of-date or superseded, for the material to be on show in every case. That is, perhaps, not helping the general public at all. I agree that it is meant to help, but I would like the proposer of the Amendment to look at the design of the Bill and see that the Government take the point that all
	<span class='label label-info column'>114</span>
material that is desirable in order to help the general public to get an appreciation of the structure plan should be made available. With this Clause and Clause 13 I think the Secretary of State is in a position to see that this is done in cases where it is desirable. Therefore I ask the hon. Gentleman to agree that his Amendment is already to some extent part of the Bill, although it is not absolutely spelled out in firm, rigid terms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to ask the Minister one or two questions. It is perfectly true that regulations may be enacted and they may include provisions such as are set out in Clause 13(1,	<i>f</i>), but it is difficult to visualise any circumstance in which the survey report would be so overtaken by events between the completion of the report and the preparation of the structure plan as to make the report irrelevant, confusing and all the other things which the Minister suggested it might become. When the Minister uses this kind of argument one always begins to wonder whether there is not a sound reason for pressing for this kind of report to be made available. There may be the odd occasion when it is superseded, but in the ordinary case I would have thought the report would not be superseded by events to that extent, and the only way in which the public, and in particular their professional advisers, would be in a position to assess the structure plan properly would be by also having available the report on which that structure plan proceeds. Presumably, except in the most exceptional circumstances—and I cannot visualise circumstances so exceptional as to fit this case—the structure plan will be based substantially on what is to be found in the report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that the report might be irrelevant, or confusing, or incapable of being understood, at another stage the hon. Gentleman said, "But in any event the public will have seen the report". When, and in what circumstances? This is throwing us back to the general expression of hope that there will be consultation at all stages. But we must be realistic. It is no use talking in glib terms about consultation at all stages without having regard to the practicality of it. It is not envisaged that 300,000 citizens in Edinburgh will wish to consult the planning authority in regard to the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0882">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>115</span>
preparation of a structure plan at all stages. When are the public who are interested, and their consultants who act for them, going to get this report if they do not get it when the structure plan is made available for inspection?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not an Amendment one would be prepared to press, but it is difficult to see why, in all cases where the structure plan is available for inspection, the report should not be made available also. That does not seem to me to be an unreasonable imposition to place on a planning authority, and if we mean what we say about improving the relations between the planning authority and the planned I would have thought this was one of the provisions which could be incorporated in this Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think it will be convenient to the Committee if we take with the next Amendment, No. 5, also Amendment No. 14, in Clause 7, page 8, line 27, after "inspection", insert

	<br><blockquote><p>"by any person wishing to inspect them".</p></blockquote>
This is a short Amendment. As the Clause reads at the moment the plan is to be made available for inspection
	<br><blockquote><p>"at their office and at such other places".</p></blockquote>
All this Amendment seeks to do is to specify to whom this opportunity for inspection is to be made available, to avoid any complications as to entitlement to inspect. It would simply read
	<br><blockquote><p>"inspection by any person wishing to inspect them".</p></blockquote>
In fact the word "them" would now have to become "it", since the report is not included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that language is to be found in the Countryside Act and the Police (Scotland) Act, 1967, and if it was justified in the one case I think it is justified also in this case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened to what has been said by the hon. and learned Gentleman, but, in my view, and also in the view of my advisers, the words proposed do not appear to add anything to the provision. The words "available for inspection" mean what they say, namely, for inspection by anyone. So if these
	<span class='label label-info column'>116</span>
words are included then either nothing is added to the sense—in which case the Amendment is unnecesary—or it could be argued that by adding these words there might be some kind of limitation to the right of inspection. For example, it might be argued that, because these words are included, one must formally express a wish to inspect, which would be undesirable. I cannot think of other circumstances in which these words might be restrictive, but perhaps the Committee might dwell on this for a moment and think of the other circumstances. As the Amendment does not seem to have a positive quality I suggest the hon. and learned Gentleman does not press it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will certainly not press it, but I would have thought that, in the context of this Bill, the right to inspect a structure plan might well be interpreted as being restricted to those who have an immediate interest to do so, in particular, those who might be affected by the planning proposals. It is arguable that it would not be competent for any member of the public at the other end of the country who might be interested in these proposals for some oblique consideration but who is not directly affected by them, to be told, "It is nothing to do with you and you are not entitled to see these". The Minister apparently thought it necessary to put these words into the 1967 legislation, either the Countryside Act or the Police (Scotland) Act, but now he does not think it is necessary. As he has his expert advisers in these matters I presume this is the right interpretation, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suggest that with the next Amendment, No. 6, we take also Amendment No. 15, in Clause 7, page 8, line 28, after 'prescribed', insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'and copies, including reproductions of the plan and of such diagrams and illustrations on such scale as may be appropriate, shall be made available by them on sale to the public at a reasonable cost'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 6, in page 4, line 33, after 'prescribed', insert:

	<span class='label label-info column'>117</span>
may be appropriate, shall be made available by them on sale to the public at a reasonable cost'.</p></blockquote>
I regard this as a rather more important Amendment than some we have been considering, because we are dealing here with the structure plan, and by the later Amendment, No. 15, with the local plan, but I am directing my observations primarily towards the structure plan at the moment. We are dealing essentially with a comprehensive written statement, because a structure plan will presumably be a comprehensive plan, perhaps even in the nature of a regional plan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
In these circumstances, and I have discussed this with one or two well-known planning consultants in Scotland, it is absolutely essential that there should be the opportunity not merely to inspect structure plans, with their associated maps and diagrams, at the office of the planning authority and other places, but also the right to take copies away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 13(1,	<i>f</i>) provides for copies to be made available at reasonable cost:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… such regulations may—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(	<i>f</i>) require a local planning authority, in such cases as may be prescribed or in, particular cases … to provide persons making a request in that behalf with copies of any plan or document which has been made public for the purpose mentioned in section 3(1)(	<i>a</i>) or 7(1)(	<i>a</i>) of this Act …"</p></blockquote>
Paragraph (	<i>g</i>) provides:
	<br><blockquote><p>"for the publication and inspection of any structure plan or local plan which has been approved, adopted or made".</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister say whether Clause 13(1,	<i>f</i>) means that the structure plan, diagrams and illustrations, before they have been approved by the Secretary of State, may be made available at a reasonable charge, or that they are not to be made available at a reasonable charge till the plan has been "approved, adopted or made"?. I think that the word "adopted" refers to the local plan, because of the peculiar procedure thereon. It is essential that provision should be made to provide the opportunity for purchasing these plans before they have been adopted and at the stage when they are submitted to the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The appropriate place for the incorporation of that provision is in Clause 3 and in the associated Clause. Anyone read-
	<span class='label label-info column'>118</span>
ing the provisions of Clause 13(1) should be able to know at a glance what he is entitled to do, and an Amendment along these lines should be incorporated in Clause 3(1) and in the associated Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not quite so important that there should be this opportunity for the local plan. It is the structure plan which will constitute the problem. It is so extensive and so expansive and, being substantially a written statement, it should be made available at a reasonable charge at the earliest stage, even before approval has been given by the Secretary of State. This provision should properly be incorporated in this Clause rather than in Clause 13 where it may or may not be covered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The difference between us is whether the provision should apply to all stages or at one definitive stage; whether we should be selective or comprehensive. It would be surprising if many people in the Clyde Valley, for example, were prepared to pay a stiff price for a document which is not even the finished structure plan but only the proposed structure plan submitted for approval. The fewer the purchasers, the higher the price, and obviously someone must pay the difference if the price is brought down to make it a reasonable price.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do we know what the Clyde Valley plan costs?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Offhand I cannot say what it costs. I would guess it costs £2, but I would not like to be held to that. I doubt whether many people would be prepared to purchase these plans. Remember, they are quite substantial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment involves both the structure plan and local plans in all cases and at all stages. While the Skeffington Committee might be prepared to recommend to the Secretary of State and to the other Ministers that the regulations should apply the provisions of Clause 3 so that the Secretary of State can determine what material should be available to the public at any stage, may be in the formative stage, I cannot hold the Skeffington Committee to this. Although the Committee might make this recommendation in the selective form at that stage, it may not be in favour of it at every stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0884">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>119</span>
Clause 13(1,	<i>f</i>) is very important in relation to the stage of the structure plan. I was asked whether Clause 13(1,	<i>f</i>) would be applicable at the stage prior to submission to the Secretary of State, and the answer is, Yes, it would. At that stage the Secretary of State would see that selectivity, according to the circumstances of the case, would be applied. If he were not satisfied with what the local authority was doing, the Secretary of State might be anxious that the public should be given adequate time to see the plans in the earlier stages, and there is sufficient provision for this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I have to say about the local plans is even stronger. The Opposition accused me of putting up a straw man in the argument about an earlier Amendment on sending the details to every householder. That is what this proposal about the local plan would amount to. It would be just as expensive, perhaps even more expensive, to produce some local plans which are in considerable detail, street by street, plot by plot, with all the coloured diagrams and descriptions of use, change of use, and so on, as it would be to produce a Metra report. After all, the Metra report is a broad canvas of strategy over a large area, but dealing only with six or seven propositions. The local plan may be dealing with thousands of propositions, and we are talking about the preliminaries to the local plan, and this could be quite expensive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is better not to put an absolute obligation in the Statute to impose this "other stage" availability at reasonable cost, because it would not work. It would slow down the whole procedure, make it immensely expensive, and frustrate much of the planning, which, I am sure, is not the intention of this and the associated Amendment. The matter should be left as it is, with Clause 13(1,	<i>f</i>)—which I notice is, later on, proposed to be deleted——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Consequentially.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case it is important that we should preserve Clause 13(1,	<i>f</i>). I suggest that it would be wrong for the Committee to accede to the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a little worried about this. The deletion of paragraph (	<i>f</i>) would follow on the acceptance of some such
	<span class='label label-info column'>120</span>
Amendment as the one we are discussing. If Clause 3 contained a statutory obligation for this to be done, there would be no need to refer to the discretionary obligation in Clause 13. The Committee must remember that Clause 13 deals with power to make regulations and what such regulations may include. The Minister has got as close as makes no difference to saying that he will make regulations in pursuance of Clause 13(1,	<i>f</i>)—at least he went pretty far along those lines. The Clause contains a power to make regulations, and paragraph (	<i>f</i>) provides that the regulations may include what we are dealing with here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The central point is how are we to achieve the co-operation and the degree of consultation which everybody seems so anxious to achieve. We are coming down to positive detail. The general expressions of intention are there, but when we come to positive proposals to implement those, we are told that it might be very expensive and might slow up the whole planning process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My argument was that to adopt this Amendment and thus to exclude selectivity in any case would have these demerits. While I admit the burden of the hon. and learned Gentleman's argument in specific cases, he should be selective, and this is why I argue that Clause 13(1,	<i>f</i>) should remain as it is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are dealing here with the structure plan——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And local plans.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I said at the outset that I am concerned primarily with Amendment No. 6 which is to Clause 3. I said that I was not so concerned about the local plan because that is a smaller concept, and could be readily understood and appreciated by a visit to the office of the local planning authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A structure plan is essentially comprehensive, and, if we are seeking to honour the obligation to achieve consultation and co-operation at every stage the sooner the public get to know the full details the better. As the Minister has pointed out, not every member of the public is as interested as he should be in these matters, but we must cater for those members of the public who take the problem seriously, and who want
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0885">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>121</span>
the maximum facilities which can reasonably be provided. The Minister says that it will be going too far to provide a structure plan to the public at reasonable cost at this stage. After the report has been drawn up following on the survey, and after the structure plan has been drawn up following on the report, and both are sent to the Secretary of State for his consideration, then would be the appropriate moment for those interested members of the public who are prepared to pay a reasonable charge to be able to see both the report and the structure plan, but at least the structure plan which will be the subject of the Secretary of State's consideration. I appreciate that the Secretary of State may suggest amendments, there may be changes and ultimately a public inquiry, but my experience is that the sooner the interested member of the public is able to appreciate what is likely to be approved or involved, the better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that be right, and if we are anxious to take the public with us, it would be appropriate to provide by Statute, as has been done in other cases, for instance, in the Countryside Act, that copies should be available at reasonable price. I think, speaking from memory, that the Police (Scotland) Act contains a similar provision. I appreciate that we are dealing there with less expensive plans and proposals, but it is desirable that the public should be given the earliest possible and the most concrete information that is available when a structure plan has been submitted to the Secretary of State and the proposal has crystalised sufficiently far to enable an interested and appreciative member of the public to examine it. It may be altered by the Secretary of State later or as the result of a public inquiry.

Whatever may be said about the understandable tendency of planners to get their proposals through as quickly and efficiently as possible, we have in the Clause only general intentions and hopes. Nothing particularly concrete is contained in it. We should, therefore, clarify the position for the benefit of all concerned, including planning consultants and others, and despite any arguments about delay and expense that may arise, the Govern-
	<span class='label label-info column'>122</span>
ment should consider the Amendment closely before rejecting it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If a local authority is called on to publish a report, will the cost of publication be borne by the authority whose structure plan it is, or by the Scottish Office?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. J. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what I thought.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has a bearing on what I said earlier, that while it is legitimate for a local authority to be prepared at a certain stage to publish its formal proposals and make them available to all concerned, this question of cost must be borne in mind. A deficit is bound to arise. These will inevitably be expensive publications, and this deficit must fall on the local ratepayers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) argued that at every stage all the material should be available at a reasonable charge. I agree that we want public participation in planning to secure good and expeditious planning. Too often planning has become simply a tennis match between one lawyer and another at the expense of the public. I acquit the hon. and learned Gentleman of this, but there have been notable cases of planning inquiries going on almost 	<i>ad infinitum</i> with nothing being achieved and only the community suffering. I accept the need for public participation, but we must also have expeditious planning. I have seen enough examples during my time at the Scottish Office to know how an individual can, with the aid of clever lawyers, frustrate the desires of a community and greatly affect the lives and prosperity of many people. I deplore that. The law is designed to do the greatest good for the greatest number and, at the same time, to allow the individual a hearing, but without enabling him to exploit the great majority. While we want to see that the individual has the right to see structure and local plans before they go into the mechanism we propose, it would not be right to allow him to reverse what has been done, back to the formative stages before the matter went to the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not accept what the hon. and learned Gentleman said about the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0886">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>123</span>
Countryside (Scotland) Act, 1967, and certainly I will not speak about the Police Act in the presence of my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis). In the Countryside Act there is a requirement for inspection by the public at reasonable hours and without charge of copies of maps and other documents relating to the district. However, that refers to maps which have run the gamut of public discussion and which have been endorsed by the Secretary of State. A comparison between that Act and this Bill is irrelevant, and I trust that that disposes of the hon. and learned Gentleman's argument in this respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment is so comprehensive as to be cumbersome. It would not secure the spirit of what the hon. and learned Gentleman agrees with me should be enshrined in the Bill and accordingly I advise the Committee to reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The main burden of the Minister's earlier remarks related to the cost of providing copies of plans and supporting documents. He indicated in his later remarks that this cost might prove a burden on local ratepayers if these documents had to be provided at a reasonable cost. It would be helpful if the hon. Gentleman would indicate what he envisages will comprise these plans by way of documents and supporting details. This would help us to judge whether his argument about cost is legitimate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many instances planning consultants and others would be greatly assisted if these plans and documents could be studied in their offices rather than at the premises of planning authorities. Why does the hon. Gentleman imagine that the cost of making copies of these documents would be so high? Certainly the written parts of these plans could be stencilled. It might be more expensive to duplicate other types of plans and diagrams, but the Amendment specifically refers to the
	<br><blockquote><p>"reproduction of such diagrams and illustrations … as may be appropriate …"</p></blockquote>
A certain discretion would be left to local planning authorities in deciding what should be made available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lawson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although (the cost of providing these documents is important, my hon. Friend put his finger on the
	<span class='label label-info column'>124</span>
most obvious objection to the Amendment when he referred to interested parties seeking copies of these plans at every stage. The first stage might be a combination of local authorities working out their ideas, sketching maps and producing, not finished documents, but guidelines on how their ideas might be put into practice. Do hon. Gentlemen opposite expect preliminary details of this sort to be published officially by local authorities, with all the cost and work that that would involve?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When those ideas have been worked out, the matter will go to the Secretary of State, who must satisfy himself that the provisions mentioned earlier in the Clause have been complied with—that there has been sufficient publicity and so on—and then he will decide whether or not to approve them. If, before that stage, the preparatory work must be done in such a way that the material can be published officially, a considerable obstacle could be placed in the path of those who wish to carry out planning democratically and expediously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A body of people may, from the very beginning, have an objection to even a rough idea of a plan. It may be possible for an authority's ideas to be stymied from the start. People might arrange for their friends to demand not merely stencilled copies of documents but properly produced reports costing a great deal of money. Articulate people with power are able to organise hundreds of people into demanding all sorts of things; and they could demand these reports at the expense of the ratepayer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that somebody who objects to a plan and who wants to cause trouble will order hundreds of copies merely to make life difficult for the local authority?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just one would be enough.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that many people would demand copies and so hinder the procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lawson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member suggested that cheaply produced stencilled copies could be made available. That would suffice if only half a dozen people wanted them, but an officially produced

	<span class='label label-info column'>125</span>
report might be demanded and this could cause difficulties. Whenever property is threatened it is possible to get people worked up at an early stage—I referred to the stage before the details are sent to the Secretary of State—and difficulty could arise.

The hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Gordon Campbell) is ambitious.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way? I think that everybody knows that ambition is the one thing which I have never had. I have already had three different professions and nobody has ever accused me of that before.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lawson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the hon. Member should be ashamed of being ambitious.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is just not true.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lawson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was going to say something that might have pleased the hon. Member. He is the leading spokesman for the Opposition on Scottish affairs. His ambition might have led him towards the thought that some day he might be Secretary of State for Scotland——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And a very good one indeed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lawson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Heaven forbid that that should be so, though I have little doubt he has perhaps even more than a sneaking ambition that he might be the Secretary of State for Scotland. On that basis, he is seeking to make changes in legislation that could put him, with the very best intentions in the world, in an exceedingly difficult position to get sensible projects carried through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us imagine that that unfortunate thing has happened and the hon. Gentleman is the Secretary of State. I have a fair measure of trust in his honesty, even in matters of this kind, and I should have thought that he would have been prepared to let the plans and the report go to him in the first place, and, after he had looked at those and assured himself that the various provisions had been carried out adequately according to the regulations, it would then be permissible to publish the report and other docu-
	<span class='label label-info column'>126</span>
ments necessary for a reasonable judgment to be made as to how people were going to be affected by the plans and the report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that were not going to happen, and no powers had been taken to allow that to take place, or it were to happen at a stage where everything was cut and dried and the possibilities of proper objection were being denied, then I would take a different view. But that is not to happen. We understand that the clear intention in this Bill is that after the preliminary stages, when the plan is sufficiently mature, after it has been subjected to scrutiny, and there has been sufficient publicity of the intentions, and fairly advanced conclusions have been reached, it will be possible for anyone who wants to purchase those plans to dp so at a reasonable cost. I consider that that is as much as we could reasonably impose on local authorities, and it is a very considerable advance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the hon. and learned Member for Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) has on many occasions cried out against public spending and on the need to cut down public spending—perhaps this is a good thing, to make more and more work for his own profession—on this occasion he seeks to add unnecessarily to public spending and, what is more important, to make it so much more difficult for local authorities to carry on with their reasonable job of looking ahead, first putting ideas into a rough form, and then into a more detailed and final form, at which stage it is proper that these things should be seen clearly and judged and objected to if it is felt that those objections should be carried through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do hope that my hon. Friend will not accept this Amendment. Sensibly, the hon. and learned Gentleman opposite should withdraw it, without the necessity of having to put it to the vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have certainly no intention of withdrawing this Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee seems to be overlooking the fact that at the stage at which the structure plan is submitted to the Secretary of State it is deemed necessary to have a copy of that plan and all its associated documents available for inspection. Let us not forget that. That is something which the local authority
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0888">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>127</span>
has to do. The ideas have been crystallised to the extent to which a plan has been prepared, and under Clause 7, dealing with the preparation of local plans, it is provided that when the local planning authority has prepared a local plan it shall, before adopting it or submitting it for approval, make it available for inspection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thus in both cases we have reached a situation at which a plan has been prepared. We are not talking about providing plans at every stage; let us forget about that; we are not asking for that. I wish that hon. Members would understand that we are saying that when the plan has been prepared for submission to the Secretary of State copies should be made available, at a reasonable charge, to those members of the public who are interested because it will not be enough just to look at a structure plan in an office. In certain circumstances one has to be able to take a plan away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of what expense is involved is not a matter of importance. It is a side issue which the Minister of State keeps dragging in to bolster up an ineffective argument. A written statement which accompanies a development plan is only on a large scale what we already have in planning. It is a document which is run off—there is no special know-how about that and it is made available. It is cheap to produce. The plans are not cheap to produce, but they have to be produced. All we are asking for is that additional copies be made available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) has pointed out, we are not even expecting to take away all the diagrams and the whole of the plans. It may be perfectly adequate to have them scaled down. It is merely to enable access to those documents and plans. Not to people like myself, for it is certainly no part of an advocate's duty to go to the local planning authority and look up the plans. When I spoke about professional advisers, I was thinking of planning consultants who will be giving evidence on these matters. It is not sufficient simply to give them an opportunity to look at those in an office or at such other place as the Secretary of State may prescribe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>128</span>
At the stage of submission to the Secretary of State it is either necessary to let the public know what is going on, or not. The decision has been taken at that stage, and it is necessary to let the public know what is going on, because a plan is to be made available for inspection. If that is necessary, the whole object of the exercise could be defeated, particularly within the context of the structure plan, unless it is possible for interested parties to purchase a copy of that plan and take it away with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government do not accept an Amendment along those lines one really questions the 	<i>bona fides</i> of all the expressions of hope in Clause 3 at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Until now I thought—particularly from the intervention of the hon. Gentleman the Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith)—that hon. Members were seeking to find out what was meant by it all and what the cost was going to be. I was going to tell him that if he went to the Tayside Study Group and looked at the kind of things it was carrying out he would see the nature of the requirements imposed upon the local authorities by these Amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is no good trying to put Amendments of this kind, particularly one sponsored by a lawyer, who ought to know what are the implications of such Amendments. We cannot have woolly Amendments, defective in law, put into the Statute on the plea that the Government should redraft it. That is just not good enough. I am shouted at often enough in this Committee for not having a Law Officer sitting beside me, and how pleased the Opposition are, preening themselves that they have an ex-Law Officer sitting among them. If that is the position, then they ought to have legally effective Amendments. This is the woolliest Amendment we have seen for a long time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are simply acting against the public interest.

I am going to ask my hon. Friends to stand with me and defeat this charter of obstruction. Let us get on with the Bill so that we make it a good Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman not aware that expressions in almost exactly similar terms are to be found in one of his own Acts in recent years? Is he under the impression that I have drafted that Amendment without reference to somewhat similar provisions in earlier Statutes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The advice available to me, which, incidentally, is equal in capacity to that of the hon. and learned Gentleman, is that these are defective Amendments. They do not even cover what they seek to cover.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Tell us why. It is no use talking like that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have explained it all, patiently and calmly. The hon. Gentleman now rises to his feet and demands a vote on it and proceeds for the third time to make against this Clause an outburst which is wholly unjustified, questioning the Government's good faith time and time again. I can take it from him once, even—if he is in a bad mood—twice; but if he says it again it is a deliberate political manoeuvre on his part to misrepresent the Government's position on this Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am telling this Committee that the cost of this Amendment to the Government's purse and to the ratepayers would be substantial. It ought not to be ignored that the intention of some of the persons who would use these Amendments would be not to achieve public partici-
	<span class='label label-info column'>130</span>
pation but to defeat the attempt to produce a plan. They know it to be true from their own private experience elsewhere. The hon. and learned Gentleman has been in enough planning inquiries to know that a particular person, one of his irascible opponents, might be dedica ed to the proposition that no planning should ever be achieved. I would ask Scotsmen to look round at what is happening in Scotland today, and to ask themselves if there is not clear objection in definite areas already under the present planning procedure. What an absolute beanfeast it would be if we were to incorporate these Amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman is not asking the Minister to look at these Amendments and to produce one like them. He is insisting that they should go in, word for word. I am telling my hon. Friends from their experience that they really ought to stand with me against these Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. J. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of information, may I ask the Minister whether under this Clause there is anything to stop anybody from going to the appropriate office and taking copies, either by the use of a camera or by any other available means?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think my hon. Friend the Member for Motherwell (Mr. Lawson) in the first part of his speech well described the way the whole procedure would be carried out. I have tried in my own, perhaps inadequate, way to say the same thing as he, namely, if one looks forward to Clause 13(1)(	<i>f</i>), there is sufficient reference to what rights the Secretary of State has in this matter. If one looks back to the earlier subsections, the hon. Gentleman was kind enough in his own speech to point out that the Secretary of State can determine that adequate publicity has not been achieved by the authority and can return it to the authority. Therefore, the Secretary of State may, if he feels in any particular case that an individual or group of individuals have not had sufficient opportunity to obtain enough material, quite legitimately take it back to the local authority and ask that authority to make the material available to those people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other words, that is a selective approach, not a comprehensive, absolute

approach in every case, whether it is necessary or not. That is the point I am trying to stress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lawson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the point the hon. Gentleman raises, I do not know whether my hon. Friend has quite answered that. My understanding is—I would be corrected if I am wrong—that if someone went and looked at the document and plans and wanted to copy them there would be no objection to that, or to giving access to plans. There is no reason why my right hon. Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn) should not go along with a camera and take as many pictures as he wants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can confirm that. I hope that the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. James Davidson) is satisfied on this score. It is better to have this approach, which is openhanded and which does not lead to the position where it could be obstructive, which is, I more than suspect, the reason behind this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. A. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If anyone who wanted these plans were obstructed by a local authority, he would be entitled to appeal to the Secretary of State?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I confirm that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have never held myself out as a qualified Parliamentary draftsman, and would never seek to do so. I have always prefaced my Amendments by acknowledging that there may be defects in them. It has never been expected of an Opposition, who do not have the advantage of skilled Parliamentary draftsmen, that they should put forward Amendments which are either watertight or perfect word for word. I have never claimed that for this Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We try to follow the example of earlier provisions, and I have before me Section 26(2) of the Countryside Act, 1967. That provides that an authority where required
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall … have copies of the map and of the notices referred to … available for inspection by the public at such places as the authority may determine; and the authority shall display, at such places as they think fit, including places where the public obtain access to the land to which the map relates—reproductions of the map on an appropriate scale".</p></blockquote>
There is nothing sacroscant, unique or exceptional about the use of the expres-
	<span class='label label-info column'>132</span>
sion "reproductions on an appropriate scale".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is here proposed is that the reproductions should be made available on an appropriate scale. That does not mean on the same scale as the original map. It is running in my mind, and I will check it before we meet again in the hope that I will be able to bring it in sometime, that there is a similar provision in another piece of legislation. I am sure that I did not draft this altogether out of my head.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is all very well for the Minister to make allegations about people promoting their professional interests. I do not believe that any Member of the Committee takes that allegation seriously—I certainly do not. I do not think the hon. Gentleman really meant to attack me personally in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is all very well to criticise the drafting, but it is not right for the Government to reject the Amendment on drafting grounds alone. It is even worse when they refuse to tell us what is wrong with the drafting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is bloody awful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us ask ourselves; what are we seeking to do? The Clause provides that at a certain stage the plan is submitted to the Secretary of State and shall be available for inspection at the offices of the local authority. All that we are asking is that copies of the plan, including reproductions of such diagrams and illustrations on such a scale as may be appropriate, shall be made available for sale to the public, at a reasonable cost. It may be that there is a dispute about what is appropriate, but the whole procedure is governed by the wide discretion which the Secretary of State has about publicity. If it is not necessary to reproduce the map on the full scale, it can be reproduced on a smaller scale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we are seeking to do is quite clear, and what the Minister is really objecting to is the cost. Yet it is specifically provided that it is a cost which the public must bear, so there is not much in that argument. It will vary according to the size of the local planning authority, and the region covered by the structure plan. So far as can be seen, what is contemplated here, with units the size of Edinburgh and Glasgow in the first instance, will mean that this will be little more than the written statement which is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0891">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>133</span>
presently prepared and readily reproduced. I do not think that the Minister's objections are valid. In such a matter one does not go on hunches. I have discussed this proposal with people dealing with this, and I do not mean lawyers, people who have to work with this problem and act on behalf of a variety of clients to advise them. These people say that some such provision is necessary. All that we are left with is a general provision that the Secretary of State has power to deal with this problem, by regulation if he chooses, which, in my view, is not enough, The Amendment should be adhered to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see that the Minister has regained his composure. I am very glad that I do not have a doctor as my lawyer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) has boiled it down to the basic issue of cost. We are not trying to hide any information. The whole thing is whether the Minister feels that the local authority is justified in incurring expenditure to provide the plans. The hon. Gentleman will surely agree that most local authorities of any size have their own printing departments and that the difference between running off 50 copies or 200 copies, or even 500 copies, to sell at cost price will be insignificant. He is making a frightful mountain out of a molehill about the cost of the plans. The Amendment stands or falls on whether the cost is reasonable. We have made out a case that it will be reasonable, and the Minister has done absolutely nothing, in practical terms, to indicate what the average cost of the plans might be. I know that they will vary tremendously in size, but most of us have seen written development plans, and they are not enormous things. A local authority with its own printing presses or duplicating machines, could even produce the Clyde plan. Copies should be provided at a reasonable cost, which would be quite minimal. The Minister shakes his head. It will fall off if he goes on shaking it the way he has done today. I plead with him to be reasonable and practical. If members of the public want these plans they have a right to be able to purchase them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What puzzles me is that the Opposition keep stressing that they want
	<span class='label label-info column'>134</span>
plans at a reasonable cost. Normally, their propaganda is against subsidies of all kinds, against public expenditure. Surely what they are arguing for here is increased public expenditure, and subsidies for a selected number of people. If they are right in saying that this would be very cheap, why do they not say it should be produced at the economic or the real cost? Why say "reasonable"? Because if the "reasonable" cost is below the real cost, why not say the real cost? Who will want these documents? We are told that in the main it will be planning consultants. Is it being unfair to ask such people to pay the full cost? I cannot imagine the ordinary citizen wanting such documents and not being willing to pay for them, but I really do not think that many ordinary citizens will want them. If we had a local plan in Dundee which contained something of a special nature every planning consultant throughout Britain and perhaps the world might want it. I have no objection to providing them with copies, provided they pay the real cost. Why should they be subsidised? I know that this happens from my own experience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 7, in page 5, line 7. leave out "proceed to".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This should be a short debate on a simple matter of drafting, unless the Government are really more obstinate than we even think. I suggest that the words which we propose to leave out are unnecessary, but in order to make the position clear to the Committee I would ask the Minister to tell us what difference the words "proceed to" make to the sentence? This part of the Clause speaks of the Secretary of State, and it says
	<br><blockquote><p>"he shall proceed to consider whether to approve the structure plan",</p></blockquote>
Can the Minister tell us whether there is any difference if the words "proceed to" are omitted, and if so, what the difference is?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will concede this, that strictly speaking the words which are proposed to be deleted are not needed, but I think there is some sense in having these words in the Clause because we are at a definitive stage in the process of public consultation. The Clause is drafted in terms which have been deliberately chosen to establish that consideration about participation is an</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>136</span>
	<p>in this sensible manner. They want to alter it in a nonsensical way. If that is what they are really putting their weight to—all five hon. Gentlemen opposite—then I cannot agree with them. The provision in the Bill is wise, sensible, and framed in a manner which will help local authorities to exercise that measure of economy and care over local expenditure of which I would have thought hon. Gentlemen would approve.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the Amendment be made:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 5, Noes, 11.</p>
	<p>essential preliminary to the plan itself. The words "proceed to consider" are meant to indicate as emphatically as possible that there is a complete separation between the consideration of the participation exercise and the consideration of the plan. So while in law they might be considered unnecessary, in terms of defining the distinction between one phase and another, they are useful. With this short explanation I hope the hon. Gentleman will agree that it is right to make a distinction between one phase and another.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I propose to withdraw this Amendment I am tempted to use some words which the hon. Gentleman used just now. This seems to me to be one of the "woolliest" bits of drafting I have seen for some time. I will not press this Amendment if he says that these words are necessary. Clearly, this is a drafting matter, but if the Committee will look again at the sentence it really does seem to be a woolly piece of drafting and one would have hoped for more clarity. This makes it look as though a long time can be spent before even getting round to consider whether to approve or not. However, in view of the Minister's reply, odd though it is, I will withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman does that I would like to explain about the "woolliness". Commons Members, on both sides in the English Committee, in the absence of these "woolly" words, asked the Government to put them in, and when the Government put in these "woolly" words to help that Bill to distinguish clearly between the two phases, the English Committee, and in particular the English Conservative Opposition, welcomed it warmly. I am sorry there is a split in the Conservative Party over these words——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is nothing like the split in the Labour Party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought it was a useful suggestion, and I, for one, am not such a narrow-minded Scotsman as to believe that if the English have something in another piece of legislation we ought not to repeat it in ours. We often say that in reverse to our English friends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the Minister has intervened before I withdraw what was indeed a drafting Amendment, because he has confirmed what we said at Second Reading, and have been saying ever since, namely, that the Government have slavishly followed every single word in the English Bill. We shall raise this again later when we reach important points and there really is an entirely different situation in Scotland and the Government have followed word for word what appears in the English Bill. I am sorry that the Government should feel they have got to follow the English text on all these points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a very good point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has revealed what we expected, and, as he has admitted himself, we recognised that these words were not needed. I am glad to give way to the right hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a conciliatory note, I think perhaps the hon. Gentleman would be only too glad to save the excessive Government expenditure which would be caused in deleting these words.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think there would be any Government expenditure involved at all in deleting two words, but I will not pursue the matter further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>138</span>
The Minister has revealed a most interesting fact, namely, that every single——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Dot and comma.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—dot and comma in the English Bill, including a small drafting point such as this, has been included in the Scottish Bill. We are sorry that this should have happened, in planning legislation in particular, and when we come to the appeals side we shall refer to this again. After such revealing information by the Minister I will not press the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 106, in page 5, line 29, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>(8) The Secretary of State may prescribe by regulation for the implementation of paragraphs (	<i>a</i>) to (c) of subsection (1) above.</p></blockquote>
This Amendment is not strictly necessary because the provisions with regard to the general powers are contained in Clause 13, but it is not a case of having put down an Amendment to Clause 3 before I had reached consideration of Clause 13. Sometimes it is desirable to have in one Clause, and especially if it is an important Clause, matters which may not be strictly necessary but which at least focus all the important considerations in the one clause, and I would respectfully suggest that it would not be inappropriate to draw attention to the fact that in this Clause, which, on the face of it, gives a wide discretion to local authorities, regulations affecting the exercise of that discretion may be enacted by the Secretary of State. Although I concede that this Amendment may not be necessary, looking at it from the point of view of the lay member of the public reading this Clause, it would not be a bad thing to draw his attention to the fact that there may be regulations affecting this as well as what is actually contained in the Clause itself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that this Amendment is unnecessary. The question is, does it add emphasis? Which is, indeed, the reason why we argued in another Committee. I agree that in terms of drafting it would be bad to bespatter Clause 3 with a series of references to regulations, but I wonder
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0894">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>139</span>
whether the hon. and learned Gentleman is wise in suggesting that there should be this one reference. I accept that obviously he has read the Bill quite thoroughly, and he put down this Amendment in the knowledge that it is included in Clause 13. This is a small point of difference between us. I do not think it adds emphasis. I think that, if anything, it would slightly confuse people as to why we had made this reference here and then gathered everything together in Clause 13. In my view it is better to leave it to Clause 13, which gives a complete and comprehensive picture of the regulation-making powers of the Secretary of State in relation to development plans, and it would be better to turn to that Clause for the entire references. Accordingly I would ask the hon. and learned Gentleman, on a peaceful note, if he would not agree that this Amendment ought not to be made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to respond to the suggestion that we should resume diplomatic relations, and in the light of what the hon. Gentleman has said, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now seem to have reached rather more placid waters after a stormy time in the middle, and let us hope that this rather more conciliatory attitude on the part of the Minister of State may continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is stirring it up again now!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that in all the Amendments we have discussed so far, we have been trying to improve the Bill. As the Minister of State has said, this Clause is absolutely fundamental to one of the main aims of the Bill, and, as we have constantly repeated, the purpose of trying to give better participation between the people and those responsible for planning. What I ask the Minister is that in the regulations which are to be made and which will govern the way in which the local authorities carry out their obligations under this Clause, everything possible shall be done to make sure that the public are
	<span class='label label-info column'>140</span>
made aware of what is happening in these structure plans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is important, for one practical reason. In cases like this I have found so often that if an organisation comes in at a later stage and it has not objected at an earlier stage, that organisation is then told that it is too late and it is fobbed off and brushed aside. For that reason the whole question of publicity at the earliest stage of the preparation and the publication of the structure plan is most important. I hope that when the Clause is put into effect, and structure plans are publicised, this is born in mind, so that the public have the earliest possible opportunity in the planning procedure to make their point and not have to leave it to a later stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second question I would like to ask the Minister is on the time which will be available for the public to look at the planning proposals. It is difficult to be definite about this, and I do not ask him to be so, as it will depend on the complexity of the plan, but will the Minister give an assurance that, whether the plan is complex or straightforward, adequate time is available to the public to consider the plan? I do not relate this solely to members of the public but also to consultants, so that they have time to see the plan and to discuss it with their clients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come back to what I said at the beginning. We are asking for participation by the public in planning proposals, and we want an assurance that, without lengthening the procedure too much, ample time is given for adequate consideration of the plans. This is an important Clause, which is fundamental to the Bill, and I hope that we can have assurances on these points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lawson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to emphasise the publicising of plans from a slightly different angle from that of the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith). Much of the publicity which is given to plans is publicity of objections. There is often a minority of people who may be fairly well off and well advised who utilise the facilities available to build up their objections to the plan, although the plan may contain excellent features which are never brought out. I would like an assurance that publicity will be given not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0895">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>141</span>
only in affording facilities for the minority to object, but for the description of what might be the excellent features of the plan, so that the public can be involved in supporting the plan. So often the public are not aware of the good features, and learn only of what some people choose to describe as bad features. I hope that in publicising plans the good features will be emphasised and that these are not left to be tackled in a defensive way in dealing with objections. A good piece of advise for a boy taking up boxing is that attack is the best method of defence, and this advice should apply here. Very often the local authorities and those concerned with planning are placed in the position of having to defend their plans, whereas they should go into the attack, to show how valuable those plans will be for the community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although such plans are supposed to take into account transport problems, I feel that insufficient consideration is given to transport. Where within a structure plan there is set out an industrial area with no houses, and a separate residential area consisting entirely of houses with no industry, a traffic problem is created. Would a possible ground for objection to the structure plan be on this basis, that such a plan would compel people, whether they like it or not, to travel substantial distances, thus creating traffic problems such as are suffered by every large conurbation? Would that be a valid objection to a structure plan?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer to the question put by my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Doig) is, Yes, it would be a valid objection, and one which should be pressed till a proper explanation is given or a proper modification made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I disagree with nothing said by the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith). I accept his first point about public participation. This is a line which we should pursue. This is what the Government are trying to do in accepting the report of the Planning Advisory Group. It is what we tried to do at the conference in January, 1967, and what we have tried to assert, despite the assertions to the contrary, in all our arguments on the Clause. We
	<span class='label label-info column'>142</span>
genuinely wish to secure at every stage public participation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On his second point we wish to see, in the words of my hon. Friend the Member for Motherwell (Mr. Lawson), democratic and expeditious participation in planning. Within the qualifications mentioned by the hon. Gentleman in the second part of his speech, I accept that what he said is perfectly valid and I can give him the assurance for which he asks. In reply to the final point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Motherwell in his excellent speech, which should be read by planning conveners, if not provosts and county convenors, the good points of a plan are often forgotten in the welter of objections from interested parties and others who, as they see it, are acting on behalf of the public. There is a great burden of responsibility for this on elected members of local authorities, not officials, who in advance of the plan go to the Secretary of State seeking to argue its merits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will take it a stage further. The Metra report is most interesting to read. 	<i>The Glasgow Herald</i> and, indeed, the 	<i>Greenock Telegraph,</i> neither of them a supporter of the Labour Party so far as I am aware, have done excellently in a series of articles in emphasising the good side of the Metra report. We know that the Corporation is an objector at the inquiry into one of the proposals which started last week and I will not comment on that. My local authority is considering being an objector. It is interesting to see that these two great daily newspapers in the Clyde Valley have taken on the role of championing the positive aspects of the Metra report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Were I a young man involved in planning as a planning convener or in some other position of authority, I would make it my job to highlight the positive aspects of any plan which I was putting forward, while taking into account the objections being made, and I endorse absolutely what my hon. Friend has said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been an interesting and somewhat stormy morning, but we have now arrived at a state of amity, with diplomatic relations fully restored, and have been able to get on at a faster rate than hitherto.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has told us that there must be publicity, and that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0896">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>143</span>
persons who wish to make representations should be given the opportunity to do so. How does the Minister envisage that this will work? When the local planning authority has had its survey, and the report and the structure plan are produced, how does the Minister envisage that the public will be involved at this stage? Does he envisage that the report of the survey will be drawn to the attention of the public and that, while the local planning authority is preparing the structure plan, occasional public meetings will be held to explain what is being done?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could not agree more with what was said about the positive side of planning proposals. It is right and proper that the advantages of planning proposals should be brought home. On the other hand, it should not be assumed that objections are necessarily made by self-centred and self-interested parties, and that they are, therefore, less well founded than the proposals. Even the most conscientious planning authorities may make awful mistakes, and the system of the public inquiry is a good one, although it involves expense and takes up time. While recognising the merits of positive planning proposals, we must not approach the type of co-operation which we are looking for on the basis that anyone who objects is suspect and that objections are not well founded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the quality of the speeches on the Question, That the Clause stand part of the Bill, are in inverse proportion to the number of Conservatives present. The speeches have been of high
	<span class='label label-info column'>144</span>
quality, and I congratulate the Opposition, the two hon. Gentlemen on the Front Bench, with nobody behind them, on their accomplished contributions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not disagree with a word of what was said by the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie). I agree that the description given by him of the way this could be done is not unreasonable. Both he and I, and others interested in this matter, will be able to talk much more appreciatively on this once the Skeffington Committee has reported. The Committee will not limit itself to regulations under the Bill but will deal also with guidance which would not be put into regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come back to the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Motherwell (Mr. Lawson). We depend upon the personalities of elected members of local planning authorities to be able to put over the merits of a plan, at the same time giving consideration to those with fair-minded and reasonable objections.
