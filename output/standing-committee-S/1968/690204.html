<p><i>Amendment proposed</i> [<i>30th January</i>], in page 1, line 19, leave out "ability and aptitude".—[<i>Mr. Wright.</i>]</p>
<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcolm MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The case for the Amendment has been argued along peculiar lines by hon. Members opposite. They have expressed horror at the thought of any dilution of the comprehensive system at the same time as they have blessed it in principle. They want to "leave it there", to use the well-worn phrase. Even accepting the argument that these words appear to create some degree of selectivity within the system, the hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Wright) would surely not seriously quarrel with a degree of selectivity, since, of course, there is a continuous process of assessment of ability and aptitude in any system of education, and within the comprehensive system one must accept that there must also be such assessment on a continuous basis.<br><br>
Comprehensive education has been described as a single integrated process and, of course, it is. We visualise the system as the promotion of a steady flow of education from the earliest years, through the middle years, right through the last two years of school to the age of 16 and, presumably, beyond that. Having regard to ability and aptitude in such a process is surely no contradiction or interruption.<br><br>
There has been an interesting correspondence in the <i>Glasgow Herald</i> about fee-paying schools. The Headmaster of St. Augustine's Secondary School in Glasgow wrote of trying to achieve teaching of a subject at the pace relative to the child's ability at the time. He does not mean any fixed time, with an eye to an arbitrary
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 54</span>
thing like the 11-plus. Surely the comprehensive system, like any other system of education, must have careful regard to the child's developing capacity and apitude.<br><br>
To argue against the comprehensive system on the grounds that, in practice, such assessment might be a contradiction within it, is to argue against what, I believe, must be the hon. Member's own true beliefs. I cannot imagine that he would rule out any regard being had to the ability or aptitude of the child throughout its education. I see no contradiction in this requirement in the Bill. I would like him to elaborate his real reasons, if there are any, for the Amendment, because the words "ability and aptitude" are only ostensibly a contradiction within the comprehensive system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Esmond Wright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will try to reduce some of the problems to perspective. We have heard phrases like "in principle" and "leave it here"—not least from the hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan). This is a probing Amendment. The hon. Gentleman is quite right. We would not wish to pretend that in any system of education on could omit ability and aptitude. We are seeking by this probing Amendment to get at what is part of the core of the problem in comprehensive education. The hon. Member said that one "visualises" the comprehensive system. We are all visualising it. We are not sure, in practise, as yet, what it means.<br><br>
There are essentially three problems when we talk of age, ability and aptitude in terms of comprehensive education. First, if we have a comprehensive system determined on high in this place, the characteristics of local control are threatened in their very being. I do not want to probe this aspect far because I would be ruled out of order if I got on to the subject of fee-paying schools, but one of the factors concerning us is that fee-paying schools in Glasgow and Edinburgh surely have features which could genuinely be called comprehensive, and they have inherent features characteristic of the areas in which they are situated. We do not know the exact size and shape of the comprenhensive system. That applies to all of us. This is not a party divide but a person to person divide. I suggest that we have a system
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0481">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 55</span>
of comprehensive education, which there has been right through Scottish history, and it is not related to the arguments on comprehensive education which now take place. So, what we mean by it in terms of a threat to local control?<br><br>
The second point arises from the question of where the Conservative Party stands on the issue of comprehension and selectivity. It is difficult to give a short answer. First, we believe that the present system is remarkably comprehensive both in terms of subjects set and in ranges of schools and of backgrounds from which the pupils come. The degree of social mix in Scottish education is better than what obtains in many of the star comprehensive schools in England.<br><br>
What worries me is this: are we saying that we have the resources to provide the very large comprehensive schools needed if comprehensive education is to live up to its ideals, assuming that we all share them? We have to have very large schools in which there has to be a big degree of mixture of children, not only on the playing fields and in hobbies but in the classrooms. As has been said, if we are going to build big new comprehensives, especially in the main cities, they are bound to be located in suburbs, and they would worsen rather than bridge the social divide. In this sense, I am worried about talk of comprehensive education as though by waving a wand we could solve social problems.<br><br>
When asked whether we are in favour of comprehensive education, I reply, "Of course. But in what size of school and with what facilities?" We are trying to measure these things against reality. Basically, I believe that all new schools built ought to be comprehensive by definition, but I do not think this is any answer to the problem which is still creeping up in terms of the somewhat distant future.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary of State asked how far this can be reconciled with selectivity and he suggested that this was the centre of our argument. I believe that this is at the centre of all discussion of education. How do we select with justice and fairness? How do we give opportunity for later transfer according
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 56</span>
to changing ability and aptitude? This is important. One can only do it in very big schools. It would not be pertinent to talk now of administrative problems—the sense of remoteness and anonimity which is apt to creep in. This is not a specific answer, but there is none.<br><br>
There has to be some facility for transfer. There is inevitably a fairly constant process of selection at intervals. "Selectivity" is a loaded word, but it comes up because it is essential to the education process. If we can be told how we can reconcile "comprehensive" and "selection", I shall be grateful. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin), whose absence we deplore, gave a brilliant description, if in rather old-fashioned terms, of the characteristics of the old-fashioned education system as he saw it. We are, perhaps, assuming here that everyone is inherently and even perhaps intellectually the equal of everyone else. The facts disprove it. Therefore, the important feature in any system is the method whereby one selects. One owes as much to one's gifted pupils as to the less gifted pupils, and there is a danger in comprehensivisation as it works out of reducing everyone to a common norm, and I am opposed to that. Later, we shall consider the problem of the mentally handicapped but it is as important to pay attention to the mentally gifted as it is to the mentally backward.<br><br>
Research would confirm, I am sure, that the comprehensive principle is not yet producing a genuine collaboration in terms of equality between different pupils. They stick with their own friends from their own background. I wonder whether the ideals of the system are working out in reality. These are some of the reasons behind the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alex Eadie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to speak, but in view of some statements made by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Wright) there are a number of points I want clarified. I hope that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State will assist in this process. We must certainly carry on the debate a little further in view of some of the hon. Member's challenging statements.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 57</span>
10.45 a.m.<br><br>
I was slightly surprised when the hon. Member tried to give two definitions of education. He is surely aware that there are three and not two aspects of education, when we talk of placing a child in its proper educational setting. I would have thought that the hon. Gentleman would have introduced a third one, which is character—character, ability and aptitude. This is not my own point, because it is generally accepted by most educationists, and the hon. Gentleman's confusion and failure to understand the comprehensive system is probably due to his recent conversion to the principle. In fact, he hinted at that when he said, "We accept it in principle".<br><br>
The hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) bore out the point when he showed a lukewarm approach in connection with his own constituency. The hon. Gentleman is aware that I contested his constituency in 1959 and 1964. At that time, one of the burning issues was education, and I am sure that his statement will be looked at with interest in his constituency.<br><br>
The word "selectivity" has been bandied about a good deal. However, I want to come back to the point made by the hon. Member for Pollok. We do not generally hear this sort of argument about selectivity when we discuss comprehensive education. The more usual term is "setting" and, contrary to the hon. Gentleman's view, one of the advantages of comprehensive schools is their size. In a large comprehensive school it is possible to have a bigger variety of courses which, in term, widen the educational opportunities. I have heard it described as the aristocracy of achievement arising from the democracy of opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian MacArthur</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Very well put,</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eadie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: All children are not equal, but it is important to give equal opportunity according to their character, ability and aptitude.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eadie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is the argument for larger school populations. I have had the experience of going into a large comprehensive school and seeing a boy seriously disabled who has no educational aptitude or ability for many of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 58</span>
subjects but who has an aptitude for art. As a consequence of being in a large comprehensive school and not being written off as an educational failure, he is able to pursue art to a very high standard.<br><br>
This is not a matter of saying that the individual will reach any high academic achievement. This does something for the well being of children. A comprehensive school gives them opportunity for a certain dignity of achievement which they would never achieve under the system we had before comprehensive education.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Younger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has been discussing the advantages of large comprehensive schools. Can he give us his views on the disadvantages, if any, of very small comprehensive schools where there will be only a small number of children with high ability?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eadie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman must define what he means by a small comprehensive school. In my opinion, the ideal size for a comprehen sive school is about 800, or even 1,200 or 1,300. Such a school is very much superior to one with a larger population. Anything smaller imposes a limitation on the number of courses. The hon. Gentleman's argument is that a big school results in remoteness and the teachers not knowing anything about their pupils. That problem is tackled successfully in places like Eton and Harrow, which are about the biggest comprehensive schools in the country, by dividing them up into houses.<br><br>
In my experience, a big comprehensive school means that it is possible to bring in a bigger variety of courses and, in addition, provide many other facilities which would not be described as purely academic. That sort of thing is possible with suitable size and numbers. I know that that is not accepted generally, but that has been my experience.<br><br>
I have always argued that the comprehensive system is a vast improvement on the old junior secondary and high school system. I am surprised that doubts are being expressed about it by hon. Members. How can anyone defend the junior secondary system? How can anyone defend a system of education which decides that 65 per cent. of the school
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0483">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 59</span>
population should be written off as failures? That is what it meant. It was monstrously unfair to the children, and disastrous to a small country like ours which cannot afford to waste talent. It is criminal to separate children according to their I.Q.s. It was even worse to predetermine at a child's educational future 12-plus.<br><br>
I intervened in the debate because of the statement made by the hon. Member for Pollok. I want to take issue with him on his point about selectivity. He defined it as ability and aptitude. I prefer, as do most educationists in Scotland, character, ability and aptitude. I do not want to be accused of misinterpreting the hon. Gentleman's intentions, and I hope that he will have a chance to explain and clarify his point. I want to draw his attention to something that he said on Thursday, because I gained the impression that in his mind there was a nostalgic longing for the I.Q. test. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I take the argument further. How will he judge ability and aptitude along comprehensive lines?"</p></blockquote>
Then came what I thought was the most menacing statement of all:
<br><blockquote><p>"Will he leave it entirely to the erratic verdicts of individual schools, headmasters' reports, teachers' reports, and so on?"—[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 30th January, 1969; c. 37.]</p></blockquote>
To some extent, that is a very unfair criticism of our teaching staffs. There is nothing erratic within our comprehensive system, where teachers can decide in setting talents, ability, character and aptitude of individual pupils. It would appear that the hon. Gentleman does not place much faith in the competence of the teaching profession to assist in placing children into the system. Does he believe in the Kingsley Amis philosophy that more shall be worse? He should tell the Committee, because it is important from the point of view of comprehensive education.<br><br>
I have seen the limited pool of ability resulting from the operation of the I.Q. theory, for which I allege that the hon. Gentleman and some of his hon. Friends seem to have nostalgic longings. I remember going into a comprehensive school and carrying out an experiment. The children had been submitted for O level examinations, and the results had
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 60</span>
just been published. I said to the headmaster, "I know that you have had more success in terms of passes than any other school in the area. Without mentioning any names, would you tell me their I.Q.s?" The I.Q. theory was demolished. I discovered that children with I.Q.s of 98 and 99 had taken two O level passes. Children with I.Q.s of 107, 108 and 109 were also getting two O levels. There was even the distinction whereby children with I.Q.s of 100 were getting three and four O levels and children with I.Q.s of 109 having to struggle to obtain two O levels. If it is suggested that ability should be gauged on the basis of I.Q. we are coming dangerously near the old system. Some of the children I am discussing would have been among the 65 per cent. who went to the junior secondary schools, which would have been monstrously unfair.<br><br>
It is not a matter of doing children a favour. I have never denied the fact that if a child has O levels he has the chance to get a better job. It is one of the facts of life, though, in my view, it is wrong to some extent. Having a better education means something, and it is even more important in this modern scientific and technological world than it was in the past.<br><br>
The case for comprehensive education has been made on the basis of academic success. That should appeal to the hon. Member for Pollok. I would have liked to have dealt with the social effects, but they have not been argued so much. However, the case has been made adequately for the comprehensive system. It is often said that we still know very little about education, despite the great advances which have been made. After many years of experience in education I believe it to be true. I have never argued that we have devised the perfect system, but the fact remains that comprehensive education is vastly superior to the previous system, because it gives all children the chance of an education according to their character, ability and aptitude.</span></p>
<p>11.0 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Bruce Millan)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We had a discussion last week on the Amendment and we have carried it over for a fair length of time this morning. I doubt whether we need to carry the discussion further
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0484">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 61</span>
since the hon. Member for Glasgow, Polok (Mr. Wright) has now said that this is simply a probing Amendment. That was not in the least clear from what he said last Thursday, nor is it yet clear to me, despite what he has said this morning, exactly what are his views on the selective system in the terms in which I described and defined it last week, as compared with the comprehensive system. I doubt whether any probing from me, certainly on the experience of last week and today, will enable us to elucidate exactly what the hon. Gentleman believes, but perhaps that may become a little clearer as we go through the Bill.<br><br>
As I pointed out last week, what we are arguing about on selection is the simple proposition whether or not it is right and desirable to have a process of selection at a particular age, namely the age of 12, which virtually determined for all time the kind of education which children should obtain from that time onwards until they left school. I said then, and I say it again to emphasise the point, that in my view such a system of selection does not meet the realities of the educational situation, and does not do justice to large numbers of children.<br><br>
We require a system which enables us to identify abilities and aptitudes as they develop and manifest themselves, whenever that development and manifestation may be, and also a system which enables us to deal with individual pupils, not as bundles of aptitude at a certain level all the way through the individual subjects of the curriculum, but as individual pupils who are apt and able at some subjects but less apt and less able at others. The old selective system does not enable one to do that. It involves the selection and division at a particular age, based on what can only be an inadequate, and, however we try to revise it ultimately, an inaccurate assessment of general ability at a particular time.<br><br>
Having decided to eliminate that kind of selective system, we have by no means solved the problems of how to organise the comprehensive school, either in terms of the general curriculum, or in terms of how one divides up the pupils and the range of courses provided, and in how to fit these courses of individual subjects to the aptitudes and abilities of individual pupils. But, of course, it has never been claimed, by even the most
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 62</span>
fervent advocate of the comprehensive system, that the abolition of selection at the age of 12 automatically solves all these problems.<br><br>
That simple proposition was all that I was saying last week. To put that simple proposition is not to confess failure. It is simply to state what we must all accept, that the problem is to ensure that each individual pupil is enabled to demonstrate his ability and to get the kind of education which fits his abilities and aptitudes. That is, under any system, an extremely difficult problem, but a problem which we think—and I have heard nothing this morning to suggest otherwise—is much more susceptible of solution in a comprehensive system than in a selective system with that almost irreversible decision at the age of 12. That is what the argument is about, and I need say little more about it this morning.<br><br>
Problems of the size of schools, and so on, are very interesting, and no doubt we shall argue about them at length on another occasion, but I think we are all agreed that this Amendment is an unnecessary and false Amendment and should, therefore, be rejected.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister at any rate for the latter part of what he said, which I find impeccable. It is absolutely true to say that we do not know how the comprehensive system will work out in terms of organisation. In moving the Amendment I was seeking to establish that there is a danger of conflict between the implications of the comprehensive system and the implications of judging ability and aptitude.<br><br>
I do not want to follow the hon. Member for Midlothian (Mr. Eadie) in his suggestion that it ought to be age, character, ability and aptitude. I noticed that he was not bold enough to put it down as an Amendment. I doubt if any teacher or any body of men and women would want to judge children according to their character or character development for the purpose of assessing their suitability for schools. I can see many consequences that would follow from this which would all be savagely dangerous to society. It is arguable that it should be done to adults, but not to children. I do not think the hon. Member was very serious in making this proposal.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0485">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 63</span>
On the point about judging ability and aptitude on comprehensive lines, and whether that should be left to headmasters' and teachers' reports and so on, if one departs from a choice at the age of 12—and we are all wary about branding people permanently at the age of 12. which of course is wrong—and replaces it by a series of reports from hosts of thousands or tens of thousands of teachers upon tens of thousands of children, in the end a difficult process of judgment has to be made, and I am suggesting that that system would not provide quite the same degree of objectivity.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. M. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What does that mean—that last sentence about hosts of thousands of judgment to be made—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member must not interrupt in a recumbent position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. Jennings, but while the hon. Gentleman was standing I had to remain seated. I beg his pardon. What did he mean by his last sentence?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Assuming that we replace the system of selective tests at the age of 12, and assuming that we are talking of a big, impeccable comprehensive school in which every variety of subject is taught by every variety of teacher, how will the groups of pupils then be found—for example, the backward child in every subject but art? There would have to be a system of reports.<br><br>
There would first be a major problem of bureaucracy, with the headmaster spending his whole time considering the merits of the pupils, and this is one of the risks in the big comprehensive schools in the south of England. There could creep into the system a degree of erratic verdict: who will make the reports; do they all mean the same thing? This is normal in all teaching establishments right through educational history. There is a danger here that a whole series of personal judgments could creep in, compared with the occasionally wrong test at 12.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely the hon. Gentleman agrees that one of the most satisfactory factors of the 11-plus situa-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 64</span>
tion is that there is a teacher's assessment and a marginal allowance by the teacher who has had experience of the child? Why should the hon. Gentleman find it objectionable for this to be carried on in another form at a later stage?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In all this argument the two ideas, if there are two sides, become sharply polarised. I end up as if I were defending a system of choice, of streaming and ruthlessness and, on the other side, there seems to be a danger of comprehensive meaning no sharp judgment at all. I believe that in this system at the age of 11 in England and 12 in Scotland there has to be a marriage of some form of test—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Hannan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman represents a Glasgow constituency, but has he visited any of the comprehensive schools in the city to learn about them at firsthand? I would invite him to go to Knightswood Secondary School and learn from the headmaster about their successful practices. Is the hon. Gentleman confessing that he has not yet visited a comprehensive school to see how it works in practice?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am seeking to establish what I said in one of my recent speeches about the trend in comprehensive education. This was the burden of my remarks. I believe, and the point of this comes sharply home when we reach the fee-paying schools in our big cities, that the trend is to theaten the process of sharp judgment in testing, and there is a serious danger of forgetting the significance of character training which there is in work for an examination at whatever age. I will not press this point since it would take us a long way from the Amendment; there is much here to which we shall be returning; but, as the Minister says, I think we have given enough attention to this, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Object.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I was about to ask the pleasure of the Committee, whether the hon. Member be given permission to withdraw the Amendment. If another hon. Member gets to his feet to speak I cannot then put that to the Committee, and it means that we have to dispose of the Amendment in other ways.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has pursued what he began by saying was a probing Amendment, but it is obviously an Amendment which is fundamental to his party's way of thinking on the Bill. I think he should face a Division on it and not, as he said to my hon. Friend in another respect, simply run away and not have the courage to pursue it to a vote.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Younger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely the hon. Gentleman is perfectly well aware of the normal convention in this Committee, which is used time and time again, that numerous hon. Members, on both sides of the Committee, put down Amendments in order to get information out of the Government, with sometimes no intention of pressing them. Surely the hon. Gentleman is aware of this practice and can detect it when he sees it?</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 4, in page 2, line 11, leave out 'social'.<br><br>
It may save much unnecessary debate later on if I explain slowly and clearly to the hon. Gentleman for the Western Isles (Mr. MacMillan) that this is a probing Amendment. Its purpose is to discover from the Government what they have in mind, and I hope that the answer we get will be a good deal clearer than the answer we had to our last probing Amendment.<br><br>
We could equally well have moved to leave out the word "cultural" because the remarks which I shall address to this Amendment could equally well apply to the word "cultural", and I am sure the hon. Gentleman will appreciate this. For the final removal of any doubt, it is my hope that the word "social" will remain in the Clause, but before we leave this part of the Clause I think it is important that we should question the Minister about what he has in mind in this Clause and what purpose is represented by the use of this word.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has said that he wishes the word to remain in the Clause. Now he asks what it means. Is it not rather strange for him to wish for a word to remain in the Clause when he does not know what it means?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 66</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am certain that the right hon. Gentleman has some concept of the meaning of the word "social", as I have. In the context in which it appears it begs certain questions which need an answer, and I hope the right hon. Gentleman will agree that that is so, if he will be good enough to allow me to develop my argument further.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Maclennan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. Mr. Jennings, the hon. Member has referred to the conventions of this Committee about probing Amendments, but I would like to seek your advice about this. My understanding of the purpose of a probing Amendment is that it is to obtain a reply from the Minister, which, if it is found satisfactory to the Opposition, will lead to the withdrawal of the Amendment; but if, on the contrary, it is not thought to be satisfactory, the Amendment will be pressed. The hon. Gentleman has indicated that, whatever happens, the Opposition intend to withdraw the Amendment. In these circumstances, I suggest that the debate is superogatory and should be terminated forthwith.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</span> <i>rose</i>—</p>
<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. A point of order is raised and I must answer it. It is not really a valid point of order. There are certain conventions and procedures—I might even call them tricks of the trade—and this is one of them. These tricks of the trade are practised by both sides of the Committee and the House. This is perfectly in order. If anybody gets out of order I shall very soon tell him so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am shocked and disappointed that the hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Mr. Maclennan) should take this approach to what is a reasonable Amendment courteously put forward before the Committee and so far, I think, courteously moved by me. The hon. Gentleman's argument is that the Minister should be able to answer a question before the question is put.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Do not let us digress on what is or what is not in order. I have given a Ruling. Let us get on with the debate.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 67</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely, Mr. Jennings. I am obliged.<br><br>
The word "social" appears alongside the words "cultural and recreative activities" which the local education authorities are required to provide under Clause 1. We wish to discover what these social, cultural and, indeed, recreative activities are to be.<br><br>
Section 6 of the 1962 Act, which continues in force, provides a clear link with what will be Section 1 of the 1969 Act when the Bill goes through. Section 6 of the 1962 Act gives some explanation of what were then described as
<br><blockquote><p>"recreation and social and physical training"</p></blockquote>
facilities.<br><br>
Section 6 reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"For the purpose of securing adequate facilities for recreational and social and physical training, an educational authority may establish, maintain and manage, or assist the establishment, maintenance and management of, camps, holiday classes, playing fields, play centres and other places (including playgrounds, gymnasiums and swimming baths not appropriated to any school or educational establishment) at which facilities for recreation and for such training as aforesaid are available for persons receiving primary, secondary or further education. They may also organise games, expeditions and other activities for such persons, and may defray or contribute towards the expenses thereof".</p></blockquote>
Subsection (2) provides that an education authority may co-operate with voluntary bodies which provide similar facilities.<br><br>
It appears that the facilities envisaged by the 1962 Act, which will continue to have force when the Bill goes through, are virtually entirely physical activities. It is under the heading of the word "social" that these physical recreative facilities are listed. There is also a reference to "other activities". I hope that the Minister will be able to tell us more of what he has in mind here.<br><br>
This is an important Amendment. While obviously all of us support and encourage physical recreation—swimming, football and so on—which up to now has appeared to be embraced under the heading "social", there is also a need for a new and additional form of outside activity for pupils in our schools.<br><br>
Soon after the Bill is enacted the school-leaving age will be raised and children will be staying on at school for an extra year. I say that optimistically
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 68</span>
because not long ago this great challenge was delayed through the economic incompetence of the Government. But we are now approaching 1972. Three years after the passage of the Bill into law children will be staying on for this extra year. We have asked the Government repeatedly for further information about the form of curriculum which will be followed by the children during this last year. That is central to the question of the raising of the school-leaving age. What will the children be doing at school during this last year? There are other problems, too—the shortage of teachers, school buildings and so on—but the most important question is what the children will be doing with their time during this last year. Will the last year be devoted purely to academic training? Certainly that will be a large part of it, but I trust that more and more into this last year there will be injected new forms of education which will help the child to find his grounding in his career outside, will help to prepare him for citizenship, and will help to train him for life outside.<br><br>
Therefore, we come straight back to the Clause, because it is in the Clause and in the words
<br><blockquote><p>"social, cultural and recreative activities"</p></blockquote>
that much of the means to this end may lie.<br><br>
There appears to me to be a difference between the Bill and the 1962 Act. I hope that the Minister will bear with me if I have misunderstood, but on my reading of the Bill a new responsibility is laid on the Secretary of State. In what will be new Section 1 of the 1962 Act—that is, the provision provided in Clause 1—the local education authority will be providing adequate facilities for
<br><blockquote><p>"social, cultural and recreative activities"</p></blockquote>
But immediately below that we come to What will be new Section 2 of the 1962 Act, which lays down:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may make regulations prescribing the standards and general requirements to which every education authority shall conform in discharging their functions under section 1 of this Act."</p></blockquote>
I presume this means that the Secretary of State is taking unto himself power by which he will or can lay down the standards and the requirements represented by the words
<br><blockquote><p>"social, cultural and recreative activities".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0488">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 69</span>
I presume that the Secretary of State must already have fairly clearly set out in his mind what these
<br><blockquote><p>"social, cultural and recreative activities"</p></blockquote>
will be outside the playing fields and the swimming baths. I return to the significant words "and other activities" in Section 6 of the 1962 Act. It is important, before we proceed further, that the Minister should explain what powers he has in mind and, above all, what shape he believes these
<br><blockquote><p>"social, cultural and recreative activities"</p></blockquote>
will take in future to help the children staying on for this critical last year to fit themselves for the wider world outside school.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make an observation and ask a question.<br><br>
The observation is that I think some congratulation should be given to the Department for its work in recent years in making it more possible for recreational and social organisations to use school facilities after hours. About three and a half years ago I had some correspondence as President of the Scottish Amateur Basketball Association with the Ministry on that issue. At that time organisations which wanted to use school premises faced unreasonable opposition. Recently things have become much better, particularly concerning the use of school facilities in the evenings by organisations. This is good—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not know what other Members feel, but I cannot concentrate on what is being said when a "sub-committee" is taking place in part of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that this good word should be said. It is much easier now for outside organisations to use school facilities, although there still remain a number of janitorial problems.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I anticipate the point of order? I am in some difficulty in separating "social" from "recreative", because we are coming to "recreative facilities" in Amendment No. 5. I carefully followed the hon. Member's argu ments and he eventually came back to "social". I think that the hon. Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) is dealing entirely with recreative facilities.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 70</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am dealing with both. I thought that they were blanketed together, from the speech of the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. The next Amendment deals with recreative facilities. I was hoping that we should get to an interpretation of "social".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Younger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. Surely what the hon. Gentleman is saying, with which I entirely agree, is dealt with in Amendment No. 6.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We will take it as it comes. If the hon. Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) wishes to proceed I am willing to listen.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point has been made that my question covers both social and recreational. It centres round the question of Treasury directives and what teeth there are in this Clause.<br><br>
I should like to ask the Minister to what extent there is some kind of directive, either from the S.E.D. or from the Treasury, that priority is given to those authorities who put forward a meaningful, concrete programme in which social and recreational activities are demonstrably included.<br><br>
To put it in concrete terms, there is at the moment the problem of the Bathgate Athletic Club which does not have proper facilities. In a hypothetical situation, would priority be given to a new school in the Bathgate area by the S.E.D., in its relations with the West Lothian education authority, if it could be demonstrated that in the Bathgate area, as opposed to some other area, there was a meaningful plan in the proposals for social and recreational facilities?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Younger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. I am sorry to interrupt. The last thing I want to be is discourteous. But might I suggest that if the discussion is to continue we might take Amendment No. 6 with Amendment No. 4 and save an extra debate?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why not Amendment No. 5?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I cannot accept that. I think that we are getting into a bog of the differentiation between "social" and "recreative", unless we
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0489">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 71</span>
take Amendments Nos. 4 and 5 together, which would be a more sensible arrangement. However, we are discussing Amendment No. 4 and we will stick to that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am all for saving time. I think that the question has been adequately framed and I sit down hoping that the answer will come.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that we are in some difficulty, because we have taken Amendments 4 and 5 separately, which I understand was the wish of the Opposition.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) drew attention to the inclusion of the word "social" and compared it with Section 6 of the 1962 Act, pointing out that there was no mention of social facilities. However, I would point out that Section 6 of the 1962 Act will be eliminated under Schedule 2 of the Bill. At the top of page 33 there is a new definition of Section 6 of the 1962 Act. There is mention of "social and cultural centres". Therefore, the wording is now in line.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the Minister for calling my attention to that. It simply underlines what we were saying about the terrible confusion confronting people when they try to study the Bill. That does not alter my argument. In Schedule 2 the definition of the provision of facilities under the heading of "social" is very much the same as in the 1962 Act. There does not appear to be a significant change. I am waiting for a reply from the Minister on what social training is to involve, outside the playing fields, in terms of preparing children for life outside.</span></p>
<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has not given me a chance to produce any answer. I was trying to help by saying that if he looked at page 33 he would see the range of provisions, including social and cultural centres. There is no difference in the wording we are providing here and what we are providing in the new Section 6.<br><br>
When we are talking about social, cultural and recreative activities, we are talking about them not only in relation to schoolchildren, but in relation to the community as a whole, and to some extent
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 72</span>
this is real, because the provision in Clause l(3)(<i>a</i>), which gives an education authority a general power to secure for its area these various activities and facilities, is new. In the past it has been possible for an education authority to provide these facilities only, as it were, for organised community activities—evening classes, and activities of that sort. We are widening the provision to give an authority a general power to provide these facilities for the community. I think that this is very much in line with the thinking of hon. Members on both sides of the Committee.<br><br>
In that respect, one thinks particularly of the provision of community centres. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Wright) knows the community centre at Pollok as well as I do. The hon. Gentleman knows, too, that not all the activities carried on there can be called recreative or cultural. Some are purely social. Some members of the community go to the centre as part of their social activities. Sometimes they do nothing more during the evening than sit in the tea room and have a cup of tea and chat with members and friends. This is not a cultural or recreative activity. When old-age pensioners meet there, much of the meeting is taken up with social activities. It is to cover that kind of activity that we have the word "social" in the Bill.<br><br>
Some of the other points which were raised were not quite as relevant to the Amendment as they might have been, if I may say so with respect, but perhaps I might answer the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell). It might save time if I answer it now. It is true that education authorities have, in recent years, been more willing than previously to allow their school facilities to be used by outside organisations for social, cultural, or recreative activities. This is a matter in which we have given education authorities every encouragement. If my hon. Friend would like me to, I could quote from circulars which have been sent out by the Department to encourage education authorities to make a whole range of their facilities more widely available to the community. When one considers sporting activities, it is especially important that there should not be underused facilities, and that outside bodies
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0490">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 73</span>
should have the opportunity to make the fullest use of them.<br><br>
I am not able to say what my attitude will be to any proposal for building schools at Bathgate. All I can say is that, in looking at the school building programme, and at other building programmes, we are very anxious to ensure that authorities provide adequate facilities for social and other activities, as well as providing facilities for formal education.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire raised the issue of the curriculum for the last year at school when the school-leaving age is raised in 1972. I sometimes think that more emphasis is given to this matter than it deserves, at least in the sense that there is some suggestion that schools have not the slightest idea of how to deal with 15- and 16-year-olds. The fact is, of course, that the schools are quite happily and competently dealing with a large number of children in that age group at the moment, not all of whom are studying for O grades, or for their Highers. This is not a problem with which the schools are unfamiliar.<br><br>
In 1966 we produced a document entitled, "Raising the Age: Suggestions for Courses", and sent it to all education authorities. I should not, however, rest the case on that, because this is not something that is decided by the S.E.D. producing nice little documents, sending them to schools, and forgetting about them. Activities and development courses for raising the school-leaving age are going on in schools at the moment. A great variety of effort and experimentation is being put into this. It is difficult to answer these questions in any precise way, because one is dealing with a variety of circumstances, and with headmasters and teachers who have different views about how they should deal with the pupils whom the hon. Gentleman has in mind.<br><br>
Social training and the provision of proper facilities for recreational and cultural activities will play an important part in the activities of all children, not merely those who would otherwise leave at 15, when the school-leaving age is raised in 1972. Part of our effort in recent years has been directed to getting over to schools, to headmasters, and to teachers, the concept that pupils who are
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 74</span>
taking academic subjects and studying for Highers should spend a certain proportion of their time on other activities, including cultural, recreative, and social activities, and non-examinable subjects. This is something which we are encouraging the schools to do, and I think that they are very receptive to ideas of this sort.<br><br>
Having given that explanation I hope the Committee will agree that this word should remain in the Clause. It embraces the concept which is wider in some respects than cultural and recreative, and it would be a pity if the word were deleted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Anthony Stodart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It seems to me, and I think, from what he said, that the Minister confirmed it, that the functions of local authorities are being widened slightly by subsection (3)(<i>a</i>), which was not in the previous Measure. There is no indication in the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum of any estimate of cost following this widening of functions. I realise that it may be difficult to do so, but can the Minister give us any estimate of the cost involved? Is it correct that any extra expenditure involved will be taken into account by the Government in arriving at the figure for the rate support grant?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not burden the Committee with the problems of Bathgate, nor ask for an answer on this question, but I should like to make one observation. A considerable amount of public money is at stake. In the view of some of us, over the last ten years, even with imaginative and progressive local authorities, there has been duplication of expenditure which makes men like the Chief Secretary shudder. When one is dealing with public expenditure, one has to consider these matters very carefully. May we take it that if a local authority goes to the S.E.D. with a proposal to provide social recreational facilities there will be an obligation on the Department to say to that authority, "This will not do, you cannot do this to us"? We have to ensure that social and recreational facilities will be included. This is a question of teeth. If there is not an obligation on the Department to scrutinise every programme which comes
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0491">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 75</span>
before it, this Measure will not be implemented in any meaningful way. Therefore, I put the question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I might deal first with the point raised by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart). There will be some additional expenditure, but it is impossible to say what that might be. I can only say that as education authorities are in any event now providing these facilities to an increasing extent the additional expenditure will be marginal. The matter is mentioned in paragraph 2 on page iv of the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum. The additional expenditure will be eligible for rate support grant.<br><br>
With regard to the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell), I was a little apprehensive about whether I should be allowed to answer his previous point, never mind the one that he has just raised, but, if I may be allowed to answer it, I can give him the assurance that he wants. We take these things very seriously indeed.<br><br>
Perhaps I might give one illustration on the physical recreation side. I have in mind our policy with regard to the provision of swimming pools, a policy which has not always made us popular with local education authorities. To those authorities who have wanted to provide in secondary schools swimming pools almost exclusively for use by their pupils, we have said that we are not normally willing to allow them to do that. We ask them, instead, either on their own, or in co-operation with the town council, to provide, outside the schools, swimming pool facilities which can be used by the schools during the day when they want to use them, and by the community generally at other times. I hope that when we turn down proposals from education authorities who want to build swimming pools exclusively for their own pupils—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has the Minister actually turned down programmes?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I have a deputation coming to see me in the near future. Hon. Members will support us in this policy, which, from a long-term point of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 76</span>
view, I think is right. I was rather apprehensive about straying into this field, but I can give my hon. Friend the assurance for which he asked.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I assume that we shall come to this matter on the next Amendment. I did not follow exactly what my hon. Friend said. Did he suggest that we should have swimming pools outside school premises, for use by the general public?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We shall come to that on the next Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Younger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that we have completely covered that. It seems to me that there is no point in debating the next Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Chair in its wisdom separated Amendments 4 and 5. It was decided to accede to the request that they should be debated separately. The debate has shown the danger of the Chairman being over generous.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He cannot be.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He can be. When we come to the next Amendment, I shall ensure that we stick to "recreative."</span></p>
<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Younger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order. Could we not, if that is the case, combine Amendments 5 and 6 in one debate? It seems to me that three of the debates are interlocking and that we should be wasting time if we considered them separately.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let us be clear about this. We are going to stick to the programme already announced, with Amendment No. 4, then Amendment No. 5. When we come to Amendment No. 6 I shall state what the grouping is.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the reply by the Under-Secretary of State. It has taken us further forward in comprehending what the Government have in mind. He has made, perhaps, a little too light of the curriculum problem in relation to children staying at school for the extra year. Many schools obviously have had experience of teaching 15 and 16 year olds, but it is fair to point out that the children staying on now beyond school-leaving age are doing so voluntarily and with parental encouragement.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0492">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 77</span>
When the school-leaving age is raised statutorily there will as a consequence be a larger number of children staying on as reluctant pupils—not only reluctant, but as pretty big pupils. I suggest that this will throw a strain on teachers, and on the concept of the curriculum.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are not discussing the curriculum. When the hon. Member made his previous observations I allowed on a wide basis the question of the extra year because I thought that he was going to stress the point of social activities in the extra year. That was why I did not then rule out the question of what was to be included in the curriculum, but we are not discussing the curriculum, but the social activities attached to it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With respect, Mr. Jennings, that is the point I am trying to make. I am concerned about the social rôle of the curriculum in equipping children for life outside.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman rightly explained that the word "social" in the Clause, in addition to "cultural" and "recreative", is there in order to provide for the scope of facilities required in the whole field of education. I felt, however, that his interpretation of "social" was too restrictive, in the sense of suggesting a sort of tea party occasion rather than the training in civics which I had hoped it represented. I look for more reassurance on this point, and perhaps the hon. Gentleman would like to intervene again. It is important to know how broadly "social" can be interpreted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It can be interpreted as broadly as one likes. We are not laying down the curriculum at present for secondary schools. We do not now talk about "civics", as I understand it, but "modern studies", a phrase which embraces a good deal more than the old conception of civics, which sounded, and often was, the dullest subject in the curriculum.<br><br>
The idea of social training is not new It goes back at least to the amendment made to the Education Act by the Physical Training and Recreation Act, 1937, where there is reference to facilities for social training. Of course, the social content of education, in the widest sense, is an important part of education, and,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 78</span>
as I recollect it, a whole section was devoted in the memorandum to suggestions for courses following the raising of the school-leaving age.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the hon. Gentleman. He has gone a long way to answering our questions, although not as completely as we had hoped. However, in view of his reply, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 5, in page 2, line 12, leave out 'recreative'.<br><br>
I may have opened a door unwittingly. It was originally our intention to concentrate the debate on the previous Amendment and simply leave Amendment No. 5 as a drafting matter. The word "recreative" is new, as far as I know, to education legislation. In the 1962 Act, for example, the phrase "facilities for recreation" constantly appears, as does the word "recreational", but the word "recreative" does not appear, as far as I know. It is an ugly word. I presume that it means "recreational". If so, why not say so, instead of introducing a new and rather ugly word?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Good intentions should be translated into deeds and reality. I pose a problem and ask a question.<br><br>
The problem is that, among several authorities, it seems that a muddle has been made over the provision of adequate football pitches and other recreative facilities. In some localities the situation has almost reached the degree of a scandal. For example, my constituents at Boghall, Bathgate, are bewildered by the situation concerning the football pitch at St. Columba's School.<br><br>
In the Scottish Education Department, is there any clear cost organisation which progress chases what the smaller authorities at any rate are doing in the provision of recreation and recreational facilities? What technical advice is available to the Department? Does it bring in firms like En-Tout-Cas which have done many experiments on all weather pitches and the like? What expert advice is available to the Department in making sure that local authorities, in the provision of recreational facilities such as football pitches, get

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 79</span>
value for money? In my experience, we are far from the situation of getting value for money.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) asked why it should Be "recreative" rather than "recreational". I would not care to answer off the cuff, or, indeed, perhaps, at all. But "recreative" is not a new word. It was in the 1962 Act. I have not combed right through the Act but the word is in Section 4(<i>c</i>). Since it is used there, I see no reason for changing it to "recreational" in this Bill. It seems to me that the two words mean the same thing.<br><br>
Of course, we have expert advice available, and we need not look outside the Department for it because a number of our inspectors are on further education, including informal further education, all the time. A strong team of them are involved. I do not think I can, on this Amendment, describe the various procedures for processing propositions put up by education authorities or anyone else, but advice is available through the Department, and I have not received any complaint that it has not been made available on application by any authority.<br><br>
I am sure that we shall be able to give advice and assistance about any local problems, but I make it clear that education authorities and town councils and even district councils have certain powers under the Physical Training and Recreation Act, 1937. It is not for the Government, as it were, to take over powers and do the job for them at local level. This has to depend on local initiative and activity. We give every help we can, but we cannot tell them what they should be doing or do the job for them. That would be a misconception of the relationship between central Government and local government on such matters.<br><br>
I am not aware that we are not helpful in every way to authorities which wish to make provision and get assistance from us. I am not saying that we will always accept any proposition and that money will be available for everything—that would be the ideal world—but there is no dearth of advice and assistance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to see the Amendment, particularly since "recrea-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 80</span>
tive" includes swimming as one of its aspects. I rise because I have recently had a communication from one of our national swimming organisations telling me that its swimming facilities are being reduced. I thought that, in view of this, we might have a look at swimming as a part of education.<br><br>
I have been associated with swimming all my life. The two exercises which I have mostly pursued have been swimming and golf. I urge them on all boys and young people because they are recreations which one can pursue throughout one's life. Games like football and cricket are restricted because they are not so easy to play after a certain age. This is why I have been active in promoting swimming organisations in whatever capacity I have been able to do so.<br><br>
As an individual responsible for carrying on this work under Glasgow Education Authority I have always found a ready response from adults. When facilities were organised by me in certain schools for adults they were well patronised. But at day school there has to be a good deal of encouragement for the boys and girls when they go to the swimming pool because, during the winter months, they find it more comfortable to accommodate themselves in the gallery and look down on their chums in the water and the teachers consequently have some difficulty. But this situation in certain schools is encouraged by the fact that the facilities are at another centre. I will instance a case which comes within the knowledge, or at any rate the geographical interest, of my hon. Friend. The boys and girls in Pollok schools have to travel to Pollokshaws for swimming, which is an abnormal waste of educational time. It also means that when the children get to the swimming pool, even though by bus, the urge has gone, especially if it is a dirty winter's day. I do not know how far this still continues, but I agree with what my hon. Friend has said about the encouragement that Glasgow Corporation and the Education Committee give young people to learn swimming.<br><br>
Boys and girls must swim for a purpose. It should be part and parcel of the lesson. Every boy or girl should set his or her mind or be encouraged to prepare for the Royal Humane Society's Medal. They should all attain the bronze
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0494">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 81</span>
at least, if not the silver. This gives them a purpose. If the work is to be done adequately, it is essential that facilities should be in school and that should be an aim of every education authority whether the facilities are for further education or for primary education.<br><br>
12 noon.<br><br>
I have organised and carried on these classes in further education. Again, I have found a great response, but nearness to the school is essential. I am glad to see that, in the new school which has been built near Pollokshaws, a first-class pool has been included. However, when my hon. Friend was speaking, he confined himself solely to saying that secondary schools should have swimming facilities. I would extend that, because I think that every primary school should aim at having swimming facilities within the school. In the City of Glasgow, the former education authority provided swimming facilities in a primary school which were a great help in promoting further education classes. Those two types of education can function together more easily if facilities for these recreative purposes are available in every school.<br><br>
I know that, very often, cost is the chief barrier to the fruition of our purpose. I do not deny that every member of a local authority and my hon. Friend in his Department want to provide these facilities. Just as we aim at providing a gymnasium in every school, so there should be a swimming pool. But certainly cost is a serious factor and we must allow for it. I think that I am pushing at an open door, because my hon. Friend has made it clear that his Department is encouraging the development where possible of this phase of education in every school throughout the country. In prompting local authorities to push ahead with this type of development, I hope that my hon. Friend and his Department will do their best to see that, where financial difficulties exist, they, by themselves, will not be a barrier to this very necessary provision in education.<br><br>
I return to the point with which I began. I do not know whether protests have come to my hon. Friend from any of our swimming organisations about the general lack of facilities in Scotland; the tendency to reduce facilities or not to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 82</span>
promote further facilities. I have received such a protest and, if my hon. Friend has heard nothing, I will send it to him. I hope that he will look into the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stodart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Jennings, I am sure that you and all other hon. Members will be the first to agree that any children will be very fortunate who benefit from recreative facilities at school and gain as much advantage from swimming as the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin)—certainly it has kept him very young—and attain his prowess and eventually captain their golf clubs. However, could the hon. Gentleman tell us something which would be of enormous advantage and about which I do not pretend to be entirely uninterested? Is the best way of getting down one's handicap to have a swim before playing golf or afterwards?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: After.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I make no apology for returning to the matter which I have raised, because vast sums of public expenditure are involved. It is true that advice is available to local authorities. It is equally true that the S.E.D. is helpful. It is also true that there is a strong team of inspectors available. Nevertheless, the fact is that, when I go to modern schools and see some of their playing fields, I see a situation which would appall the Public Accounts Committee.<br><br>
For three years, I was a Member of that Committee under the Chairmanship of my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister, and my right hon. Friend the Member for Sowerby (Mr. Houghton), and the right hon. Member for Kingston-upon-Thames (Mr. Boyd-Carpenter). If any of them had seen what I have seen, it would shock them and produce very unfavourable Reports. Three weeks ago, I visited St. Colomba's School in Bathgate. The playing field was a quagmire. A great deal of money was spent on it. In my view, the plans were not very well thought out in the first place. By no stretch of the imagination to the pupils of the Boghall area of Bathgate in my constituency get "adequate provision for recreational facilities".<br><br>
There are certain consequences flowing from this. My hon. Friend is right when he says that there is a tricky relationship between central Government
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0495">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 83</span>
and local initiative, but I am not sure that it should be called local initiative, because sometimes it is local ignorance, otherwise the situations which I have seen would not have arisen.<br><br>
More and more as I sit in these Committees I am bothered about what the House of Commons does. We express all these good intentions about the provision of facilities for social, cultural, educational and recreational purposes. How do we turn them into reality? Yes, it is true, as my hon. Friend says, that advice is available to local authorities, yes, it is true that the S.E.D. is helpful; Yes, it is also true we have strong teams of inspectors; Yes, there is good will. In spite of everything, the goods are not produced. How come? We cannot pass by like the Levite on the other side of the road without asking penetrating questions. If the inspectors are there, if the S.E.D. is helpful, if all this advice is available, how is it that in school after school the playing fields are a costly disgrace? Does not the S.E.D. consider, given the sort of situation that I have outlined, how it can make sure that the taxpayer gets value for money? One of our functions in Parliament should be to act as the watchdog on public expenditure. In view of all the agony of this Government over public expenditure, what is proposed to be done to ensure that there is the same scrutiny in local authority spending as we apply to major Government Departments?<br><br>
Earlier on, I praised the S.E.D. and said that I thought that it did a good job in many activities. However, I am profoundly dissatisfied with what it is doing in terms of cost control, getting value for money and making sure that the vast public expenditures which are made produce results which are worthy of them. Therefore, I repeat my questions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Milan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) asked if we were reducing the provision of swimming facilities in Scotland. In fact, swimming facilities are being increased both in terms of what is provided at the educational level and in terms of public facilities. Incidentally, in the new swimming pool in Edinburgh for the coming Commonwealth Games we shall
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 84</span>
have a first-class international pool. In addition, we have the fine facilities recently provided in East Kilbride. A number of other authorities, too, have projects for the building of swimming pools.<br><br>
There is more money and effort being expended on improving swimming pool facilities in Scotland today than at any time since the end of the Second World War. Very few public pools were built between about 1910 and a few years ago. Most of our public swimming pool facilities were provided in the last years of the 19th century and the first years of the present century. During the long period between then and a few years ago, virtually nothing was done to provide public facilities. That position is now being remedied, though not as quickly as we would like.<br><br>
As for the balance between providing facilities in educational establishments and outside, that is a matter on which it is possible to take differing views, depending on the angle from which one looks at the problem. I would distinguish between facilities required for pupils learning to swim, with learner pools and swimming instruction, and the facilities required for purpils who have learned to swim and who look upon the pool as a place where they can enjoy themselves as well as receive instruction. It is difficult to provide adequate facilities for senior pupils to enjoy themselves swimming if they are provided simply in the senior schools. Swimming pools are expensive propositions and, if they are built to any size at all, the result is a pool which is really more than one requires simply for the school. They should be available to the community at large. As my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Govan said, swimming is a recreation which can be enjoyed by anyone at any age and, therefore, facilities should be available generally. Normally, it is better for facilities to be provided outside schools, with access to secondary and primary schools in the area and also to the public. In that way, it is possible to provide better and more expensive facilities, with adequate changing accommodation for adults, without depriving pupils of facilities during the day, which is when they want them.<br><br>
That is the kind of general policy to which we have worked, and it applies even to further education colleges. In the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0496">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 85</span>
case of the Cardonald College in my constituency, we took the view that a swimming pool should not be provided at the College, but that if the authority wanted to spend money on facilities, they should be provided for the public in the area. My hon. Friend also knows the old Govan Baths. If the authority wants to spend money, let it spend it on genuine public facilities which will be available to anyone, including further education students. That is distinct from somewhere like the Langside College, where there is a pool within the College which is not open to the public and which is not a large pool of the sort which adults would normally want to go to for recreation.</span></p>
<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend agree that where pupils have during school hours to travel to a central pool then the time factor can become serious?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is another way of saying that we ought to have adequate facilities, and that in a city like Glasgow one should not be dependent on one or two pools. Obviously, there ought to be district swimming pools so as to avoid lengthy journeys. In an area where there is a small community the public pool may be more easily accessible. A pool in a school may not be accessible to the population generally.<br><br>
I would not accept the criticism of my hon. Friend the Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) as being a general description of the situation in Scotland today. There are, of course, standards in the provision of playing fields and other facilities in the building of schools, and there are also cost limits which apply to school building generally. No authority has ever complained to me that the cost limits were too generous; quite a number have complained that the cost limits were not generous enough. I would, therefore, dispute the proposition that large sums of money are being wasted in any area of school building, whether on playing fields or in the provision of the buildings.<br><br>
I must reiterate the point that there is a limit to what the Government can do in a matter of this sort. There is also a limit to the detailed standards which we can lay down. It is normally a criticism of Government that we try to control things too finely, in too detailed
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 86</span>
a way, and ought to allow education authorities to get on with the job. There is a fair amount of validity in that criticism. If we are to have education authorities which are responsible for important and fundamental matters in education, we must give them a certain amount of credit in areas of building provision and in these other important areas, and a balance has to be drawn between what the Department would like in a particular situation and what the local authority may wish to provide.<br><br>
Expert advice is available. That advise is always available in other directions through the S.C.P.R. For example, there is a good deal more advice coming from Government through the Sports Council for Scotland and the Great Britain Sports Council. If authorities are not providing adequately, or are making silly mistakes, or mistakes in the fundamentals of provision, it is not because advice and assistance are not available. Perhaps not in every case does an authority do the job as well as other authorities, but within the limits of the relationship which I have laid down we pay a good deal of attention to this. We are not happy about allowing authorities to spend money <i>ad lib</i> with no regard for the standards of the facility; in fact, the criticism is normally in the other direction.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must observe that if authorities do not come to the Department it is because they have their <i>amour propre</i> and do not wish to reveal their own inadequacies. Twenty years ago when it was a question of providing some grass, small authorities could do this, but we are now living in an age when facilities are more sophisticated, and I wish that they would admit sometimes that they need help. I shall be putting down some particular Questions about the amount of advice which certain authorities have sought from the Department.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The debate has been an interesting one, which has ranged over a very wide field—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A muddy field, too!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</span><span class='membercontribution'>: —and sometimes a muddy one. I come back to where I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0497">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 87</span>
began, which was with the word "recreative". I am not sure that I accept that the word becomes entirely respectable because it appears at least on one occasion in the 1962 Act. I still dislike it thoroughly and would prefer the use of the word "educational". Nevertheless, it would be inappropriate for me to attach too much importance to this verbal point, and I do not propose to press the Amendment further. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Younger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 6, in page 2, line 13, at end insert:
<br><blockquote><p>(4) Without prejudice to the provisions of subsection (3)(<i>a</i>) above, every education authority shall be under a duty to make available for the use of ratepayers in their area, subject to such conditions, including the payment of charges and times of use, as they think fit, the facilities in terms of the preceding subsection.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think it would be for the convenience of the Committee that with this Amendment we should take also Amendment No. 8, in page 2, line 23, leave out 'charge fees' and insert 'make charges'. In that case I would allow Amendment No. 8 to be moved formally and a separate vote taken if desired.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Younger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know if you can observe the halo which is glittering brightly over my head, Mr. Jennings, but it appears that practically everyone in the Committee has discussed what is contained in this Amendment before we reached it. That is not altogether inappropriate, as the first speech I ever made in this Committee was one calling for brevity and less waste of time. I am, therefore, able this morning to add deeds to my words of some years ago and make a much shorter speech on this Amendment than I had originally thought.<br><br>
This is entirely an exploratory Amendment. I have no intention of pressing it and it is moved in order to elucidate the intentions of the Minister.<br><br>
I support and agree with practically everything that was said by the hon. Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell). I will not repeat his arguments but will reinforce them by saying that I believe
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 88</span>
he is substantially justified in the pleas he has made, and that the Minister should go a little further in satisfying the desire, which I share with the hon. Member for West Lothian, that we should introduce a new principle in the provision of recreational facilities generally, including sports and everything else, which would involve much more public participation in these facilities.<br><br>
I welcome very much the fact that during the last few years there has been a notable improvement and extension in the use of school facilities by members of the public, but there are still gaps. There are still cases where requests are refused for perfectly genuine and harmless activities which in a small town can take place nowhere else but in the facilities provided by the education authority. Two years ago I had experience, not in my own constituency, of a request to use a beautiful new school hall for a concert out of school hours. It would in no way have endangered the cleanliness and general upkeep of the hall. This request was refused, I thought quite unreasonably, because it would have involved a little extra trouble for the staff.<br><br>
I welcome what the Minister said, that his intentions are that wherever possible this should be done, and I hope that his words will be noted by the small minority of local education authorities which may not be so liberal as are most such authorities. There are many towns in Scotland with no other suitable halls for dramatic productions, with all the scenery involved, and rehearsals. This may mean considerable disturbance to school staffs if a local company wishes to put on a dramatic production for a whole week. Subject to the financial side of it being straightened out and the payment of a proper fee, I hope that what the Minister has said will give encouragement to all people involved in education to realise that there is a benefit to be gained by the whole community in the provision of such facilities.<br><br>
I will not repeat what has been sadi about sporting facilities. I agree with what was said about swimming pools, to which should be added tennis courts, and, to some extent, playing fields, although here there is a factor which has not been sufficiently emphasised. At this time of the year, playing fields are extremely heavily used and they get very worn.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0498">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 89</span>
One must be careful not to say that all local education authorities must on all occasions let anyone play football on their playing fields. Nevertheless, this should be encouraged wherever possible.<br><br>
I come finally to the matter of a new principle. The hon. Member for West Lothian was on a good point here. It is not enough to say that the intentions of the Minister and of the Scottish Education Department are admirable, which they are. It is not enough to say that the intentions of the local education authority are admirable, though they usually are. It is not enough to say that everybody concerned wishes, hopes and intends that facilities for recreation provided at public expense as part of school building will be made available to the community. It is not enough to say that our intentions are honourable. I believe that a new principle should be established, that where public money is spent on recreational facilities there should be a permanent and official tie up between the planning authorities, the local authorities, the education authorities who do the school building and the Scottish Education Department, which approves the school building, so as to ensure automatically that the money is spent in such a way that the public can always have the fullest use of these facilities.<br><br>
This would mean provision in the swimming pool for adult changing rooms, as has been said. Much more than that, it means that school halls must be built in such a way that the public can use them without disturbing the school; it means that tennis courts and indoor gymnasia should be constructed in such a way that there is more general public access to them. I know that the Minister wants this. He has more or less said so, and I know that he would himself support this, but I ask him to look at this carefully to see whether there is not a need for a formal and necessary procedure to ensure that from now on all big schools shall be built with the public in mind just as much as the children.<br><br>
I am not saying that once they are built the public shall have priority over the children. That would be quite wrong. I am prepared to say that at all times the school requirements must have priority and that if the school requires
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 90</span>
the facilities the public cannot have them; but the public must have equal access, subject to that. This is most relevant during school holidays and at times of the day when the school is not normally used for educational purposes, notably during the evening.<br><br>
I have put my argument as shortly as I can. I in no way suggest that the Minister's intentions, which he expressed a little while ago, are anything but absolutely genuine. I ask him seriously to consider—he may not be able to give the answer right away—whether it is not necessary to have a more definite and a more automatic procedure to ensure that our planning produces better facilities for full public participation in all recreational facilities which are built as part of educational building. It would be a marvellous step forward if he could do this, for which we would be most grateful.</span></p>
<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Small</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) spoke about a halo. I do not know how many angels can dance on the point of a needle. I can agree with the suggestion contained in the Amendment, subject to conditions. What it proposes is in fact what is happening already.<br><br>
I am concerned with the practicalities of life. Living in Ayrshire and representing a Glasgow constituency, let me give a practical illustration for Ayrshire and Bute. I find that there is often a contest between the practical requirements of many local ratepayers and the education authorities. The local ratepayers have certain use of the schools over a whole season for concerts and many things, and then find themselves disfranchised, as it were, because the education authorities have made commitments. Having had access to school facilities for some part of the year in the long summer recess the ratepayers feel that they have been disfranchised and cheated, and there is a degree of friction between them and the education authorities.<br><br>
Schools now being built cost, in round terms, about £frac34; million. The designers, architects and others have in mind that the facilities will be for joint use, because they will be for social as well as an educational use. It would be wrong to tie
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0499">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 91</span>
down the education authorities, in the terms of the Amendment, by saying that they "shall be under a duty". They are subject to certain conditions, but I would lay down others.<br><br>
One is the provision of an electrician. Then, janitors in our schools have a 40-hour week. Saturdays are out. But Saturday is a day when the ratepayers are free to make use of the schools. I do not want to go into too many practical details. Generally, arrangements between local authorities and their ratepayers concerning use of school buildings are best left to them locally. Generally, I have not found, up to now, any great difficulty over the natural requirements of the ratepayers to use schools, which are public property.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward M. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to say a few words on the Amendment. First, I should apologise for not being here earlier. However, the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) and I were in the Committee on the Shipbuilding Industry Bill. It was expected to go on longer, but our new Clauses were all out of order and the Committee finished early.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Scotstoun (Mr. Small) was right in saying that these schools are very fully used. Certainly in the newer areas they are the focal point of community life.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman also touched on a point, which I hope the Minister will look into even if he cannot give any commitment, concerning Saturdays. It would be unreasonable to say that all schools on Saturdays and Sundays should be fully used. The janitors, who have a 40-hour week, interpret this very flexibly. Even if it means going on for a few hours on Tuesday and Wednesday nights, they do it. The janitors in Glasgow schools should be commended for their attitude.<br><br>
On the other hand, in many new housing areas there is a need for community and recreational facilities, and Saturday is a very important day indeed. While, on the one hand, it is wrong to say that there should be an absolute obligation that schools and school halls should be made available on Saturdays, on the other hand, we must accept that in many of our new housing areas, which are starved of amenities, it is wrong that the young
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 92</span>
people should be forced to find their recreation in the town centres or elsewhere. General experience is that when young people go in a body elsewhere to find recreation, their behaviour perhaps is not the same as it would be in their own communities. If we can find ways and means of providing recreation for young people in their own areas we shall be making a sterling contribution to the life of those areas. One thing is vital. We know that in the new housing areas many young people like to go to a dance on a Saturday night. We do not have any dance halls in the big Glasgow housing schemes. Obviously, there would not be the demand for them all the week and money could not be made. Apart from anything else, the sheer pressure of land use means that we have not got facilities like this in the big housing areas.<br><br>
Is there some way in which this problem can be overcome? It would be unreasonable to say to janitors, "You will do a six day week", or, to those with Sunday school activities, "You will do a seven day week". However, it seems indefensible that, with these splendid new schools with wonderful facilities the young people should be deprived of the opportunity of having dances in the school hall on a Saturday night organised either by voluntary organisations or private individuals. We should try to overcome this problem. Obviously we cannot put additional burdens on our school janitors who already have a hard time, but would it be possible for the Minister to have discussions with local authorities to see whether there is any way in which we could have a pool of janitors, or persons with other employment but willing to work at weekends, and who could come into the schools on Saturday nights so that proper supervision could be maintained at dances taking place?<br><br>
It is sometimes suggested, on the basis of one or two Press reports in individual cases, that when there is a big Saturday night dance there is trouble. But, having had some limited experience of participating in and organising these functions, I would say that in general, if there is adequate supervision, trouble does not happen and worthwhile benefits accrue.<br><br>
We will have to find a way of dealing with the problem. This would not

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 93</span>
necessarily mean a compulsory obligation, but perhaps, as has been suggested, a move in this direction might be started. If we are to make provision in these areas, could not a move in this direction be started?<br><br>
The hon. Member for Scotstoun has in his constituency a large area of Drum-chapel. The problems there are similar to those in my own constituency in Glasgow. We have vast housing areas starved of amenities, although progress is being made. We have community centres, which are doing well and making big contributions, and swimming pools are being built and so on; but, as regards commercial recreation and dancing, there is little outside our churches and church halls. This is understandable. I do not think that we should blame our previous legislators for this. If the people had been asked in 1945, "Do you want houses or communities?" they would unquestionably have said, "Give us the houses, which is the main task, and we can get all the other things later." That decision was made, but I think on reflection that it was probably wrong, because it is right to build communities and provide all the facilities.<br><br>
In Glasgow and elsewhere we have large housing areas where there is little open at night. Until three years ago the only thing open at night in my constituency was a chip shop—not a cafe. We did not have a community centre but progress is now being made. We need specific provision for entertainment on Saturday nights, whether recreational facilities or dances, so let us make a move. We have these wonderful school halls just asking to be used and young people are anxious to make use of them. There must be some way of coping with the problems.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will give an indication that he is aware of the problems, as I think he is, and might be prepared to initiate discussions with local authorities which might lead to a way of dealing with supervising these schools perhaps by a pool of janitors or people who could serve the functions of janitors at least on Saturdays. Sundays are not really a problem, because there are usually religious activities, but Saturday is the one day in the week when we could make use of the facilities
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 94</span>
we have, and perhaps we could make some progress in that direction.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Margaret Herbison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have some sympathy with the Amendment.<br><br>
In reply to a previous Amendment the Under-Secretary of State said that there is a limit to what the Government can do. I take it that he would say to this Amendment that there is a limit to the control which the central Department can exercise over local authorities, and I should have to accept that.<br><br>
The Minister, again in reply to a previous Amendment, spoke about the circulars which had been sent to education authorities. I know something about those circulars. From the contributions we have had on the Amendment, it is evident that there is at least some dissatisfaction with the attitude of some local authorities to the use of the premises for which they are responsible.<br><br>
I find, unlike the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger), that there is no difficulty in my area about acquiring school halls for concerts, dramatic shows and so on. The local education authority is very good in these matters. But in other matters which are much more connected with sport, its attitude is quite different.<br><br>
My hon. Friend has had some contact with the Scotia Sports Club in my constituency. We have heard about the big housing developments in Glasgow. There is a very big housing development to the north of Glasgow at Bishopbriggs with very few facilities for recreation. The Scotia Sports Club has devoted men and women running it. They have felt over the years that they are baulked at every turn in their efforts to find suitable sports facilities for the young and the not so young in the area, because the range of facilities which they are trying to provide is very wide indeed. They tried at one stage to get the use of the spray baths in the school on a Saturday morning or afternoon when they were not being used, but the education authority was unwilling to let them have this facility. These men and women are devoting a great deal of their leisure time to the young and to the not so young in the Bishopbriggs area, but time and again they find that members are drifting off because there are no facilities for them. That is a very bad thing indeed.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 95</span>
Young people who stay at school to 18 years of age have very great advantages, particularly if attached to their school are all kinds of extra curricula activities. They have the advantage of swimming pools, where there are swimming pools, and sports fields attached to the schools. Therefore, they not only have considerable educational advantages, which I want them to have, but they also have very great advantages for the following of recreational activities. It seems to me that there is a responsibility on the central Department to ensure that, by whatever means it may decide, young people who leave school at 15 are given the same recreational advantages as those who stay at school till 18 years of age.<br><br>
I have always believed that education is not merely teaching the "three Rs" or trying to develop young people intellectually; education should be the development of all the talents, whatever they are, of every individual child. These talents sometimes include prowess on the sports field, whatever the sport may be. It has always seemed to me that we should have less trouble, and less juvenile and adolescent delinquency, if our schools were to develop that side of our children very much more than has ever been done.</span></p>
<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the argument is pursued too far about the responsibility belonging to local authorities, does not my right hon. Friend feel that Parliament passing verbiage like this is little better than a charade? It is either one thing or the other.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Herbison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may be either one thing or the other. What I am concerned about this morning is to ensure, by one means or another, that local education authorities know that the central Department is determined to do the things which my hon. Friend and I, and hon. Gentlemen opposite, wish to do. I hope that enough has been said this morning to impress on the Minister—if it needs to be impressed on him—and on the Government that many hon. Members, on both sides of the Committee, feel that there is a definite lack of facilities for these activities.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 96</span>
There has been talk about the difficulties of janitors. I call this an excuse for not giving facilities to the Scotia Sports Club. It seems to me that an education authority ought to be as interested in what is happening to those who have left school, as it is in those who are still If school. If facilities can be provided for those at school, then, even though it may be difficult, and I do not know how the difficulty can be overcome, it does not seem to me that providing the facilities which I consider to be so important is such a stumbling block that we must accept it as such and say that it is impossible to provide them.<br><br>
The Minister has sent out circulars. What steps does he take to find out whether the advice—because that is all it is—given in those circulars is followed? When a club such as the one to which I have referred comes up against a difficulty, it often finds that it has no recourse to higher authority. The education authority having made a decision there is no one at a higher level to whom the club can appeal.<br><br>
That is why I have some sympathy with the Amendment. What power, if any, does my hon. Friend have over local authorities? Depending on his answer I shall decide whether, on Report, to move an Amendment—not this one, but another one—to ensure that people who are willing to give up their time and their energy, and devote themselves to helping young people, are not baulked at every turn.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is entirely in order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Only 10 minutes remain before the Committee adjourns. If the Minister feels that he can say all that he wants to in that time, good and well.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is not a point of order. We have to await events.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not for me to bring any debate to conclusion. If we do not finish this discussion by one o'clock, that will give hon. Members the opportunity to think over what I have said and on Thursday to produce even more convincing arguments than they have done today.<br><br>
I have every sympathy with what was said by the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger), and the intention behind the Amendment. There is no difference between us about what he is trying to achieve, and the desirability of achieving it. Nevertheless, the Amendment is defective, and I shall have to ask the Committee to resist it.<br><br>
There are one or two technical defects in the Amendment, but I mention them only for completeness. I am not resting my case on that aspect of the matter. The Amendment refers to ratepayers. This is unfortunate, because one wants to make the facilities available to young people, who, normally, are not ratepayers. Young people would be cut out by the use of this word.<br><br>
The Amendment refers not just to school facilities, which is what the hon. Gentleman has in mind, but to further education and other facilities as well, such as community centres. Presumably the Amendment is not directed to any problem of the use of community centres which are normally available at reasonable hours for all members of the community.<br><br>
The other point about the drafting to which I want to draw attention is one which illustrates a fundamental difficulty. I think that the drafting of the Amendment is irreconcilable with what the hon. Gentleman is trying to achieve. He suggests that the local education authority should be under a duty to make facilities available, but he qualifies that by saying that that duty shall be subject to such conditions as the authority may see fit to impose. The hon. Gentleman is faced with a dilemma. He recognises that we
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 98</span>
cannot place an absolute obligation on any authority to make facilities available without conditions. Once we impose a duty which is subject to such conditions as the local authority may lay down we remove that duty altogether and make it what is virtually a power, because the authority may, on the question of using school halls on a Saturday, decide that one condition by which it discharges its duty and makes the facilities available is that they will not be available on Saturdays. There is nothing in the drafting of the Amendment to prevent that.<br><br>
I do not think that it is possible to produce a draft which will get over that fundamental difficulty. I am not criticising the hon. Gentleman's draftmanship. I am merely saying that the problem is not one which can be dealt with by an Amendment to the Bill. If anyone can produce the kind of ingenious drafting which will achieve what the hon. Gentleman wants I should certainly consider it very seriously, but I feel that, as things stand, it is impossible to do what the hon. Gentleman has in mind, and what I think all hon. Members would support him in doing, by amending the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maclennan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept the argument about the drafting and, indeed, would have advanced it had I had the opportunity to do so, but would not my hon. Friend agree that it should be possible to draft an Amendment which, by any canon of statutory interpretation, would ensure that any provision aimed at defeating the obvious purpose of the Clause would be rendered null?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is on to quite a good point, and if I were to apply my mind to redrafting the Amendment I think I should probably be able to improve it.<br><br>
There is another consideration which I must put before the Committee. This is not merely a question of drafting, but one of the relationship between what the Government can do and what a local authority can do in the light and knowledge of its local circumstances. I was asked what formal procedures there were for the building of schools to ensure that other facilities were taken into account. Other procedures are available now. When an authority wishes to provide additional facilities the matter is given serious consideration. There are formal procedures for considering such
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0503">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 99</span>
matters, but what hon. Members do not always appreciate is that there is, as it were, a day-to-day informal relationship between authorities and the Department on matters of this sort, largely through the liaison of the Inspectorate. I do not think that one should formalise this and say that all approaches from an education authority to the Department should be on a formal basis. The relationship is not like that. Largely through the Inspectorate, problems such as this can be dealt with on a day-to-day basis by discussions between the education authority and the Inspectorate and also formally in discussions between the authority and the Department as a Department. I do not think that there is any difficulty in the procedure, whether formal or informal, for dealing with a matter of this sort.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is rather disturbing. Does it mean that the Department accepts responsibility for some of the alleged fiascos which have taken place?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If he has not done so, I suggest that my hon. Friend should read the Estimates Committee's report on Her Majesty's Inspectorate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Oh, I have.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If my hon. Friend got the message of the Report, he will understand how fruitful this relationship is between the Inspectorate and local education authorities, but there are responsibilities which rest with education authorities, and those which rest with the Department. I am surprised at' the enthusiasm being shown by everyone for the Department telling local education authorities how they should go about their business. This is very much against the criticism which is normally made, namely, that we do not allow local education authorities to get on with their business.<br><br>
One hon. Member said that the facilities in secondary schools should always be available to the general public, that there should be separate access, and so on. But even a matter such as this is one which must be considered in the light of local circumstances. I can think of one or two schools in the Highlands
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 100</span>
where part of the school has been set aside as a youth wing or community centre. It is integrated with the school, but there is a separate access for people going there in the evening. I can think of a primary school where the hall has been built in such a way that it is possible to cut off the rest of the school and provide access to the hall in the evening when it is used for local community facilities.<br><br>
All those things can be, and are being done now by education authorities. It does not always follow that secondary schools—and one is normally thinking of secondary schools in this context—should be the focal point for community or youth activities. Some of the young people whom we are trying to get at through education authorities and other youth centres are unattracted to youth clubs which are run in secondary schools, merely because of the association which these schools have with what, for them, was an unsatisfactory and unhappy school life. One does not necessarily want to use a school as a youth centre to provide group facilities. In most areas, and certainly in the big urban areas, I think that there should be separate facilities for youngsters, rather than that we should have to rely on the use of school halls, because many young people will never be attracted to them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Brewis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In a scattered rural area a village hall which is not doing very well may close down altogether, or the local community association may collapse, if facilities are provided in schools.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is another illustration of the fact that in all this one has to have regard to local circumstances. It is not possible for me as a Minister, nor do I think it is possible for my officials, to lay down that something should happen in a given local area, regardless of the local circumstances.</span></p>
