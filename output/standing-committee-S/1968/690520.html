	<p>[MR. JOHN ROBERTSON in the Chair]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>HOUSING (SCOTLAND) BILL</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That during the proceedings on the Housing (Scotland) Bill the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock, and, with effect from Tuesday, 10th June, on Tuesdays at Four o'clock.—[	<i>Dr. Dickson Mabon.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to say straight away that the Opposition appreciate the need to get the Bill on the Statute Book by the end of the Session. Many people wish to apply for house improvement grants, and we want them to be able to obtain those grants as soon as possible. While appreciating the need to have the Bill on the Statute Book by August, and I assure the Minister that we are anxious to do all we can to help its progress, because we believe it to be a good Bill. I must put on record that it is also our duty in Committee, apart from making sure that we get good Bills in principle on the Statute Book, to ensure that the Bills themselves are properly scrutinised and improved. To do that we must have sufficient time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, in the last month or two we have had a rush to try to get through the Town and Country Planning Bill. As my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) said several times during our deliberations on that Bill, we should have given a great deal more time to the detailed and important matters it contained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are under pressure with their legislation. I can best illustrate the need for us to scrutinise the Bill properly by pointing to the fact that even before it is discussed in Committee, the Government have already tabled 66 Amendments. Of their own accord, the Government had demonstrated the need for the Bill to be scrutinised closely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have no intention of holding up the proceedings of the Committee, and it is our intention to get the Bill on to the Statute
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
Book in the best form possible, but I hope that the Government appreciate that it is necessary to go through the Bill properly, to improve it and to correct it in detail as well as principle. The rush and pressure put on hon. Members are of the Government's own making.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, recognise the need to get the Bill through as quickly as possible with all the strengthening that will come from its examination in Committee. However, I want to make it clear that three meetings a week will be difficult for some of us. Tuesday afternoon will fall particularly heavily on me, because it is an afternoon already devoted to another strong interest of mine. If I am not as frequently here as I desire, although it might be a disguised blessing in some ways, it will be a matter of regret to me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the sittings Motion, but it is right to protest about the amount of legislation being put before this Committee. In this Session we have discussed the Education (Scotland) Bill, with 29 Clauses in 14 sittings, the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Bill, with 106 Clauses and 10 Schedules in 11 sittings, and now we are being asked to consider the Housing (Scotland) Bill with 67 Clauses in about nine sittings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I compare this with the time it took Bills to go through this Committee a few years ago. For instance, the Local Government Finance (Scotland) Bill of 1963/4, 12 Clauses in 13 sittings, the Financial Provisions (Scotland) Bill of 1958, 20 Clauses in 18 sittings and, a direct com parison, the Housing (Scotland) Bill of 1962, 37 Clauses in 22 sittings. We are now doing all we can to co-operate on a 67-Clause Bill on the same subject in nine sittings. The Committee and the Government must take note of the fact that there is too much legislation going through this Committee, and that we are not having the opportunity to give it the scrutiny it ought to have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. G. D. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not only the Committee to which the Minister must pay attention. Each of the Bills that my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) has mentioned affects local authorities. Local authorities have points they wish to make. They have to discuss them in their committees, pass them to us, and we have to discuss the points with them. At the rate at which the volume and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1149">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
bulk of legislation is now being put before this Committee, it is not possible to do that with the care that the importance of the legislation merits. I ask the Minister to bear that in mind. It is not good government to proceed like this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Steel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I accepted nomination to this Committee, I did not know that it was proposed to sit beyond Tuesday and Thursday mornings. I am a member of a Select Committee which meets on Tuesday afternoons. Therefore, I, like the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin), give notice that, to my great regret, I may not be able to attend all the meetings of this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Year after year in June and July the Scottish Committee always seems to be working frantically to get its business finished. I hope that in future years an effort will be made to start in October or November with far more frequent meetings of both the Grand Committee and its Standing Committees so that we do not find ourselves in this situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Dr. J. Dickson Mabon)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the point made by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith). We published the Bill on 5th February and we had the Second Reading on 18th and 20th March. Many of the 66 Amendments which I have tabled are the result of consultations with outside bodies. No hon. Member would want the Government to shut their minds to consultations with outside bodies until we start the Committee stage. I will indicate as we go along who suggested Amendments. I have never known a Committee stage to start without the Government having tabled some Amendments. It is evidence of their good will and second thoughts on some matters. But I accept that that is an added burden to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all have a list of Bills that we deeply regret are not being included in the Government's timetable, not because they are unacceptable to the Government, but because of lack of time. While one may protest that some Bills are not being dealt with, the number considered is an index of the productivity of hon. Members. There is no reason why we should not work as hard as people outside and be proud of the fact that we produce more good Bills than
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
some previous Parliaments have produced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I concede that some of the essential Bills mentioned by the hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) took rather longer than one would have wished, but one of the Bills he mentioned, the Local Government Finance (Scotland) Bill, was a Private Member's Bill and such Bills are usually either contentious or virtually go through on the nod. I cannot take responsibility for what happened on that occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to express deep appreciation to every member of the Committee for his co-operation. I am sorry that my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) has other commitments which prevent him from attending. I discussed members' commitments on other Committees and discovered that a number, including you, Mr. Robertson, were unable to be present on a Wednesday afternoon. As a Scottish Member, I realise how inconvenient Thursday afternoon is to most Scottish Members, and therefore we agreed that it would be reasonable to look at Tuesday afternoon as an alternative. I apologise to the hon. Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles (Mr. David Steel) for choosing a day on which he serves on another Committee, as does my hon. Friend the Member for Govan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a good Bill and on most of the issues we are agreed. The Amendments suggest that we shall be arguing not about principles, but about their application With good will and effort, we should achieve a good Bill in the time at our disposal. We should risk proceeding with Estimate debates and matter-day debates if we took a great deal of time with the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That during the proceedings on the Housing (Scotland) Bill the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursday at half-past Ten o'clock, and, with effect from Tuesday, 10th June, on Tuesdays at Four o'clock.</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the first Amendment, I remind the Committee that there is a Financial Resolution in connection with the Bill. Copies are available in the Committee Room. I should also like to draw the attention of the Committee to the fact that adequate notice of Amendments should be given. As a general rule I do not intend to call manuscript Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>GENERAL DUTY OF LOCAL AUTHORITY IN RESPECT OF HOUSES NOT MEETING TOLERABLE STANDARD.</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 1, in page 2, line 1, leave out subsection (2).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this Amendment we are to discuss Amendment No. 4, in page 2, line 9, leave out from "section" to end of line 10.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Both are probing Amendments. We should like the Government to give us some indication of how they see these subsections working. Under subsection (1) a duty is laid upon a local authority to close, demolish, or bring up to standard those houses which are now not up to a tolerable standard as defined in Clause 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2), to which my first Amendment relates, says that in carrying out their duty the local authority must, within such period as is reasonable, take account of the need for alternative accommodation. On Second Reading many Members expressed concern about the physical and human nature of the problem of housing people displaced while their own houses were being brought up to standard. It happens obviously where a house is demolished, but not so obviously where a house is to be improved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many instances have been given, for example in tenements, where in altering three houses in order to make two, not only has one to make sure that during the period of alteration and improvement the tenants in all three houses are found accommodation, but that after reconstruction the family of the third house is found accommodation elsewhere. Obviously, where there is demolition, or a family is displaced, accommodation of a more permanent nature has to be found. Where a local authority is concerned, it has an obligation to find accommodation for such people through its housing list.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What do the Government have in mind about temporary accommodation? Do they envisage that when an improvement is made, the tenants will be permanently rehoused and the improved property let or sold to new occupiers? Or are they look-
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
ing only for temporary accommodation to which the family may move while the improvements are being carried out?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For local authority tenants this will be a fairly straightforward matter, so long as the local authority shows the will to solve the problem. But difficulties will arise where a house is owned by a private landlord with private tenants. When occupiers own the property themselves, or are the private tenants of landlords, what help will the local authority give when it is necessary to find alternative accommodation for them?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Report of the Sub-Committee of the Scottish Housing Advisory Committee on the allocating of council houses, published in 1967, particular emphasis was laid on the need for local authorities, when drawing up the housing list, to pay increasing attention to the problems of families displaced because of demolition or improvement to old property. It might be interesting to hear what progress has been made by local authorities since that recommendation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 4 refers to subsection (3). I should like to know exactly what is the intention of the words I propose to leave out. Under subsection (3) the local authority shall make a survey
	<br><blockquote><p>"for the purpose of ascertaining the availability of alternative housing accommodation."</p></blockquote>
Local authorities are in a good position to know precisely the alternative accommodation with the own housing and what their overall housing position is, but what steps does the Minister of State imagine a local authority will take to examine alternative accommodation in the private housing sector? It would be interesting to know precisely what steps they will be taking and what use the Government imagine local authorities will make of the private housing sector in making sure that alternative accommodation is available for those who have to be rehoused.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are probing Amendments, but rehousing after the demolition of or during improvement to property is a practical and human problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I support the probing conducted so ably by my hon. Friend the Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith)? No one could ever be satisfied with the pace of slum clearance, however rapidly it may proceed. Subsection (2) highlights the most
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1151">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
outstanding limiting factor, namely, the provision of alternative accommodation for those displaced. This is the one critical factor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Edinburgh, I understand, the difficulty is not so much finance as finding a sufficient building force to provide the necessary alternative houses. This is the crucial point. I wonder whether the Minister can tell us whether this applies to other parts of Scotland, Glasgow, for instance, and whether it is the shortage of manpower in the building industry to put up the new houses needed to rehouse those displaced which is the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Likewise, one must bear in mind that the occupation of houses which are being put up by corporations throughout the country is of some importance as well. If we are to provide accommodation for those displaced, it is necessary to see that the maximum amount of encouragement is given to those now living in council houses to provide their own accommodation wherever possible. We should then be able to relieve this terrible pressure within the slums for better accommodation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in what the Minister says. Subsection (2) states that the local authority shall have regard to
	<br><blockquote><p>"…. alternative housing accommodation likely to be available for any persons who may be displaced from houses as a result of any action proposed by the local authority in pursuance of …"</p></blockquote>
subsection (1).

I am a bit concerned about the line being taken by hon. Members opposite here, because it seems to suppose that, as usual, every request for accommodation will come back to the local authority. This can be the wrong start to this kind of Bill, because this is precisely one of the difficulties that most local authorities have had in trying to get the private owners to make some kind of provision for those whom they are displacing if they are modernising or rehabilitating property. The easiest thing is obviously to say to the local authority that in a close of twelve houses, four are to be knocked away, so will the local authority accept responsibility for re-housing these four tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fair enough—this is where there could be some degree of understanding and compromise, but it is grossly unfair to put all the responsibility on a local authority when
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
the private factors do not even operate a waiting list—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree wholeheartedly with what the hon. Member is saying, but it is equally important that as much encouragement as possible should be given for private house owners who let their buildings to be able to run an economic business by so doing. This is where I think that later parts of the Bill will be very valuable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We should not argue the economics of housing at this stage, because I assume a situation in which private factors operate either as individual landlords or a company. Where they have a block or a group of properties within their control, it does not seem to me unreasonable that we should start by saying that there is some obligation on them to try and rehouse people who are displaced from their property or the property that they are factoring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If they have a vacant house somewhere else, presumably it has become decontrolled because of its being vacant, so they can charge what they like consistent with what the rent officer will let them get away with. I do not think, therefore, that we should enter into the economic argument. I merely suggest to the Minister that it is wrong: to think that only the local authority should be obliged to have some regard to the availability of housing accommodation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just one point which has not been touched upon so far, and which has been in my mind for some time. We are concerned of course with the local authorities' function in building new houses, and in rehabilitating old houses. But is that the only demand which is placed on our new and our rehabilitated housing supply? There are other developments at the same time going on, which are making a drain on the new housing supply. There are industrial developments taking place under our noses, and I am wondering what is the impact of that type of development on our new housing supply and how it is being met and does it come within the competence of this particular measure to face up to that particular impact on the housing supply which we are creating to deal principally with the old sore that has afflicted many parts of Scotland for far too long?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1152">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The noble Lord the Member for Edinburgh, North (Earl of Dalkeith) asked me what was preventing an even greater number of houses being built than at the present time, when we have record figures. One wants to look at that matter in terms of four serious factors. Land is an additional factor, but that is a matter of planning, and the rest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first factor is money. While the subsidies have been improved considerably, there are still strains on the Exchequer and on local authorities to finance these programmes, though not as substantial as was the case some time ago. But I think that we are getting near the right figure for the allocation of money for expenditure on housing that we have authorised so far. Some may say, "Not enough". If so, I am glad: I would prefer that to people saying "Too much". One public expenditure which we ought not to cut is housing. That is exemplified by this discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second factor is manpower. To some extent it is true that we cannot build houses in the old style with the present labour force. Therefore, we have adopted industrialised building. To date, 33 per cent., or even a higher percentage of all new houses approved by the Department are built by industrialised methods. That is not only an economy of labour but can be an economy of time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third factor is materials. We have largely overcome difficulties here, although from time to time we do have shortages of this item and that item. That is a matter of organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fourth factor is method. Within method, I would argue that there must be sense of purpose. Even a good authority with a good sense of purpose cannot achieve all that it wants to achieve if it has bad methods. Conversely, too, the best organised authority which does not have a sense of purpose will not be able to achieve a high programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make this last point particularly, because if we took away subsection (2), we would make a nonsense of subsection (1). That would not apply in every case, I quite agree, but subsection (1) would be given a meaning of comprehensiveness and immediacy that in many cases would be absurd. It would mean that whenever we did a survey we would promptly have to rehouse everybody in houses that were to be demolished, or switch them out into
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
temporary accommodation in order to improve the accommodation. That is clearly absurd.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me give the Scottish figures. In Scotland just now we estimate that the percentage of houses falling below the tolerable standard is 15 per cent., or a quarter of a million houses. If we take the hon. Gentleman's constituency, the figure in Kincardine is 18 per cent., and in North Angus and Mearns it is 20 per cent. That shows that it is not just in the burghs where the critical problems arise. By the way, those figures are not only for the counties of Angus and Kincardine but for the burghs which are within them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One can add the fact that in the small county of Kincardine the waiting list is 800. In Kincardine, for all kinds of reasons, 800 families are waiting for a house, and yet there are in Kincardine 1,400 houses that are already below the tolerable standard as we have defined it in this Clause. I could give figures for lots of other places in Scotland. I have instanced Kincardine deliberately, not so much because it is the hon. Gentleman's constituency as to show that there are rural areas or comparatively rural areas where these problems are quite serious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that these are probing Amendments, but to delete subsection (2) would make a nonsense of subsection (1) because we have to allow the local authority the opportunity of getting its plans ready. If we made this a rule, some people would work harder and try to stick to it, but what I think would happen is that the whole Clause would fall into disuse, because it would be so absurd and make such a demand on people. Therefore, I hope that the Amendment will not be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are already plenty of excuses for authorities refusing to declare houses unfit. In fact, the Cullingworth Report told us that many authorities were actually tempted by present legislation to refrain from declaring houses at present unfit simply because they could not rehouse the occupants. Hon. Members who have served in local authorities know that this is very true. In going around Scotland, I have discovered that the real facts of slumdom are obscured by the simple circumstance that no one dares to declare a house unfit unless he is able to put another house
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1153">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
at the disposal of the unfortunate family concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thus, the facts are not known.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During its periodic surveys of slums, the great city of Glasgow has made no attempt to tell us how many slums exist there. It simply gave the slums which it thought it could clear during the next ten years. I may add that often the definition of "slum-dom" is not good enough for the purposes of comparison between one area and another. I hope that the Bill will improve that situation, and that we shall get a closer assessment of the present position in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My remarks on the last part of the second Amendment, which seeks to strike out the words in subsection (3), and allied to what I have said on subsection (2), but I assure hon. Gentlemen that we need subsection (2), mainly for the reasons which I have given, and also because it strengthens the position of subsection (1). The overwhelming provision of alternative accommodation, whether temporary, as we have seen in Dunbarton and in Dundee, where people are moved out while the actual improvements are done—and it is interesting to note how many people who are moved out of these houses wish to return there following improvements—or permanent, has been done almost completely by the local authorities. This is something that we should encourage in the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember a case in Glasgow concerning 12 houses in Tollcross Road, owned by the Glasgow Property Owners' Association. The Association wished to move out the 12 families, after which it intended to improve the tenement and convert it to eight houses. The whole scheme broke down because, although the local authority was willing to help, it resented the fact that these eight houses were then to be put on the market for sale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another factor which upsets local authorities is that they do not wish to rehouse people from these private properties if the property is to be sold following improvements. They consider that the property owners have enough property at their disposal to be able to operate their own waiting list and their own decanting operations, whether of a temporary or permanent kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the Rent Act, 1965, which has been received fairly well both by landlords and tenants in Scotland, as well
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
as this legislation, will help us to get a better atmosphere for negotiation between local authorities and property owners. The property owners have their job to do, and I am afraid that in future they will have fewer excuses to put up for not being able to do the job. They must help the local authorities to improve houses in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister of State for answering some of the points I made. I may take it from what he said, as well as from historical experienc of rehousing in Scotland, that local authorities have been prepared to help private landlords with rehousing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this connection, I should like to refer to what was said by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Hugh D. Brown). Of course we want to see private landlords helping one another, and helping to rehouse as well. But the hon. Gentleman should also remember that what this Bill will require them to do will be at the behest of the local authority. We all want to see the standards of these houses raised, but we should remember that it will be for the local authority to require the landlords to do this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The local authority therefore has a responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I sincerely hope that where help is needed in rehousing, whether of a permanent or temporary nature, the local authority will be ready to give that help. Only in this way can we hope to carry out this programme of improvement with drive and with energy. There must be a co-operative effort between the public and private sector. I hope that the latter parts of this Bill, which will enable private landlords to obtain a more economic return on their cash outlay, will give them more incentive, where possible, to find alternative accommodation. This is an important point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept what the Minister of State said, particularly about the problem of bad housing. It is only fair to relate this to rural areas as well as to the more populated areas. Paragraph 68 of the Cullingworth Report, "Scotland's Older Houses", states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The enormity of the problem in Glasgow should not, however, obscure the very different but acute problem of unfit housing in rural areas."</p></blockquote>
It was found that in many rural areas conditions were just as bad as elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 69 points out that some of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1154">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
the problems in rural areas are greater than in the populated areas. It is right that the biggest concentration of the problem is in Glasgow and in some of the other industrial areas, but we should remember that however big the concentration of that problem is in the urban areas, the problem in the rural areas can be even more difficult of solution, although in magnitude it is not so great.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In relation to the figures quoted by the Minister of State for the counties which I represent, I ask him to remember the following sentence in paragraph 69 of the Cullingworth Report:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In some ways the problem in rural areas is more difficult of solution than that in urban areas, since it is frequently complicated by the economic difficulties of the area or the changing pattern of population distribution."</p></blockquote>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman, in relation to the figures which he quoted and to the very real problem facing local authorities in rural areas, will make sure that such help is available for them in solving their particular problem as exists in other areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State spoke of the growth in industrialised housing and of the growth of new housing in general. That is very interesting and important. But we should remember that many of the modern methods to which he referred are precisely those which are not applicable to housing improvement. Methods of clear-site demolition and rebuilding are important, but different building techniques and different types of firms are involved in improvement. The physical problems in terms of organisation and building technique are very different from those we have had to face so far in the new building housing problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was asked a question about how the new houses were being built. About one-third of the present force is used upon repairs and alterations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for saying that, since it is important to get the matter into perspective. We are not necessarily talking in the same terms about our improvement programme as we have talked so far about our new housing programme, important though that is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful for the reassurance given by the Minister. There was no intention, of course, of pressing Amendment No. 1,
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
and no intention of removing subsection (2). As the Minister of State said, that subsection is vital to the working of subsection (1). In view of the assurances given, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment by leave withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 2, in page 2, line 6, leave out "from time to time" and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"not later than 31st December, 1972 and at periods not exceeding 10 years thereafter."</p></blockquote>
Perhaps it would be convenient, Mr. Robertson, to take also Amendment No. 5, in line 10, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"Such a survey together with proposals for tackling the problems revealed shall be submitted to the Secretary of State and shall be published by the local authority."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The two Amendments give effect to a suggestion that I made during Second Reading. Although I accept that we must leave subsections (1) and (2) fairly fluid, I do not think that this should necessarily apply to subsection (3). As the Minister of State knows better than anybody, and as he has just indicated in his previous reply, the performance and the standard of energy and determination of local authorities to clear unfit houses vary between one part of the country and another. It varies between city and city, between large burgh and large burgh, between small burgh and small burgh and between county and county. If we leave the Bill as it stands, we will not materially do sufficient to prod the laggard local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As subsection (3) now reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Every local authority shall from time to time cause to be made such a survey or inspection … as may be necessary for the performance of the duty."</p></blockquote>
What does "from time to time" mean? This is a bolthole through which the more lackadaisical authorities will escape. It means nothing. There should be a requirement that the first such survey should be made by the end of 1972. It should be done within the next three years, and this should be required of every local authority. After that, they should be required to resurvey their areas not less frequently than at ten-year intervals. That is my first proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, once the survey has been made, what is to be done with it? Are we to ensure that sufficient action is taken, or is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1155">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
it to be a paper survey which will require the Minister of State to ask local authorities what they propose to do? I should like to see a specific provision that they should have to submit to the Secretary of State proposals based on the survey, plans for remedying the situation the survey has revealed. I see no reason why, in the interests of the community as a whole, these plans and these proposals should not be made public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that these two exploratory Amendments will receive consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Wolrige-Gordon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think it right from time to time to say a word for the Liberal Party. The Liberals' boat is still afloat on the party political fringe; why not give them a wave?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment requires serious attention from the Minister. Obviously, he will reply that local authorities already do this from time to time to some extent. Much of this part of the Bill will depend on a fairly liberal interpretation by the relevant authorities, and he may say that we do not want to infringe on their freedom of action in a matter of this kind. It is equally obvious that where they will do this job, they will already be doing it regularly. An exercise of the kind the hon. Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles (Mr. David Steel) has in mind would be of value only if there were machinery to keep it constantly up to date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be argued that the Amendment would not interfere with the freedom of action of those local authorities which are already on the ball, but, as it is certainly possible that not all of them are and not all of them necessarily will be anxious to be when the time comes, the Amendment merits consideration by the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see the force of the argument advanced by the hon. Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles (Mr. David Steel), supported on this occasion by a rather strange ally, the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. Wolrige-Gordon). Before the boat becomes too uncomfortable, may I say that the Amendment would be a little too rigid? I have strong objections to a period of ten years. The general practice of good authorities is to survey more frequently. If one introduced a figure, it would tend to become the norm of practice, and this would be a retrograde step.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
I realise that that is not what the hon. Member wants. He wants a regular review. Regular reviews depend on the situation, and to some extent on the political complexion of the authority and its personalities. It depends on how earnest they are in trying to get things done. We should not circumscribe the position of the authorities by giving them definite intervals at which to make the surveys. This is a matter which they should be keeping constantly under review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to beginning by 31st December, 1972; most authorities should have made surveys by now. To the best of my knowledge, most have. There is no particular sanction in having a formal date for beginning. I accept that we should have close relationships between the Department and each authority. We should encourage authorities, by administrative guidance, to promote these surveys and carry out this work more energetically. If they do not do that and this is something that we have not done so far it is high time the Secretary of State began to use his default powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that there is a single instance of our having done this, but we should give notice to those authorities who have been laggard for so long that, with the passing of the Bill and the preceding legislation, we must insist that authorities stick to the spirit as well as the letter of housing legislation in matters of this kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 63 applies Section 201 of the consolidated Housing (Scotland) Act, 1966. In that application, the Secretary of State has power at any time to call for a report on the housing conditions in a local authority's district. This enables him to decide whether the authority has failed to exercise any of its powers or to carry out any of its duties under the Housing Acts. If there is such a failure, he may then exercise his default powers under Section 193 of the Housing (Scotland) Act, 1966, and under Section 356 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act, 1947. If it came to this, the Secretary of State would then be enabled to take over a local authority's specific duties; or he could get an order from the court of session requiring it to carry out its duties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are substantial steam hammers, but perhaps in the past we have regarded them as being too fierce ever to be used. Having been round most of the housing authorities in Scotland, I am surprised by
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1156">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
the indolence of some of them, and by the fact that most councillors and their Members of Parliament have not been aware of the laggardly administrations in their areas, or have failed to protest in public, in the council chamber or in Parliament, about it. I am not making a party point here. This affects hon. Members irrespective of party. It is one of the duties of an hon. Member to know what is going on in his own constituency in relation to the housing proposals and, if necessary, to get into trouble with his own authority, as I do regularly, if it is not building as many houses as it should.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Adam Hunter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would not my hon. Friend agree that this is partly due to the shortage of suitably qualified staff in sanitary inspectors' departments in many areas in Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with that to some extent, but there are many excuses given by authorities for not doing these things. The excuse we have just heard is partly true, that is about rural authorities, elderly people not wanting to move and so on. That is no reason why slumdom exists in so many counties of Scotland. Dumfries is an example of a county that will not clear its slums for 12 years, yet it is not short of a sanitary inspector—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not mean that it had anything to do with the hon. Member.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following our spirit of cooperation, I am astonished by that attack. Surely the Minister knows that Dumfries has the best slum clearance record of any town in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry. I meant Dumfriesshire. If I said Dumfries, I am sorry. I meant Dumfriesshire. Dumfries Burgh, thanks to good conveners in the past, of whom George Douglas is perhaps one of the most outstanding, and I will not name his political allegiance, is a very good burgh in that regard. But I was speaking about rural counties in this context and Dumfriesshire on the last visit I paid told me that it would not sweep away its slums for twelve years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have constantly told the small burghs and counties of Scotland that it would be marvellous for them to be able to say to any incomer or visitor, "We are a place
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
in Scotland totally free of slums." What a marvellous claim that would be. In Aberdeenshire, for example, we had a difficult situation with rural slums and it is only because of the resolution of the difficulties over the supply of water that the county is now able to go ahead with a good sized housing programme that will wipe out the rural slums in far less than 12 years. That is, of course, if it is not caught up by the Bill, for the Bill will raise the standards of housing assessment so that many so-called sub-standard houses, not slums, will now be classed as slums.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Clause 2 we start to lay down conditions that will knock out a lot of houses from the present sub-standard category into the slum category. That means that slum lists will enlarge. It all depends on the situation, on the attitude of local councils and of Members of Parliament and, I admit, in the last analysis on the Secretary of State's office. We should be willing more actively to intervene and be unpopular. I accept that. If necessary, we should use these default powers rather than leave them as a rusty mechanism which has never been used, as far as I am aware, by any Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have much sympathy with the idea, suggested by Amendment No. 5, of publishing the list. Local authorities ought to publish their lists, but I would not make it statutory, because I would not give them another excuse for failing to carry out the survey. When a survey is done, it must come from the sanitary department or the town clerk's office—whatever the arrangement is—to the individual councillors on the housing committee. They must see it. There cannot be just one copy. Councillors on the committee and perhaps even the whole council in session must see it. There is no reason why that list should not be handed to a local newspaper and published. There would be no expense to the ratepayer and it would be of great interest to local readers to know what the survey showed. That would mean that no councillor would have the alibi of saying, "We cannot publish another book at a cost of £300, or £500, or £1,000 to the ratepayers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So, while I agree with the hon. Gentleman in this, I do not want it put into the Bill, because I feel that it would be used as another excuse not to carry out these surveys. As we are not laying down a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1157">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
regular interval and as I have suggested that the Scottish Office ought to intervene more directly when surveys are not being made, I think that the hon. Gentleman will see the line of my argument: his Amendment is designed to improve the Bill, but in this strategy it could actually hinder the very object he is seeking. We are agreed on the principle, as is the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, East.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is there any obligation on a local authority to advise an individual that it has agreed that a house is not up to a tolerable standard? When a man from a council calls at a house to inspect it, everybody automatically thinks that tomorrow something is to happen about it. Has there been any indication of the attitude of most local authorities? If we do not make some statutory provision, will authorities advise people that they are only looking at a house to classify it and that there will be a time lag?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a matter of public relations. The sanitary department ought to make it clear that it is carrying out a survey. I am touched by the idea that when somebody from the council calls, it is thought that something is to be done tomorrow. No doubt that has been usual in Glasgow in the last decade or so, but it is not the common experience of most ratepayers in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will come later to what they do in relation to improvements, but I understand by hon. Friend's point which is how one is to make sure that people know that it is a survey and not the actual proposal. This is something the sanitary department has to make clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said earlier, we want to approach the Bill in a sense of sweet co-operation, and certainly some of the points the Minister has made have touched on some of the points I wish to raise later. In that sense of co-operation, I shall save my comments till then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In order to move speedily when that time comes, may I now say a few words about the general points this debate has raised? I must confess that if the Minister of State is looking for our co-operation, he must be careful to hedge his remarks about different local authorities by saying that they are made regardless of political colour and regardless of what hon. Members represent them. Whenever he has
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
somebody to castigate, he is careful to select a local authority at an area which is represented by an Opposition Member.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gregor Mackenzie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the hon. Member remembers that on Second Reading my hon Friend paid considerable compliment to Dumfries, the constituency represented by the hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, and we hope that this spirit of good will may continue in Committee so that we get a balanced and not a one-sided picture of the whole of Scotland. The Minister of State will merely inspire hon. Members to talk about their own local authority areas and defend them if he continues in the spirit of his speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles was right to move the Amendment. In Chapter 8, "A Comprehensive Housing Plan", of its Report the Cullingworth Committee recommended that the Secretary of State should play a more positive role in making sure that local authorities carried out duties laid upon them to bring housing to a higher standard. At the same time the Committee said that there was such a wide variation of problems, such a different standard of priorities in different areas, in accordance with the problems, that it was difficult to lay down a precise and accurate timetable for local authorities to follow. To that extent, while there are many attractions in the Amendment, it may not be appropriate to the actual circumstances and the wide variation of problems across Scotland.

The Minister of State has answered many of the questions that I wanted to ask, particularly whether he was satisfied with the workings of the 1966 Act and the reserve powers of the Secretary of State. I was slightly confused by what he said. He said that he did not want to use these reserve powers, yet he admitted that there might occasionally have been more drive. Does he mean that in the past there were occasions when the Secretary of State could and should have intervened? Is he saying that it is unnecessary to write new powers into the Bill, but that this is a warning of local authorities that in future in the improvement of housing standards, following the Cullingworth Report, he intends to take a much more positive role and to provide much more drive, and, if need be, the stick? It would be useful not

only to hon. Members but to local authorities in Scotland to know precisely what kind of rôle the Secretary of State intends to act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that I tabled these two probing Amendments, because what has emerged from this debate has been extremely useful. I have been relieved to hear the Minister's reply. He was right particularly to refer to the interest which members of Parliament ought to take in housing conditions within their constituencies. He will understand that there is a considerable difference between a Member of Parliament, like himself, who has a relationship with one housing authority and a Member of Parliament, like myself, who has 11 housing authorities in his constituency, no two of whom have the same housing policies on any matters as far as I can discover. There is a difference here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the reasons for my general concern about this aspect of the Bill is that some time ago, because I was rather concerned about the policy of one of these 11 authorities—not in relation to unfit housing, but to another matter dealing with housing—I took the trouble to read up the independent reports that had been published on the matter, together with the Scottish Office's advice, and found that they both coincided with my views and criticisms of the local authority's practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wrote to the local authority concerned drawing its attention to this fact, and indicated that I wished it to look at the matter again. I got a letter from the clerk of the council saying that the council was not particularly interested in my views or, indeed, those of the Scottish Office. It was a saddening experience. It is for this reason that I feel that housing is such an important matter in relation to the lives of our constituents. It is not something in which we can afford to be pussyfooting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the Minister of State said about the possibility of the Secretary of State intervening more, or using a firmer lever on the local authorities, to me is very welcome indeed. The political differences from one local authority to another, is not a matter in which there is a wide variation of practice depending on the political complexion of the council. It depends on quite extraneous factors—the initiative of the members of councils, no matter what their political complexion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
In my part of the world, none of the councils is political, and yet the practice and the standard varies very much from one to another. It does not surprise me that the Minister of State is constantly criticising his local authority. This is part of the political scene in Greenock, and it would be surprising if he did not. Elsewhere, this is not the case. The healthy friction that may exist between a Member of Parliament and a local authority has nothing to do with politics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These two Amendments have served the purpose which I intended. I welcome the Minister of State's assurances, and feel that he has expressed views on how the local authority should proceed. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 3, in page 2, line 7, leave out "or inspection".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an exploratory Amendmeent. I do not intend to dwell too long on it, because when he replied to my Amendment No. 1, the Minister of State indicated that he would answer some of the points that I then raised. I look forward to hearing his remarks on this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I want to find out is why he uses the words "survey or inspection". What form will this survey or inspection take? It is interesting to note that under the 1966 Act, and under previous legislation, the word "inspection" only has been used. The use of the word "survey" is new, and I should like to know the reason for its use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What notice or warning will householders, landlords or occupiers have of such survey or inspection so that it can be properly carried out, and they are able to co-operate with the local authority in carrying out its duties?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the alternative use of a "survey" or an "inspection". Can we take it that they have exactly the same meaning, that they connote the same sort of activity or activities, and that there is no difference whatsoever in their meaning?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin), has put his finger on it. A survey could possibly be carried out without an inspection, based on previous information which the sanitary department has. An inspection,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1159">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
on the other hand, need not involve a complete survey. It is in order to cast the net wide that we use both words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman looks at Section 137 and then back at Section 4 of the 1966 Act, he will see references to "inspection" in Section 4 and to "the inspections and surveys" in Section 137. The words are used in previous Acts. They are meaningful in previous Acts and in this Bill. I suggest that we should leave them in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And they could not by any misconception be taken as alternatives? There is an argument there. One wants to be perfectly sure that they are crystal clear in their use and application.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was, of course, referring to Section 4 of the 1966 Act, which uses only the word "inspection". I appreciate that in the other Section there is the wider term, marrying them together for the first time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I certainly accept what the Minister of State says, but it would be helpful at this stage if he could answer my other point about what notice is available to householders, landlords or occupiers when an inspection is to take place. When an inspection is necessary, it is important to know the conditions. It is also necessary that we have the co-operation of those concerned, and co-operation is best obtained when proper notice is given. Whilst I am quite sure there is provision for this notice to be given, perhaps the Minister will refer to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry—I missed that point. Section 183(2) provides for 24 hours notice of the intention to enter any house.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister of State made a slightly rash invitation to Members of Parliament to be loud mouthed in their protests about matters which worry them. I should like to mention one especial worry which is particularly relevant to the point about providing alternative accommodation. I refer to the seemingly very slow pace of redevelopment of areas which have been cleared in the middle of city centres. There are very sizeable areas of Edinburgh, the St. James's Square area and the India
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
Place area, which are crying out for redevelopment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister rightly referred to people who have a very strong homing instinct: once they have been taken out of their houses they want to go back into those areas as soon as they can. It seems that we wait for an endlessly long time before anything is done about rebuilding these destroyed and obliterated areas. Very often we get the fringe areas, too, where there has been semi-clearance and where a large number of boarded-up houses are a potential fire risk. I have had specific cases adjacent to the St. James's Square area where this has occurred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of houses are inevitably destroyed in a general slum clearance programme which are possibly individually good for a number of years to come. The people who are pushed out of these houses naturally feel a good deal of resentment at being pushed out when there is a lapse of several years before redevelopment takes place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I am really getting up on my hind legs about is partly to protest about the apparently long delay which takes place, and to pose the question: is there any way in which Parliament can encourage local authorities to get on more rapidly with the job of redeveloping these very sizeable areas at a time when there is a desperate shortage of land, particularly in the centres of cities, where the great majority of people, particularly in Edinburgh, want to live?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not interpret the function of a Member of Parliament, after this Bill becomes law, as being loud-mouthed in complaining that his authority was not acting in accordance with the spirit and letter of this Bill or of previous Housing Acts. It is quite right that a Member of Parliament should make his position quite clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are deadly serious about this Bill. We are not promoting it in the fragile hope that one or two authorities might translate this provision into action, or might speed up improvements, or might clear away slums. We started recording slum clearance in 1955, and we do not have comprehensive figures before that date. If we take the period of the last four years, the average figure of slum clearance is 17,510 a year. Prior to that, it was 12,411 from 1955 to 1964 inclusive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1160">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
What is interesting is not just the averages which show the progress, but also the fact that we have risen from 10,546 in 1955 to 19,087 in 1967, and almost the same figure, 18,768, in 1968. Cullingworth looks looking to a figure of 25,000 to 30,000 slums being cleared each year in Scotland. At that pace we would get rid of most of our slum in a decade. It is that kind of pace that must be our aim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) does not like targets, but we are committing this Government and future Governments to that target, and a Government which falls short of that target is not serving Scotland well. We must get up to these figures of 25,000 and 30,000 a year as quickly as possible, in order to get rid of slumdom in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is, therefore, right and proper that if things are going well, if the average figures are turning out well for Scotland as a whole, and a Member of Parliament does not witness in his own area, that same progress, that Member should, in the first place, out of courtesy, go to his own authority, and understand the reasons for its problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The noble Lord spoke about St. James's Square. Obviously, he ought to see his own local authority. He obviously has more influence with his local authority than other hon. Members would have in Edinburgh, where they have a high regard for him, where the council is of the same political persuasion, where is known not to be loud-mouthed and difficult with the authority, but wanting to co-operate with it. He can say, "Why are you doing this?" or "Why are you doing that?".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are difficulties about planning and roads in that area—not just housing—and the noble Lord ought to be able to get reasonable answers. If answers are not reasonable, an hon. Member has the sanction of asking a Question in Parliament. While I know that every Secretary of State is reluctant to interfere in local authorities' affairs, it is high time that Members of Parliament brought the Secretary of State in more often as added force in a situation where a local authority will not act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, I am sorry that the hon. Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles (Mr. Steel) did not send us that letter which
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
sent "raspberries" to him and to the Scottish Office on that item, because I should have been delighted to have asked the authority what it meant by treating the Scottish Office's position so cavalierly. If it was a discussion on housing allocation, or something like that, I can rightly understand that attitude, because that is a matter of discretion for the local authority. But here we are talking about faults in relation to the carrying out of this Bill in relation to improvements, and that is a different matter from exercising discretion in a case of housing allocations, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say to the Committee that we are very serious about this Bill. We look to Members of Parliament, irrespective of party, to be our allies in seeing that any laggard authority is brought up to scratch. I say that quite genuinely. I am sorry that I earlier upset the hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro). I did put on record the high regard which Dumfries Burgh has in the eyes of the Scottish Office in relation to slum clearance and house-building, but that cannot be said of the county. It is true of other areas in Scotland that some parts of a constituency are very good and other parts, controlled often by the same party, are very bad. Therefore, it behoves Members of Parliament just as much as the Minister to assist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We get blamed on the Floor of the House for any fall in the numbers, hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) made a rousing speech in, I think, Crieff, denouncing this "socialist nightmare" for failing to build enough houses in the first quarter of this year. I have been busy trying to find all the authorities in Scotland that have let us down in the first quarter of this year. The hon. Gentlemen will be surprised, very surprised, if he sees the authorities that have let him down—let me down, for that matter, too, and also the Secretary of State, but that is another matter. I assure the noble Lord that we are very keen about the whole of this Bill, and I am very glad to have his support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is, I know, in a hurry to get this Bill through, and we accept that it is for very good reasons. That is why we are supporting him. But if he wants to get it through, it is no use making thoroughly unprovoked attacks on local authorities without any facts or figures in support and flying a kite, entirely of his own manufacture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1161">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
Since he raised this matter, I have had an opportunity to contact my local authority and to check on the position. I would like him to withdraw his condemnation of the Dumfries County Council, which has a thoroughly good record in the improvement of older houses in the area. We accept that in all local authority areas, particularly rural areas, there are older houses that need improvements. Many of these houses are occupied, perhaps, by retired farm workers who wish to live in the countryside and are reluctant to move into housing schemes so that their existing houses can be improved. This is quite understandable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These houses, which may rightly, in the Minister's regard, be considered as fit for improvement, are not, and the Sanitary Inspector assures me of this, grossly substandard, nor are they a health problem. So I think that the Minister is grossly exaggerating a situation which, though not perfect, is not so serious that he can accuse the County Council of dragging its feet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some three years ago the County Council gave him an assurance that all these houses would be improved within 12 years. The period is now down to nine years. I defy him to tell me all the local authorities, rural local authorities, in Scotland, which can definitely say that their houses will all be improved within nine years. All local authorities within their financial resources and my—the Government are certainly making it hard for them to have sufficient financial resources—are doing their very level best to improve houses, and I support them in what they are doing. But it is quite wrong for the Minister, in a Committee which is trying to be helpful and responsible and constructive, to make a quite unjustified attack on a local authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The remarks of the hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) are indicative of the kind of problem that we all face. My hon. Friend is perfectly capable of defending himself, but I remind the Committee that when he was speaking he was—very properly, in my view—directing attention to the lassitude or the lack of energy of local authorities generally. Until he came to the particular, most hon. Members seemed to assent. There were no outcries of protest when names were not used, so we all agree to the general principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend was quite right in directing the attention of the local authori-
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
ties to the need for initiative or energy. He said that the powers were there, and that it was the job of the local council, irrespective of party, to try and use them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, in adducing specific evidence my hon. Friend uses the names of one or two local authorities, it still remains true that those of us who represent Glasgow, the other cities and the rural areas have a responsibility. It is commendable to expect an hon. Member to come to the aid of his local authority, but there is a balance of view. The Committee should accept what my hon. Friend was saying. It is for him to provide the evidence which I do not have, but the general principle of what he was saying was the right attitude.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) that co-operation is needed. This is a good Bill, with good principles. Principles are all right, but they need active men and women to implement them. I hope that the hon. Member for Dumfries will not press this issue too far. If my hon. Friend was saying, and I do not think that he was—that Dumfriesshire did not intend to do anything about slum clearance for 12 years—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Question before the Committee is, "That the Clause stand part of the Bill", not whether Dumfriesshire, Lanarkshire or the City of Glasgow did or did not do something. Will the hon. Member address himself to the Clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought I was addressing myself to the argument adduced in favour of the Motion. If I am not allowed to reply to previous arguments which were permitted—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is one of the problems of a Chairman.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of what has been said, we ought to emphasise the purpose of the Clause. It imposes a general duty on any local authority, whether it operates in Dumfriesshire or anywhere else, in respect of houses not meeting a tolerable standard. My hon. Friend requires no defence.

Friend said that Dumfriesshire would take at least 12 years to reach the tolerable standard of housing laid down in the Clause. I agree that that is rather slow progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What has been said of Dumfriesshire is nothing to what I have said about Glasgow Corporation's application of housing standards to my constituency. It is the business of every hon. Member, particularly in Scottish areas where housing is in such a state, to use strong language to direct attention to that state.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A house should be the central feature in the life of every family. To occupy that position, it must match up to standards which only the local authority can ensure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have condemned the housing conditions in Govan in far more forceful language than my hon. Friend has applied to Dumfriesshire. I was rather surprised that the hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) should find himself in the position of having to oppose the Minister, who is seeking to establish good conditions, by appearing to support the existing state of housing affairs in Dumfriesshire which apparently do not match up to the standards we want in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gaibraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will learn from this unfortunate incident not to be specific.

I should like to pour oil on troubled waters. We want to make progress. The Minister should not make things difficult for us. He must look to the future. If he does not, he is bound to find that hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacKenzie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Hugh D. Brown) spoke of the uncertainty and the confusion that rumour caused when surveys were made. This ought to be looked at. My hon. Friend said on Second Reading that he intended to publish a manual, a guidance to local authorities. This is one of the things that he could take into consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my constituency we have had some housing improvements. Although people are cleared away from unsatisfactory houses, as the noble Lord the Member for Edinburgh, North (Earl of Dalkeith) rightly said, the majority want to come back. We all remember the example of the Port Glasgow experiment. If such a large scheme of clearance were carried out in my constituency, certainly two out of every three families would return to the central area that was being redeveloped.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past few weeks, however, much publicity has been given in the Press to families being moved, not out of old houses, but from the new high flats, and to the costs these families have had to bear. This seriously worries many people, and I hope that the manual of guidance will touch on this problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1163">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
We all know that these old areas are mainly tenanted by elderly people. The prospect of moving out temporarily, and then moving back, with the cost and inconvenience entailed, presents a serious problem and upsets the tenants. I hope that my hon. Friend will give guidance to local authorities about assistance in such cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanais-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Clause refers to the general duty of local authorities in respect of houses not meeting a tolerable standard. The Minister of State referred to different local authorities. I support my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro): we should avoid particularising for particularising of local authorities, with the contrasts drawn and the implications made, will impede our progress. This kind of issue could be raised time and time again, and I hope that we shall avoid further particularising.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Rutherglen (Mr. MacKenzie) asked an important question about alternative accommodation and rehousing, a matter which I have raised on the Floor of the House. I shall be interested in the Minister's reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a more general context, however, the Minister of State has said that we must try to move towards this target. He spoke of my dislike of targets. I dislike targets, unless we can be moderately certain of achieving them. Lack of achievement leads to mistrust and disrespect of politicians, and for that reason targets can be dangerous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to the Cullingworth Committee, we must achieve the figure of 25,000 to 30,000 houses a year being demolished in slum areas, and this is a target which we all want to be reached. But we should also remember the time-scale of this problem. The Minister of State said that we were now running at a rate of about 19,000 a year, well below what the Cullingworth Committee regarded as correct. For every year we fail to reach that target, we put further away the ultimate achievement of that target, for a backlog is added every year. There can be no simple time-scale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State took credit for the rate of slum clearance having increased so much in recent years. He compared the record under the present Administration with that of the previous Administration. Let him remember that we took the rate of slum clearance from just about nothing in 1951 to about 14,000 in 1964. Although
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
the Government have helped to carry on the momentum, we started it. The Minister should give us credit for our achievement if he makes that kind of comparison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am delighted that he reads my speeches, even though he is wrong about the places where I make them. I hope that he digests them and mends his ways as a result.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That concluding remark was just about the height of cheek. The speech to which I referred was a series of insults and abuse poured on the present Administration and had not a single supporting fact. I may have got the place wrong, but I certainly got the sentence right, namely, that targets were bad and that one ought not to have them. I disagree. Certain results cannot be achieved without a target. Falling short of a target is far better than having no target and making no improvement. This is one view to which we have been able to convert hon. Gentlemen opposite—although they may be less definite about their targets—that one should at least give people a sense of drive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last time I had a row with a Member of Parliament about the housing performance in his constituency was with the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur). I was glad when in the following years Perth's housing programme improved remarkably. I have no regrets that by this occurrence the hon. Gentleman and I managed to improve the housing position of the community in that city.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) will recall that we were debating the general question of demolition, for the Clause deals with demolition and improvement. I was not reflecting upon improvements, and I shall not comment on what the hon. Gentleman said on that subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to slum clearance. No Government can achieve a figure of 25,000 or 30,000 houses cleared a year unless individual authorities' totals bring the sum to that grand total. No Minister can afford to be mealy-mouthed about these things.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I go round many authorities and compliment them on their good work. Dumfries County is an excellent authority in many activities, but not in slum clearance. At the time of my visit I disagreed with the unfortunate statement that it was prepared to wait for 12 years to clear its then recorded slums. The county council is entitled to its own point of view, as I am to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1164">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
mine, but I think that 12 years is too long. After all, the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) agrees with us in Cullingworth style that the kind of target we should achieve is a 10-year programme of complete clearance. If we mean that, and if we are willing to quantify it as 25,000 or 30,000 houses cleared a year, we should be prepared as Ministers to go down the Scottish list and see the authorities with large accretions of slums rural as well as urban.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a general misconception in Scotland that the slums are in the cities and in the burghs. There are substantial slums in the rural counties. I gave the proportions as being higher than the Scottish average in some counties. I am sorry if people are sensitive and offended about that. I do not seek to blame people, but merely to point out that there is a problem that must be solved within a limited time-scale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad to tell my hon. Friend the Member for Rutherglen (Mr. MacKenzie) that Section 160 of the 1966 Act allows local authorities to pay removal expenses at their discretion and depending on individual circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am obliged to my hon. Friends for their support of my views about making comments. I do not wish to act upon the advice not to be specific. I admit that my own authority was not perfect, and it was not perfect when it was run by the Labour Party. It is wrong for a Member of Parliament to boast about his own authority when it is controlled by his own party, and criticise it if it is controlled by another party. It is also wrong for a Member of Parliament, if he has two authorities in his area, to praise the good and keep silent about the bad. He should denounce the bad. The hon. Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles (Mr. David Steel) has a difficult job, for the majority of his authorities have only recently been pulling up their socks and have still a way to go.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So while I am prepared to take advice about how I should handle the Bill in Committee, I hope that hon. Members will not ask me, as the Minister, to be mealy mouthed about circumstances and not to tell the truth. As the Irishman said, "If you stop telling lies about me, I will stop telling the truth about you." Surely it is terrible to say to a Minister, "You will not get your Bill if you dare tell the truth,
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
if you are indiscreet about what is not being done here and there."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is supposed to be a joint party exercise, welcomed by all as a new page in Scottish history. Let us not smudge it; let us write it clearly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister does not take my advice, if he is specific and criticises hon. Members' constituencies, or local authorities, where there may be extenuating circumstances which an hon.

I know how the Minister likes to justify everything he does, but I hope that he will not make these attacks in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>DEFINITION OF HOUSE MEETING TOLERABLE STANDARD.</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Clark Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 6, in page 2, line 19, at end add
	<br><blockquote><p>"with secure and weatherproof roof and properly functioning weatherproof windows."</p></blockquote>
I have moved the Amendment because I am not certain what the words "structurally stable" mean. In the Clause the Government draftsmen have been detailed. Normally, I am not in favour of tying things up too tightly in a Statute, or being too specific, or detailed, but in this case the Government have seen fit to be accurate and explanatory and I do not necessarily say they are wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But it has been my experience that difficulties and complaints about housing, whether old or new, centre around roofs and windows more than any other items. I have also noted the validity of these complaints after personal inspection. The word "structure" indicates to me walls and foundations rather than anything else. I have consulted the dictionaries, and although not entirely helpful, they tend to substantiate my contention. It is possible that a roof may be regarded as structure, but it is unlikely that windows come under this term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the sake of clarity, and because of my personal experience and observations, I hope that the Government will agree to the Amendment. It is important and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1165">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
specific and I think that it will strengthen the Bill. It will benefit future and present residents in the flats and houses concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise again with some trepidation to support the Amendment. I have probably had more experience of slum property and tenements than most other members of the Committee. Only last week I had constituents going to court for the non-payment of rates. They had refused to pay them because there were holes in their roof which were not being repaired, with the result that the repair bill would mount up over the years. However, the building was structurally sound.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had another constituent who had complained of water pouring into his house ever since January, 1968, and nothing had been done about it. When I looked at the building, I found the water was coming in as a result of storm damage. On 16th May, 1969, I received a letter saying that the building was to be repaired—nearly 18 months after it had been damaged. But the building was structurally sound in the meanings that I know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could give many more illustrations. For instance, I had been called in by constituents to houses where the windows were ready to fall out. The landlord would not repair the windows. Indeed, there have been many deaths among window cleaners resulting from this type of non-repair. I believe the Amendment is worth the Minister's consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a sensible Amendment in that it draws attention to the importance of these defects. Their effect is either serious or minor. If minor, they should not be disregarded but would be dealt with under Clause 25, which gives a new power which we are taking as a consequence of our experiences of storm damage. A good example was given by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Central (Mr. Tom McMillan), of where Part II would operate to correct the lesser form of these defects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there were substantial defects, that is to say, those which are the cause of penetrating damp, and obviously the consequence of the roof not being weather proof, resulting in a constant leakage, the house could not pass item (1) (	<i>b</i>). If the windows were so bad that they did not function properly, indicating a major defect in them, they would not pass item (1) (c).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
While these are good suggestions, nevertheless, if defects are minor, they ought to be tackled under Part II of the Bill and if they are major they are already covered by subsection (1) (	<i>b</i>) and (	<i>c</i>). We should not go further, because there are defects in wording and meanings in all kinds of phrases as the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) described. His Amendment, as I understand it, draws attention to what is meant rather than what it is legally implied. Paras (	<i>b</i>) and (	<i>c</i>) provide for a house to be brought up to tolerable standards and if the defects are of a minor character, Clause 25 and the succeeding Clauses of Part II would rectify the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a sensible point to raise, but it is already within the scope of the Bill and I hope that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South will be content with that explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clark Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the Minister to the extent that the question of the roof might be covered by subsection (1) (	<i>b</i>) in that if it had a leak, it could be called "penetrating damp". But I am not sure about his explanation of paragraph (c). It is windows that do not work which interest me, and paragraph (	<i>c</i>) talks about natural and artificial lighting for ventilation. It is unwanted ventilation that concerns me. Perhaps the Minister would explain this more fully.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alex Eadie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not intend to intervene, because I thought that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) had a point in drawing the Committee's attention to a discrepancy in the wording of this provision. I agree with him … that the explanation that the Minister has given has really been unsatisfactory. The Minister should not take umbrage at this remark, because he was very quick to point out that this Bill was supposed to be a joint collective operation between the Government and the Opposition. Therefore, if we are inclined to agree with some of the suggestions made during the course of debate by hon. Members opposite for the strengthening of the Bill, that should not surprise the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My own local authority made a comment which though not similar to that made by the hon. Gentleman the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison), had the same sense. My local
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1166">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
authority said that a house which is "structurally stable" is one that is not in a state in which it will fall down, but it may be in a state of disrepair. The words "repair" and "disrepair" do not appear in this Clause and this seems to be an important omission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That puts in another form the point which the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South was trying to make. I therefore wanted to hear the Minister's explanation. He might have said that he would have another look at the point, and think about it again. I was a bit surprised when he said, that it was thought to be already covered. The comment I have referred to is made by an expert in this particular field. He has examined the Bill, and has informed me that he is dissatisfied with this wording.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend will consider the point made by the hon. Gentleman the Member for Edinburgh, South, and, if he is not prepared to accept the precise wording, will have another look at the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The words "repair" and "disrepair" do not occur here, because they occur in Part II. This was the point that I was trying to make. We are talking here about the tolerable standard, not about disrepair. If the house is in disrepair take measures in Part II to deal with it. In other words, if the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) is arguing that a house should not be held to be not in a tolerable standard simply because it is out of repair, the answer is, to put it into repair. But it may not be possible to put the house into complete repair. It may have to be positively improved. It may be impossible for a house below the tolerable standard to be repaired or improved, in which case it can be demolished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point is that the hon. Gentleman must divide his assessment into two parts. If the roof is leaking it can be repaired, but if it is leaking so badly that it is considered to be causing damp, the question is whether it can be restored or improved, or whether it should be demolished. That question is determined quite freely. Under paragraph (	<i>b</i>), it would be termed "penetrating damp", but it might be more than penetrating damp. In some cases it could be a waterfall. Still, that is penetrating
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
damp, even though these words sound rather modest when some of us know of the conditions which the hon. Gentleman is trying to bring to our attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He has a point about properly functioning weatherproof windows, but again I ask him to divide his assessment. If the window is not functioning because it is in a state of disrepair, under Part II it can be restored. If it cannot be repaired, if it needs a substantial improvement or conversion, it would fail under (c) because there can be excessive ventilation. That is what he is trying to say, but that would render the house being not up to a tolerable standard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not accept the definition that a house is structurally stable only because it will not fall down, I, too, have a lot of legal advice at my command, and I do not accept that interpretation. It may be one version, but it is certainly not a version that I could accept.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eadie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make it clear that I was not giving a legal definition. I was giving the definition of a responsible professional man. I should like it to be recorded that I was not giving a legal definition in itself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad about that. I am a responsible professional man, I like to think, as a doctor, but I could not possibly give a legal opinion without taking advice from professional competent lawyers on the legal meanings of things. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) and I regularly get into trouble together by often wanting to achieve something which in our words is not legally the same thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to listen to the lawyers on the meaning of words imported into statutes, so that what we mean in our ordinary everyday language is meant in the Statute as well. I counsel every one to remember that words which they seek to put down do not necessarily reflect themselves in practice in Statute. I accept the essence of what the hon. Gentleman for Edinburgh, South says. If the roof is so bad and cannot be repaired, and if the windows are so bad and cannot be repaired, the house falls out with the tolerable standard, I am advised, under (	<i>b</i>) and (	<i>c</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If they can be repaired, and that is put up to the owner, under Part II they must be repaired. If the owner does not repair them—we will debate this in Clause 25—the local authority can step in and do the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1167">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
work. In that case, the house is brought to a tolerable standard simply by carrying out the repairs. I hope that with that assurance the hon. Gentleman will take my point. I agree with him, but I do not think that we have to import this particular phrase into the conditions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) has a very valid point when he speaks of weatherproof windows, particularly in absolutely brand-new houses. Very few people will think about new houses in that context, but one gets a great many criticisms from people who move into new houses that one of the chief troubles is badly fitting windows, or windows which, within a matter of months of occupation, warp and cease to be weatherproof.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clark Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of what the Minister has said, and his technical points, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 7, in page 2, line 25, leave out "both hot and cold".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this Amendment we can take Amendment No. 9, in line 26, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"and adequate facilities for heating water."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Blowing both hot and cold is precisely what the Committee seems to have been doing this morning. I hesitate to taking the Committee from the roofs of my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) down to the plumbing. But, as we all know, plumbing is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to know from the Minister of State what precisely is meant by a supply of hot water. For the standard of a house to be tolerable must there be a full hot water system such as one may get, for example, in a new house? Or, and this is the purpose of the Amendment, will a house be considered to be up to a tolerable standard merely if the means are there for heating the water?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some of our older houses, installing a complete hot water system—involving structural alterations, putting holes through walls, and all the rest of it—can become a very expensive business. With other means of heating water—and here we are practical in getting down to all the details of the plumbing—it is entirely practicable, for example, to put a geyser type of appliance or a water heater above a sink, above a wash hand basin, or even above a bath. That can be, from the capital point of view, a very much simpler operation, and one not involving structural alterations. I believe, from houses I have seen and people I have spoken to, that there can be provided, perhaps not an ideal source of hot water supply, but a very adequate form of hot water supply. The purpose of the Amendment is to ask the Minister whether one must have a complete hot water system, or whether, if there are facilities for heating the water and hot water is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1168">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
available if needed, house would be considered adequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an important point. It is a point of principle. We have to be clear where we are on these standards. Let us remember that whether a house is likely to have a demolition order put on it, or allowed to be repaired, may depend on the fulfilment of one of these subsections. We must be clear exactly what the subsections mean, because the future of the house may depend on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clarity is also important because when we come to Clause 45 we find that a landlord, when applying for a qualifying certificate for rent, has also to make sure that the house satisfies these tolerable standards. Equally, we must be quite clear just what these standards are, because when a landlord serves a notice on a tenant that he intends to apply for a qualifying certificate for an increase in rent, he and the tenant may have different interpretations on what that tolerable standard is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a point of principle involved here, and the Amendment illustrates the point of principle more clearly than could otherwise be done. There is a world of difference between a complete hot water system in a house and the mere provision for heating water in a proper modern way at a sink, or a bath, or wherever it may be needed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope my hon. Friend will be careful when considering the Amendment. I do not follow the hon. Gentleman when he talks of hot water systems in a house. We are talking about houses which do not meet these requirements. Few of the houses I have in mind would meet all these requirements, and particularly the requirements of a hot water system. It is possible that in many of the single ends, as we know them in Glasgow, there may be a hot water supply through a gas pipe or something of that kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is for the Minister to answer, but I should think, as was said in Second Reading, that Part I, and particularly this Clause, lays down the standards of tolerability. My hon. Friend the Secretary of State said: "Unlike the present provisions about unfitness, which simply list a number of factors which have to be taken into account, but can be ignored, the new standard "—that is as laid down here, one of which is the hot water system: "lists a
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
number of tests, worded as positively and precisely as possible."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Scottish Grand Committee,</i> 18th March, 1969; c. 9.] If the hon. Gentleman is seeking further precision, I can go along with him, but if he is asking in these houses standards which might deprive the local authority of the right to take down houses within an area—because there might be a set of houses which would comply with a higher standard than would others—that would deprive the local Authority of the right to tackle housing treatment areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While bearing in mind the point that the hon. Member has made about this, I would ask my hon. Friend to consider what might happen to a whole area if it is to be treated as an area with houses for demolition, some of which can be demolished, some of which can be retained, or a combination of both. We have to watch that we do not leave the local authority handicapped in overcoming the main problem of this Part of the Bill, which is to get rid of slums.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) has raised a useful point. It was my understanding that the Bill, as drafted, would cover the existence of a gas or electric water heater at a sink. If I am wrong about that I should like to be corrected. I do not think that his proposed solution in Amendment No. 9 should be accepted. If it were, I imagine that the existence of a gas stove and a pan would be adequate facilities for heating water, I do not think that that is the sort of standard that he intends to be acceptable. The hon. Gentleman has raised an interesting point, but I do not think that his Amendment meets it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Rutherglen (Mr. MacKenzie) indicates that he wishes to underline the point made by the hon. Gentleman the Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles (Mr. Steel) which was, to some extent, the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Hannan) touched on. The difference between the Bill and the Amendment is that the Bill—and we gave a great deal of thought to this, and a party of officials representing the local authority associations gave a great deal of thought to it as well, and made a recommendation to Ministers—concentrates on the supply of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1169">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
water. The Amendment concentrates on the facilities. I should like the Committee to think of the difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that it is very difficult to get exactly what we want here. What the Government mean here is that we should have a proper supply of hot water from a tap at the sink. If we proceeded to spell it out in the form of facilities, we might find that some dubious landlords, of whom there are, unfortunately, still a minority, would, if they knew an inspection was coming along, put up a temporary heater, and claim that they had adequate facilities. To be really absurd about it, one could even argue that a pan or a kettle—and, by the way, I think that these would pass—were adequate facilities, together, of course, with the means of heating the water in the kettle or the pan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Concentrating on the facilities is, therefore, a serious error, and what we have to do is to concentrate on the supply. After all, the judgment made by the inspector is based on the fact that the house has to have a sink, and into that sink a satisfactory supply of cold and hot water.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The sink in the house?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The sink in the house, yes. The sink in the house will have a supply of cold water, which is what the Amendment would leave. The word "supply" is still there—"a satisfactory supply". The reference to "hot" would be taken out, and the "hot" would be conditional on appliances, or rather on facilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But would it be all right if the hot water came out of a geyser rather than from a boiler system heated by the range?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. If the inspector considered that that was a satisfactory means of giving a flow of water which was reliable, permanent and satisfactory in his judgment, that would qualify. It is to remove any question of inadequacy of facility or impermanence of facility that we are using this phrasing. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles (Mr. David Steel) for emphasising that. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree that it is better to leave the definition as it stands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. There is no intention in any way to lower the standard, or to make it
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
easier to get away with a lower standard. The Amendment may achieve its purpose in that it is now clear—and the Minister is satisfied that in legal terms it is correct—that the water supply may be a supply of hot water to the sink through a geyser, or some such means of heating, and there does not necessarily have to be some whole house system for heating hot water. I am prepared to accept what the Minister has said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I moved the Amendment to get the position clarified. We have achieved that. If the position were not absolutely and completely clear, it would be open to dispute and would hinder the purpose of the Bill.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 10, in page 2, line 27, leave out "for the exclusive use of the occupants of the house".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Amendment is not intended to change the meaning of the Clause. It is moved in exactly the same spirit as my previous Amendment. I am trying to make the position clearer and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1170">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
more understandable. If I fail to do so, I apologise to the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find the subsection rather difficult to understand. Hon. Members reading it would have to sit down and scratch their heads for the exact meaning of
	<br><blockquote><p>"has a water closet available for the exclusive use of the occupants of the house within the house or, where the house forms part of a building, within that building and readily accessible from within the house or building, as the case may be."</p></blockquote>
When I first read that, the meaning seemed plain and simple, but the more I looked at it and the more I thought about it, the more meanings I drew. I should like to be clear about the meaning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of these two Amendments would be to make the paragraph read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"has a water closet within the house, or where the house forms part of a building, within that building, for the exclusive use of the occupants of that house."</p></blockquote>
That clarifies the wording. When a water closet is within a house, it is most likely to be for the exclusive use of the occupants of that house and the word "exclusive" is superfluous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the latter part of the paragraph, the Amendment still preserves the provision that where a water closet is not within the house, it has to be within the building and it has to be for the exclusive use of the occupants of that house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise for taking so long over the Amendment. I have been trying to make it slightly clearer, and I hope that I have succeeded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman make one point clear to me? Sometimes, people knock at a door and ask whether they may temporarily have the use of the facilities within the house. Would they be able still to do that if the hon. Gentleman removed this provision?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has answered his own question by saying "temporarily". I am sure that when he wanders down the streets of Govan and knocks on doors, he will find his constituents most co-operative to allow him temporary use of the facilities without making any sanitary inspector who is following him down the street accuse the occupants of having a house which is not up to standard because they have allowed their Member of Parliament to use its facilities. This is not the intention of the subsection or
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
the Amendment. The hon. Member should be free to move within his constituency as he wants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be interested to hear the Minister's comments on the subsection. I hope that we have helped to improve it. If not, there may be better wording. The wording could be made infinitely better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This subject has been raised by Glasgow Corporation. I telephoned the corporation to ask for its interpretation. Its interpretation, however, seems wrong to me and I am surprise that it has not been cleared up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It said that in the event of a single house on the ground floor having a closet for the exclusive use of the occupants, any attempt to tighten and improve the standards would prohibit the authority from closing the whole building, because one or two houses on the ground flat would satisfy the requirements as to a tolerable standard in this regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the corporation asked why we could not say "sole use". That seems to be playing with words, for "exclusive" and "sole" seem to be the same thing. I am surprised that no responsible body has yet clarified this with the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This discussion illustrates the point I made when we were discussing the Sittings Motion. Like the hon. Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Hugh D. Brown), I have received representations from the corporation along the same lines. It had arranged a meeting on Friday to discuss the matter with us, but the Committee stage of the Bill has come too soon. If what Glasgow Corporation has said is true, it seems that a thoroughly derelict tenement which should be pulled down will not be pulled down merely because there is one house on the ground floor which is satisfactory in that it has a water closet within the house. Under the present arrangements, which are normally less tight, it could be pulled down because the sanitary inspector would have discretion to order that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an important point. I hope that the Minister will be able to enlighten us and explain to us why Glasgow Corporation was not able to have that situation satisfactorily explained so that in this month of May, when the Bill was published in February, it had to raise this fundamental question with Glasgow Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Three hon. Members from
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1171">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>49</span>
Glasgow are present. The subsection stipulates a water closet available for the exclusive use of the occupants of the house within the house. There are tenements buildings in Glasgow, unlike those to which the hon. Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith) and my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Hugh D. Brown) have referred where there are 12 houses in the close, but where it does not necessarily follow that each house has a toilet inside each house for the exclusive use of the occupants. In such cases there is an outside toilet in the back close for the house there. This is the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are tenements where three houses are on the flat sharing one toilet on the half-landing. Such a building, with three tenants entitled to use the one toilet on the half-stair, would qualify to be pulled down. But the house in the close, although not derelict, might not meet the tolerable standard of the other 11. Yet, according to the paragraph, if it had a toilet for the exclusive use of the tenant, the local authority would be prevented from ordering its demolition, although under the present law the sanitary inspector might order its demolition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If my hon. Friend could assure us that that one thing will not exclude the right to order demolition, this provision would be satisfactory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I could add a little weight to this argument. Hon. Members have been discussing the single house in the close with the toilet in the close. In Glasgow in about one third of the houses of this type the toilet is not in the close. It is down a basement, which in Glasgow is called a "dunny". These are bad things. I have put cases before the medical officer of health to try to get medical priority for an old lady with one of these close houses with a toilet in the basement. I have not been successful. The Minister should give some leeway to the sanitary inspector to make a judgment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacKenzie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I read this provision with some care. It says that the toilet should be readily accessible from the building. Two situations arise. The first is that in not all houses, even in tenement buildings, do we have the half-landing or basement-type lavatory facilities. There are a number of houses where the toilets are on back land, which is different from
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
the traditional arrangement of which many of us are thinking. Back land means that although it may be within the building in one sense, it is exposed to the elements in another. This is a problem with which we must concern ourselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure whether we are doing enough in this subsection to deal with the problem, which is not exclusively a rural problem, of a lavatory at the bottom of the garden. It may be readily accessible. It may be part of the building. There may be a shed with a toilet at the end. Will my hon. Friend clarify the problem of back land lavatories and lavatories which are attached to houses but where one has to go into the open air?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend and I were brought up in Glasgow. I am surprised that since he has emigrated to Rutherglen he has changed "back court" to "back land". However, he is quite right. The Government's intention is that it is essential for the standard that we require that the W.C. may be reached without going into the open air. The Amendment would undermine the position that we are seeking to establish. In the next Amendment I seek to insert "suitably located". This is a result of our discussions with county councils and the sanitary inspectors association. I want to make absolutely clear what I am after. "Readily accessible" would debar the illustration given by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Central (Mr. Tom McMillan) of a toilet in the "dunny", the basement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am surprised that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith) raised the general point on behalf of Glasgow. Members and officials of the Corporation have already met the Department twice. We discussed much of the material which Glasgow Corporation has sent to hon. Members. I am sorry it has not been amended since that meeting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When was the meeting?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not have the date here, but I am told that at that meeting the corporation did accept that if the house had the exclusive use of a W.C. and met the other items in subsection (1), the local authority could not act against it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But it should be able to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the house is in a tene-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1172">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>51</span>
ment, the authority may declare the building to be a housing treatment area where only the majority of houses need to be below the tolerable standard. All would then come under the powers of Part I of the Bill. This was explained to Glasgow at meetings in February and in April. I am surprised that the Corporation has not amended its material. When my hon. Friend the Member for Provan meets the corporation on Friday, he should ask it to bring its views up to date. We have tried to meet Glasgow Corporation as much as we could because we understand that it has a particularly difficult problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) will accept that his probing Amendment has done service to us by allowing me to make clear the Government's intention. I am sure that he has no wish to reduce the
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
standard by incorporating these Amendments, and I ask that they be withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has not answered my questions in detail. He said that my Amendment would have the effect of not making it necessary that a water closet should be within the house. I say specifically that a water closet must be within the house, or, where the house forms part of a building, within that building. I cannot see how my Amendment makes it possible for the water closet to be outside the house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I still think that my Amendment makes the provision more readily understandable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
