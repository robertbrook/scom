	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 1 contains the nub of the Bill. As I explained in seeking leave to introduce the Measure on 2nd April, the whole purpose of the Bill is permissive. It is designed to allow district councils which wish to do so to make contributions to the funds of the National Mod, even if the National Mod is not held within their areas. This is a power which they do not at present have, although both town and county councils have it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that it is necessary for me to expand this point at length since I covered it in the speech I made on 2nd April. There is no doubt that district councils within the Highland area where Gaelic is spoken wish to have this power. I have a letter from the District Councils' Association expressing support for the Bill and, as the Minister will know, some district councils have already attempted to make contributions in this way but have discovered it to be outwith their power to do so. I need not say more about the provision. The point is simple, the intention is permissive, and I hope that the Clause will commend itself to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Doig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not inclined to support the Clause because I regard it as a waste of public money. We continually hear from hon. Gentlemen opposite demands for reduced public expenditure, yet the same people who clamour for less Government and local authority spending go on to make speeches calling for increased public expenditure of all kinds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
For example, I have in mind the speech made by the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) in Stonehaven last year in which he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Every pound of public expenditure is a pound less in your pocket."</p></blockquote>
In the area in which he was speaking, substantial grants are provided out of public money, and these benefit the town greatly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today we are considering another proposal from hon. Gentlemen opposite which will increase public expenditure, yet not a voice is raised from the benches opposite against this suggestion. Frankly, I cannot understand their attitude. We are asked to agree that local authorities be allowed to spend public money not for the benefit of the people in their areas but for the benefit of those living in other areas, some of which may be so distant from the former that not even 1 per cent. of their ratepayers will be able to attend these festivities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are told that the purpose of the Bill is partly cultural, but I suspect that it is simply another method of boosting what is virtually a dying language. How many people in Scotland speak Gaelic? What purpose does the language serve? Can something be expressed in this language which cannot be expressed in English? If people enjoy singing in Gaelic, cannot they enjoy singing in English? Why not allow this language to die of its own free will, as it is dying? I expressed similar views on the Floor of the House not long ago in relation to the Welsh language.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot understand how those who are opposed to public expenditure can be willing to authorise it for something of such little value as this. After all, it is difficult enough in the world today to get people to understand one another. One of the obstacles to there being better understanding among nations is the lack of knowledge of our various languages. If certain languages are dying of their own free will we should do the sensible thing and allow them to die. Instead, however, we find that hon. Gentlemen opposite, who clamour for less public expenditure, want to maintain, sustain and boost a language which would otherwise die.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is an unworthy reason for increasing public expenditure, particularly since I can think of many ways in which our precious public money could be put to better use. Frankly, I am astonished to hear a group of hon. Gentlemen who have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1371">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
consistently criticised public expenditure now trying to justify the spending of public money for a flimsy reason such as this. I therefore am unable to support the Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I doubt whether more than a tiny percentage of the people in my constituency would be in favour of spending the ratepayers' money on a proposal of this kind. We have a so-called Highland Society in Dundee; I suspect that it has only a few members. Occasionally I receive letters from the Society, but figures are never quoted—this, in itself, usually indicates that the numbers are small. I have no doubt that if its membership were large it would be shouting the fact from the housetops.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot believe that at a time of financial stringency we should agree to a proposal of this kind. At all times we must make the best possible use of all money, especially public money. We must be selective in deciding how the nation's money is spent and I cannot support a suggestion that it be spent in the way proposed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to speak this morning, but having heard the speech of the hon. Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Doig), which I can only regard as appalling, I am bound to rise in support of the Bill, upon which I congratulate the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston), particularly since it is much better than some of the Measures which we have seen emanating from the Liberal Party in recent years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, West was right to say that Gaelic is a declining language. It is regrettable that fewer people speak it every year. He was also right to say that interest in this ancient tongue is a minority one. However, it is a minority interest which has a large following outside the ranks of native Gaelic speakers. I was impressed, when the Mod was held in Perth some time ago, by the large number of people from Perth and elsewhere who listened to a presentation of songs and music from this ancient Highland culture, who enjoyed the experience and who, I believe, benefitted culturally from it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman regards this ancient tongue, this heritage, as clumsy. I regard it as something of rare and special value which we should try to preserve. I do not suggest that we should impose the speaking of Gaelic on people, because that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
would be nonsense. However, when we have, as we must have, a special regard for the survival of this tongue—after all, we teach it in our schools—we should help the continuation of a folk tradition in every way we can. The Mod is one way of doing it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It dismays me that the view of the hon. Member for Dundee, West seems to be that because this language and this annual celebration of it does not happen to interest him those whom it does interest should have no rights in the matter. He went on to say that this was a waste of public funds, and he expressed surprise that those of us who look for Governmental economies should support the spending of a sum of money in this way, however marginal that sum. That suggestion came strangely from the hon. Gentleman, who accepts and applauds the vast annual wastage of money through, for example, the Land Commission, increases in taxation which have amounted to £l¾ million a day since the 1964 General Election, the imposition of £12½ million in S.E.T. in Scotland as a result of the last Budget and many other Government measures. The tragedy of the vast increase in public expenditure under Labour is that so much of it is being devoted to extravagant and totally unnecessary, indeed harmful, purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We spend some money on museums, opera and the arts generally. If it is right that we should do that, it is also right that a small part of this cultural expenditure should be devoted to the National Mod. I believe that we should do everything possible to encourage the interest which a great many people in Scotland, outside Dundee apparently, have in this ancient language, which many of us love dearly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Lawson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) I would have expected this little Bill to have gone through on the nod. However, perhaps it is as well that my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Doig) should have provoked some discussion of the subject. After all, he is entitled to his view; although I suspect that if this money were being devoted to an activity connected with chess he would have taken a different view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suppose that, as a result of my hon. Friend's criticism of hon. Gentlemen opposite about their clamour for reductions in public expenditure, he asked for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1372">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
the rebuttal which he received from the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire. I take the view that there is nothing wrong in having public expenditure and that, in some respects, there is to it no ceiling beyond which the nation cannot go. In many respects public expenditure is advantageous. Indeed, we get better value in many instances from money spent publicly than we do from money spent privately. For example, if we individually had to pay dustmen—we used to call them scaffies—to have our garbage removed as well as for our water and so on, these services would cost us a lot more than they do at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the extension of the type of activity proposed by the Bill and I am pleased to see the Measure coming forward. We do not do nearly enough to promote this kind of activity through local authorities. For many years my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Hannan) has sought to induce local authorities to spend more money in Scotland on this type of activity. One need only compare what we in Scotland do from the cultural point of view with, say, what is done on the Continent, to see that the richness of life in Scotland could be greatly improved. Indeed, considering how little we do on this score, I sometimes wonder how it is possible for us to have any people still living in Scotland. In many cases we measure the harshness, the bareness, of life in many Scottish towns. I welcome this proposal. I should like to see it taken up on a much larger scale. Although the Bill must be permissive, the more successful it becomes and the more money that is spent on this—spent money is not necessarily wasted; it depends on what is got for it—the better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is so much in our past that we ought not to lose. It is a great pity that many Scottish youngsters grow up never knowing Scottish songs. I am not talking merely of Gaelic songs. We boast, for example, of Robert Burns, yet how few of our youngsters could properly go through a song of Robert Burns—word and tune perfect? How few could render that great piece, Tam O'Shanter? [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I would not sing it, but on occasions it gives me great pleasure to render that poem and other pieces by Robert
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
Burns—"Holy Willie's Prayer" and "The Twa Dogs". They are all part of our culture. Without this we are indistinguishable from the common mob.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I am very much with the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston). This Bill can be seen as a little acorn which will grow into the great oak in terms of Scottish culture and which will enrich the lives of the people of Scotland. I wish the hon. Member well for his Bill. Although I recognise the right of my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, West to voice his point of view, I believe that his point of view is a lone one on this side of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to keep the Committee only a moment or two, and I would probably have been even shorter if the hon. Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Doig) had not spoken, I find myself, as I have occasionally but not always in the past, in almost complete agreement with the hon. Member for Motherwell (Mr. Lawson), basically for these reasons. This small but important Bill will give district councils which exist in Gaelic speaking areas, and indeed, I would hope, one or two district councils in the lowland area, too, if they so wish, the power to spend a small part—it is inevitably a very small part—of their ratepayers' money to support something which I believe is, if not central to Scottish history and tradition, at any rate an important part of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not accept the view of the hon. Member for Dundee, West that Gaelic is of its own accord a dying language. It has certainly become very much less important in the life of most Gaelic-speaking areas than it was in the past. In my constituency, in Argyll, thirty years ago perhaps 65 per cent or 70 per cent of the people understood or spoke Gaelic. Today it is a much smaller percentage, but it is still an important part of their lives, and many of the young people are learning the language and learning it with enjoyment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that this in any way detracts from their learning as children. Children in countries which have more difficult languages—for example, Jugoslavia and Norway—have to learn three or four languages to enable themselves easily to be understood as they travel round the world. We in Britain are luckier than some peoples, because most people understand English in some form and we can
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1373">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
get by more easily, but it is an important part of the training of children's minds to learn different languages, and I see no harm but great benefit flowing from Scottish children learning two or three languages, of which Gaelic could be one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it difficult to be entirely enthusiastic about the prospects of attracting tourists to Scotland, in particular to the Highlands, if all that we can present to those who come to our very beautiful part of the world is—though certainly different, and imposing and wonderful—scenery, and if in the evenings the only thing they can do is to go to cafes and listen to rock and roll or pop music; in that case they might just as well be in any other part of the world. It is only by keeping the tradition of Gaelic, and so on, that it is possible to put on, as happens in many parts of the Highlands, a ceilidh in the evening—often quite small, but of great interest and attraction to tourists. It is different; it is something they perhaps cannot hear anywhere else, and it is in itself an attraction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill would give district councils, as the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston), who is to be congratulated on bringing it forward, says, the power to contribute something towards what is part of our national tradition. I think this is right. I do not want to expand on the question whether public money will be spent or wasted. One hopes very much—I think all of us do—that as the Mod becomes more fixed in the minds of Scottish people as a whole it will in the long term attract enough support from amongst its enthusiastic supporters not to require a great deal of assistance from district councils or, indeed, from anybody else. However, at this time it needs support to assist it in what it is trying to do. I support the hon. Member for Inverness. This is a small amount of money. It will not be wasted. I hope very much that the Government, too, will support this small but important Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Bill and congratulate the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) on introducing it. The Gaelic language may not be so widespread throughout the Highland areas as it was in former times, but it is still cherished by an important minority; and in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan), who is by some quirk of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
Parliamentary fate excluded from this Committee, it remains the principal language.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It does not fall to those like myself who are English speakers to speak with lyrical enthusiasm about the Gaelic heritage, but [understand that the key to the history of the Highlands lies in an understanding of this language. The records throughout the half of Scotland which is the Highlands are for the most part in the Gaelic language. I fear that, if this language were to languish, all that part of Scottish history would be lost. I believe that interest in the Gaelic culture is reviving in the Highlands. This is greatly to be welcomed. Because of the spread of a uniform culture throughout Western Europe we are in danger of losing our distinctiveness, the special contribution which we have made and which we can make to the civilisation of Western Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Gaelic language has its parallels in many countries in Western Europe in the sense that it is a minority language understood by few, but cherished by few. The Basque language, the Friesian language and a number of other minority languages in Germany, are still protected, preserved and understood by people in those countries. It would be a serious loss if the Gaelic language were altogether to fall into desuetude.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of this modest but important Bill is the entirely laudable one of enabling communities which have an interest in the language and culture of Gaeldom to support the National Mod. Like the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) I imagine that it is indeed probable—and that may be better—that in time this event will be at least self-supporting, and possibly, through its successful operation, may even enable the profits to be spread more widely in fostering the language and the culture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Doig) that by fostering a language which is not the prime language in Scotland we are in some way making communication more difficult. This contention by my hon. Friend does not stand up to scrutiny, because, for the most part, there are very few people who speak Gaelic only. At the last census of the language taken in my constituency there was only one person who could understand Gaelic only. If we allow the Gaelic language to die, we shall, on the contrary, create a problem of com-

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
munication. We shall create a problem of communication with our own history, and we shall find it less easy to understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, West asks, cannot those who are enthusiastic devotees of and singers in Gaelic learn to enjoy singing in English? Of course they can.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And they do. Many of the beautiful old songs were written to be sung in Gaelic and are not transliterable into English and would probably be lost if the language were lost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My place this morning would have been better taken by my hon. Friend the Member for the Western Isles who is himself a Gaelic speaker. Once again, I express my regret at his absence, but congratulate the hon. Member for Inverness, and express the hope that his Bill will be given a speedy passage through the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John P. Mackintosh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want briefly to add my support for this short Bill introduced by the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston). I, too, think that it would be a disaster if the Gaelic language were to disappear, partly for the reasons advanced by my hon. Friend the Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Mr. Maclennan)—the historical and traditional reasons—but also because this is not merely looking backwards into an antiquated past. The preservation and encouragement of the language keeps a type of thought, a pattern of mind, and a type of society going which I believe exist now and are vital for the area. My own interest, and that of many people in Scotland, in reviving the Highlands is not merely to make the Highlands an extension of Glasgow or of Edinburgh. Our object is to restore the life, tradition and vitality of a particular culture and outlook in the Highlands which we know and admire and which, in part, are kept going by an outlook enshrined in the language I cannot say too strongly how much people's patterns of thought, contact with their past, outlook and philosophy, from which all of us in Scotland, and indeed the whole world, have benefited, depend on the vitality of this language.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have often talked with hon. Friends
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
of mine who represent the Highlands about methods of preserving and encouraging the language. I agree with those who have said that interest in the language is increasing. Appreciation of its value is growing in the Highlands, as elsewhere. The old attitude that this was a bar to communication, which some Highlanders shared a long time ago, has disappeared, and they appreciate its value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My wife came from a Gaelic-speaking family and was determined not to learn the language because she regarded it as a symbol of the misty past. She wished to escape from it, partly because it was pushed on her by her father. That is a normal reaction, and it would be a disaster if any attempt to keep the language going involved any form of compulsion. If there were any impression that it had to be learned in Gaelic schools the resistance to the language and resentment would grow. The great virtue of the Bill is that it encourages purely voluntary effort by enthusiasts with money collected locally for the purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I add my congratulations on the excellent work An Comunn is doing in collecting records and so on, and on the thought it is putting into Highland affairs. It is an example of Highlanders doing things for themselves. One of the great tragedies of the Highlands in the past hundred years is that most of the efforts aimed at reviving and encouraging life there and developing the Highlands have come from well-meaning but perhaps not fully comprehending people from outside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now and in the near future we want more work of the kind An Comunn is doing, with people living in the Highlands deciding what they want and helping themselves through money collected through their own local authorities and bodies of this kind. The less that is done by Princes Street Highlanders and well wishers from outside the better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that An Comunn, which is beginning to speak for a certain part of the Highlands, will continue to do this, and will appreciate that economic development underlies and underpins linguistic and cultural development, but that this development is necessary if people are to have a viable community. Local political development plus language and recreational developments must all go together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If they realise this, this offers a chance, with the work of the Highlands and Islands

Development Board, and all the other activities in the area, of producing a viable community which will not need outside assistance and the interest of antiquarians, but will have a life and vigour of its own and can look after itself. I am sure that this is our ultimate objective, and I congratulate the hon. Member for Inverness on moving in this direction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the next speaker, I draw the attention of the Committee to the fact that the natural affinity of the Chair with Scottish affairs has been pretty indulgent in listening to a number of very interesting Second Reading speeches. The terms of the Clause are considerably narrower than has been suggested to date and I hope that the Committee will wish to bear that in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Bruce Millan)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On behalf of the Government, I welcome the Clause. It has a fairly narrow effect, but an important one in itself, and an important effect in outlining our support for the Gaelic language, which has been the gist of the speeches we have heard in support of the Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Clause removes an anomaly. In many parts of Scotland district councils are much more interested than town and county councils in helping the National Mod, but they have been prevented from doing so by our existing legislation, whereas town and county councils have been able to get special dispensation from the Secretary of State under Section 339 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act, 1947, to make contributions towards the National Mod. Where county councils or town councils have made applications to the Secretary of State under that Section, authority has been granted. Town and county councils will also be able to make contributions to the Mod under the provisions of the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to anticipate what the hon. Gentleman may be about to say, but could he give an indication of the number of dispensations which have been granted, and the sort of money involved?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could not say offhand, but the sums involved are very small.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 339 of the 1947 Act has not applied to district councils, and, therefore,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
they have been completely excluded from making contributions to the National Mod, unless it happened to take place in their own areas or was convenient for them and they were able to go through the rather elaborate procedure, which did not work at all, to enable them to make a contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Clause gives the district councils, in particular, the opportunity to make contributions to the National Mod whether or not the Mod is being held within their own areas, and without having to obtain the consent of the authority for the area in which the Mod is being held. In that respect the Bill is very useful, and I congratulate the hon. Member for Inverness on introducing it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amount of money involved is likely to be quite small, because the Mod is pretty self-supporting. It is a remarkable tribute to An Comunn and the people in the Highland areas who raise money voluntarily in their own localities to support the Mod that it has been sustained and strengthened over the years with very little expenditure of public money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the Minister would recognise, none the less, that, although what he says is true, the Mod is largely used by the oragnisation of An Comunn Gaidhealach as the generating point for funds for the whole organisation, so that the way the hon. Gentleman states the position is not quite complete?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take that point. I am simply stating, in answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Doig) that people in the Highlands and those associated with An Comunn have not been simply sitting back waiting for public money to come in to sustain the Mod or other activities of An Comunn. It would be a disservice to them and unfair to suggest that that is the position. In fact, they raise a considerable amount of money in many localities to support the Mod and other activities of An Comunn. But there is an obligation on Government and local authorities to help in the sustenance of the Gaelic language, and I am very glad that we can do this though the Bill and in a number of other ways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Compared with what other countries spend on minority languages we have very little to congratulate ourselves on. We spend very little on the furtherance of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1376">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
Gaelic. Until recently An Comunn had no Government assistance at all. I am glad to say that we started to give it assistance in 1967, when we gave the very small sum of £1,000 as a grant from the Government. In the current year that grant has risen to £7,000. Even though Governmental assistance has increased substantially, we are still talking about very small sums of money. I might add, however, that we have recently given a grant of £5,000 to Glasgow University to assist the publication of new and original works in the Gaelic language. As far as I know, this is the first time the Government have given any assistance in this field, and I am very happy to have been associated with these developments over the past year or two.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As many hon. Members have said, it is very true that if we lost the Gaelic language completely, as there was a danger that we might until recently, we would have lost a very important part of the Scottish heritage and something we should encourage, stimulate and extend for the future. Unless we do, a good deal of our understanding of Scotland and Scottish history will be gone for ever.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All that is happening here is that we are giving a very limited permissive power to district councils to help in a very considerable task, which, apart from the education authorities, has fallen on the shoulders of An Comunn up to now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a very useful Clause and a very useful Bill, and I am happy to express the Government's support for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Johnston: I should like briefly to reply, particularly to the points made by the hon. Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Doig), and also to thank those right hon. and hon. Members who have contributed to the debate and said such kind things about the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister rightly said, the amount of money involved is very small. It is so tiny as to be almost pathetic. I welcome the tone of the hon. Gentleman's concluding remarks, in which he admited that, compared with the treatment of minority languages in other parts of Europe, we in Scotland do not do well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, West, after all, is in favour of public expenditure. It is not a question of being for or against public expenditure but of being for or against a particular kind of public expenditure. The particular kind which we are dis-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
cussing is very good, in my view, and I am glad to learn that that is also the view of the vast majority of Members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked for figures. He indicated that one tended to conceal the number of people who might be involved and were interested and might therefore be affected by the Clause. The number of people involved in Gaelic activities is fairly high. There are about 8,700 taking part in mods, 75 per cent. of whom are children. Assuming an average class of 12 in the 75 further education classes, that is a further 1,000. There are about 12 drama groups averaging 10 people in each. Thus there are about 10,000 a year, actively concerned with the activities. About 1½ million people follow the National Mod on television, and about 12,000 actually attend it. So the numbers involved are large when one bears in mind that Scotland has a population of only 5 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equally, as the hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Mr. Maclennan), who was kind enough to agree to be a sponsor of the Bill, has pointed out, there are areas in Scotland, particularly that represented by the hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm Macmillan) where many people speak Gaelic. The hon. Gentleman is also a sponsor of the Bill, and I agree that it is a great pity that he is not here, because I am sure that we would have had the benefit of his very informed comment. About 80 per cent. of the people in the Western Isles speak Gaelic as a native language.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not quite sure what sort of flat, grey Philistinian world the hon. Member for Dundee, West wants us to live in, but it is not the sort of world I would be attracted by. An Comunn Gaidhealach seeks to encourage the teaching and learning and use of Gaelic, the study and cultivation of Highland literature, history, music, art and traditions, the social economic welfare of the Highlands and Islands, and the wearing of Highland dress. All these things are an important part of life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister and the hon. Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Mackintosh) dwelt on the fact that we do not know very much about environmental influences. Environment and social values are things that grow up over the years, and cannot be suddenly implanted in the same way as one gives a development grant to an area. In the Gaelic-speaking areas there
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1377">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
is continuity and stability. How they are related to language, one does not know, but they are. As the hon. Member for Berwick and East Lothian said, and as I am sure the Minister recognises, it is an important part of the task of economically developing the Highlands that we do not want in the north a carbon copy or mirror image of the Central Belt. This is not to say that I do not like the Central Belt, but I do not like to have everything the same. It is important to have variety in life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I introduced the Bill I did not feel it necessary to make much of a speech, because the Bill is very limited. The amount of money involved is small. The right to give is wholly permissive. Nevertheless, as the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) was kind enough to say, it is a small contribution to something bigger, and I look upon it in that view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will accept this Clause. The self-generation of communities is important and language is part of the development of their economy. The Faroe Islands are a good example. The fact that they have concentrated on language is a not-unimportant part of their economic success. I appreciate the assistance given by the Under-Secretary of State and the Government in this matter, particularly the hon. Gentleman's remarks to the effect that we do not as a community in Scotland assist Gaelic on any scale comparable to the way in which our European brothers across the Channel assist their minority languages. This is the first time, I believe, that a Minister has frankly stated this, and I welcome it. I hope it bodes well for the future attitude of the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) said that we all benefited culturally from the Mod. I am puzzled to know how people who live a hundred miles or more away from where the Mod takes place benefit culturally, since even if they happen to be there on holiday by coincidence, they are unable to understand a word. How do they benefit?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not seeking to prevent people from contributing to the Mod—from their own pockets: they have a right to do so if they wish. The issue at stake here is whether the ratepayers' money should be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
used outside their local area—very often far away—in order to preserve or help finance something, not one word of which will be understood by the contributing ratepayers even if they get there. Contributing privately towards the Mod is quite different from spending other people's money on it, and that is why I cannot support the Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire raised a point about increased taxation. The amount of money raised by taxation under the Conservative Government—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. There is no point in the hon. Member trying to follow paths which he knows perfectly well are not permissible under this Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Miss Harvie Anderson, you allowed the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire to say these things and I do not see why I should not be allowed to rebut him. He made a wrong statement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was quite correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was a wrong statement. However, I will leave that matter for another time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Motherwell (Mr. Lawson) said that there was nothing wrong with public expenditure. I agree. I have constantly advocated increased public expenditure in certain matters, but what is proposed here is not a proper use for public expenditure. If the hon. Gentleman had proposed that we should spend public money on making more widespread public knowledge of Burns' works I would have supported it. [Hon. Members: "Why?"] Because everyone in Scotland would be able to understand it. The large majority of the people cannot understand Gaelic, but the hon. Gentleman wants to spend money on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) has told us that it would be terrible if we made the Highlands into another Glasgow or Edinburgh. But what do the Highlands constantly advocate? They are always saying that we should take all the things in Glasgow and Edinburgh and put them in the Highlands. They want industry there—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I repeat that there is no point in the hon. Member pursuing these courses which he knows to be out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1378">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, I must object to the fact, Miss Harvie Anderson, that you allowed hon. Members oposite to raise all these points and did not object in any way at all to their doing so, but that when I seek to raise the same points you object. However, I must defer to your Ruling, but I think it is a very unfair one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Clause seeks to permit the ratepayers' money to be devoted to a purpose which the vast majority of Scottish ratepayers will never see and would not understand a word of if they did.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman saying that the duly-elected representatives of the ratepayers are unable to make any kind of decision about permissive legislation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I am not saying that at all, but I am trying to be consistent. In the past the Government have laid down that it is illegal for local authorities to help other areas in certain cases, even although, for instance, when there is a disaster in an area they want to help in this way. Yet such causes would bem uch more worthy of public expenditure than this one. I cannot see why we should single out the Mod in this way. In the main it has little value. I realise that I am in a minority of one. Nevertheless, I do not see why this should go through unnoticed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mackintosh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend not accept, though, the general proposition that it is desirable that local authorities should be allowed to contribut not only to things of the kind my hon. Friend has mentioned but also to things of the kind mentioned in this Bill, and that if we give broader permissive power of this sort to local authorities, of which he was himself once a member, surely we should trust them to decide what their electors are willing and able to give? Surely we can trust them in this matter, in the same way as we trust them in others?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether my hon. Friend has been a member of a local authority. I was a member of one for ten years and I know that, when something of this nature comes before a local authority, there is a marked reluctance on the part of every member to oppose such a proposition, although they may think it wrong, and very often do—and I have spoken to many councillors after meetings
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
when this has happened. Let us suppose that in Berwick Town Council someone proposes to send £100 to Glasgow following a disaster there. The disaster has nothing to do with Berwick, but would a single member of the Town Council oppose the proposition? Many might be against it, but I do not believe that any one of them would have the courage to stand up and oppose it. When something like the Mod is boosted as being Scottish—and it is Scottish—it is extremely difficult for a member of a local authority to oppose giving ratepayers' money to it. The fact that it benefits only a tiny section of the Scottish people apparently does not matter. Nor, apparently, does it matter that the vast majority of the Scottish people cannot understand a word of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But that is why it does matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Such a situation means that councillors will be terribly reluctant to oppose such a proposition. It is in the nature of politicians that they are frightened to speak up in some circumstances. A large proportion are afraid that they will lose votes by opposing something, so they stay silent and allow the thing to go through. I have experienced this over and over again in many years on a local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to make cuts in public expenditure, then what is proposed here is one type of public expenditure that we could cut without any difficulty or hardship. The right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) said that a smaller percentage than formerly is Gaelic-speaking in his area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, he says that Gaelic is not a dying language. If fewer and fewer people speak a language, then it is surely dying. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State agreed that Gaelic would probably have died out altogether if it had not been for such injections as this. But it would be better to allow it to die out, if no one is interested in it and it has to be artificially stimulated. Regardless of the fact that my colleagues appear to disagree with me, this is a reasonable point of view.
