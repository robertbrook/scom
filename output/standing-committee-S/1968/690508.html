	<p>10.31 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Dr. J. Dickson Mabon)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although we are making excellent progress on the Bill, and it is quite possible that we might finish it next week, I should like to give notice that on Tuesday morning I shall move a Motion that the Committee sit again on Tuesday afternoon. No doubt the Committee will want to debate that then.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
</section>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 28</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>COMPULSORY ACQUISITION OF LAND IN CONNECTION WITH DEVELOPMENT AND FOR OTHER PLANNING PURPOSES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like very briefly to ask one or two questions regarding this Clause. At our meeting on Tuesday we debated Amendment No. 140, which was moved by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Pentland (Mr. Wylie), which probed the question as to what extent these powers of compulsory acquisition would coincide with the general outline of development plans, as contained in the structure plan and, in particular, in the local plan. I should like to go further than we did on Tuesday and ask the Minister of State to give a slightly better assurance that these powers of compulsory acquisition—I know that the Minister wants to be flexible, as he said so on Tuesday—will be used, in general, in accordance with what is in the structure plan or the local plan, despite the specific reasons under which compulsory acquisition can take—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. May we have rather less conversation? It is rather hard to hear the hon. Member.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>392</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We seem to be having competition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Minister of State on Tuesday wanted a fairly flexible number of conditions under which the Secretary of State might be satisfied if land were to be compulsorily acquired, it would help a great deal if people whose land might be compulsorily acquired knew that the reasons were, in general, in line with what was contained in the structure or local plan. By looking at the plan they might then form a fairly good estimate of what might be happening in the future, and of whether their land or property might come under compulsory acquisition. After all, if a general indication is not available in the structure or local plan, and somebody then has property compulsorily acquired, or if there were put on their property a compulsory acquisition order which does not seem to have any tie up with the structure or local plan, it will cause a great deal of uncertainty and bewilderment as to the planning purpose for which the land has been acquired. Therefore, if the local and structure plans are to be relevant and taken seriously it is important that there should be a tie in between the structure and local plans and the purpose for which powers of compulsory acquisition may be taken. That is the first point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point is regarding publicity when a compulsory order is proposed. Under Schedule 1 to the Acquisition of Land (Authorisation Procedure) (Scotland) Act, 1947, it is very clearly laid down what publicity there should be. Paragraph 3 of Schedule 1 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Before submitting the order to the confirming authority, the acquiring authority shall</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(	<i>a</i>) in two successive weeks publish in one or more local newspapers circulating in the locality in which the land comprised in the order is situated a notice in the prescribed form …"</p></blockquote>
There is nothing specific in this Clause regarding publicity for compulsory purchase orders, and it is extremely important that we should have an assurance that full publicity will be given, as is required in Schedule 1 to the 1947 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I should like some clarification from the Minister in relation to subsection (1)(d), which says
	<br><blockquote><p>"that it is expedient to acquire the land immediately for a purpose …"</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1033">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>393</span>
I should like to ask under what circumstances the Minister imagines that there will be this necessity to acquire the land immediately. If there is a circumstance which makes it necessary to acquire the land immediately, then how exactly does the time that may be taken to give publicity to a compulsory purchase order tie in with the consultations which are necessary under subsection (2), and with the need for an inquiry when a compulsory purchase order is opposed? This may be all taken care of, but it would be helpful if the Minister could give us an assurance about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Dickson Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the first point, the hon. Gentleman is perfectly right in as much as the prior designation or allocation of land in the development plan is no longer necessary. There is this flexibility on the part of the authority. On the other hand, the authority is obliged to conform to the provisions of paragraphs (	<i>a</i>) (	<i>b</i>) (c) and (	<i>d</i>) of subsection (1) of this Clause, and, given the fact, also, that subsection (4) of this Clause applies the procedure laid down in the Acquisition of Land (Authorisation Procedure) (Scotland) Act, 1947, from which the hon. Gentleman read part of one of the Schedules, these procedures, including the publicity, have to be carried out properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked me to give him an example of a circumstance where it would be
	<br><blockquote><p>"expedient to acquire the land immediately for a purpose".</p></blockquote>
The one that springs to my mind is land for industry. It may be necessary, not primarily to zone land—it may be agreed that it should be zoned—but to acquire land to get an access road. In my own constituency we had the land for industry, but we discovered that the access road was not suitable for the kind of vehicles which would be seeking entrance and exit to and from the industrial land. We did not employ a compulsory purchase order, because, to a large extent, we were able to explain the situation to the people concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is perhaps the point at which I should sit down: that part of the exercise of this Bill is to persuade people of the needs of the community and, where it is inevitable to seek a compulsory
	<span class='label label-info column'>394</span>
purchase order, to seek one with great reluctance. I know that compulsory purchase orders are not the happiest of human experiences on either side—either of the promoters, the county council or the town council, or of the persons from whom the land is being acquired. I quite appreciate that they tend to set up a great deal of friction. But in certain circumstances they are necessary. This is, to some extent, a repeat of, I think, Section 35 of the 1947 Act. I suggest to hon. Gentlemen that, given that we are having subsection (4), and given the assurance which I gave at the previous Sitting, and the one that I am giving now, they might be satisfied that Clause 28 should stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Clause ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
</section>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 29</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>COMPULSORY ACQUISITION OF LAND BY CERTAIN MINISTERS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 139, in page 29, line 16, leave out subsection (1).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is purely a probing Amendment, and I should like to ask the Minister why, later on in this Bill—for example, his Amendment, No. 117, to Clause 40, his Amendment 118, to Clause 47, and his Amendment 119 to Clause 49—he is substituting the words "Secretary of State" for "Minister of Public Building and Works". I should be very interested to know why these substitutions are being made. We raise the matter at this point because this is the first time that the Minister of Public Building and Works has been mentioned. In particular, we should like to know whether the reason for this is that there has been a change, or a change is contemplated, in the relationship between the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Public Building and Works.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reason why we are making Amendments later on, applying the Secretary of State's office rather than that of the Minister of Public Building and Works, is that this Government have been seeking to devolve a great deal of power from Whitehall to Scotland. I am willing to debate that when we come to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1034">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>395</span>
it, but the fact is that a transference of functions from the Minister of Public Building and Works to the Secretary of State has been going on. In this circumstance, however, this is a direct application of the remaining functions of the Minister of Public Building and Works where, in discharge of these, he has to acquire land compulsorily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have abolished his power as of this moment under Clause 27 of the Bill, but this change applies the previous power under the 1947 Act for the Minister of Public Building and Works to acquire land compulsorily. It is always the policy of the Ministry to acquire land by agreement, and the existence of the compulsory powers is always regarded in the Ministry as an instrument of last resort. I think it is perfectly right that both parties forming Government have used this power sparingly, but have accepted the necessity that it may be necessary to have sites in the right place forthcoming at the right time. Accordingly, I ask the Committee to give us this power. I realise that this is a probing Amendment, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman is satisfied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his explanation; in particular, on the question of the circumstances in which there is this devolution of power from the Minister of Public Building and Works to the Secretary of State for Scotland, which we shall want to discuss later. To get the explanation was the main reason why I moved this Amendment. As the Minister has indicated that he will deal with this later I shall not attempt to talk about it now. We on this side of the Committee certainly accept the need, so far as public service is concerned, to have these powers of compulsory acquisition, though, as the Minister of State himself said, these Dowers should be used infrequently. We certainly do not oppose the spirit or the principle of this subsection. In those circumstances, and in the hope that we are going to discuss the matter later, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn</i>.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. W. H. K. Baker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to raise one rather important point on sub-
	<span class='label label-info column'>396</span>
section (2), which refers to the Postmaster-General acquiring compulsorily, and so on. Before the House at the moment there is the Post Office Bill which, for some extraordinary reason, is finding difficulty in getting on to the Statute Book. I do not think we need go into the reason for that at the moment, but I understand that, as a result of that Bill, there will be established a Minister of Posts and Telegraphs. When the Post Office Bill becomes an Act, will it be necessary to amend for that purpose the Bill now before us, or is there a provision in the Post Office Bill to take care of this point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is that we cannot presume—no Government can—that any Bill will become law, and therefore in this Bill we must treat the circumstances as they were and are now, even although the Bill has been introduced. When the Post Office Bill becomes law whatever form it takes will require application to this Bill and we will accordingly seek to amend this Bill. But knowing the excellent co-operation we have been receiving in the House and in this Committee I have no doubt these two matters will chime in very well and we will make this adjustment. I am grateful to the hon. Member for pointing this out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Banff (Mr. W. H. K. Baker) has raised a real point here. I am impressed by the Minister of State's realistic attitude; he has not presumed that he is able necessarily to get any particular legislation on to the Statute Book. We on this side admire and respect him for that, although we realise that the events of recent days have forced this realism on him, for it was not there a few weeks ago. We admire that he is at last beginning to face the facts of life, and we congratulate him on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to know exactly what will happen. Can the Minister of State go slightly further? I have not followed the Post Office Bill in all its ramifications, and through all its stages and in all its details. Just what will the position be and what Amendment is there likely to be to this Clause at a later stage? If the hon. Gentleman is correct and the Post Office Bill goes through the House we are going to have an Amendment to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1035">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>397</span>
this Bill at an early stage. So can he be more forthcoming in answering my hon. Friend in telling us what the position will be, rather than leave it in a general sense?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has always been the essence of British Parliamentary democracy that if Bills are thought by the Government not to be wise they are withdrawn. We have had examples—26 examples, I think—of this in the last 20 years, of which the majority were withdrawn by Conservatives, even though they had an overwhelming majority in the House. That is just an example of the pressure of events. The Government should always be prepared to listen to arguments both from its own back benchers and from the Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot predict what will be the outcome of the debates on the Post Office Bill, to which the hon. Gentleman has not been applying himself with his usual diligence. As a Minister I can only wait to see what Parliament disposes of in relation to the Post Office Bill to see how we should correct or amend this Bill. I can assure the Committee that when Parliament disposes of the Post Office Bill we shall be in a position to make adjustments to this Bill also.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='clause'>Clause 30</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>POWER OF AUTHORITIES POSSESSING COMPULSORY PURCHASE POWERS TO MAKE GENERAL VESTING DECLARATIONS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the next Amendment, No. 141, we can take also No. 144, in Clause 66, page 61, line 21, leave out from 'operation' to 'comprised' in line 22.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 141, in page 29, line 32, leave out from 'Act' to 'shall' in line 34.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am interested in this particular part of the Clause for two reasons, first for a reason of a purely drafting nature. It seems to us on this side that it is strange to add these extra words which we propose to delete when everything in these
	<span class='label label-info column'>398</span>
words is, as the Clause already states, quite clearly contained in Schedule 2. It merely is a cross-reference to the same provisions in the Land Commission Act, 1967. Why is it felt necessary to make this cross-reference which adds nothing to the substance of the Bill? The Minister may think it adds information for anyone reading the Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I am interested that this cross-reference should have been thought necessary when, as the Minister of State must know, the life of the Land Commission is not necessarily going to be unlimited. The Land Commission may be merely historical after the next General Election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Until the hon. Gentleman's concluding words I was going to tell him that life was a fatal disease and in the long term, as Lord Keynes said, We should all be dead. I would expect that if the Conservatives by some mischance come to power they would have second thoughts about the usefulness of the Land Commission; but since their chances of getting to power are becoming even more remote, that possibility does not exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Land Commission is doing good work, and will for a number of years to come. So we must take into account references to it in the appropriate legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am attracted by the proposition in Amendment 141. I do not dissent from the fact that the words in parenthesis are not very helpful. It is true that if the reader looks at this he has a cross-reference, and perhaps to that extent they are helpful, but, on the other hand, the reader still has to go to Schedule 2 to get the precise terms of the provisions relating to the Bill, and I am prepared to recommend that we should accept Amendment 141 and delete the words in parenthesis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment 144 is of a similar style to No. 141, but I would not share the view that it would be wise to delete the words. Without the definition, the words there have no meaning. I presume the Amendment has been put down to provide a basis for some other matter that might be debated but has not been mentioned so far. There is always a balance to be struck between the advantages and disadvantages of proceeding by reference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1036">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>399</span>
The hon. Member is right about Amendment 141, but I would ask him to look again at what he is suggesting in Amendment No. 144. In that case the balance is, in my view, in favour of keeping in the reference, for the issues arising there from this provision of the Land Commission Act are of more general importance than the issues arising on this Clause. These arise in every case of development. I do not think there is any risk that anyone will be put at a disadvantage by misunderstanding the meaning of the words. The definition in Section 64 of the Land Commission Act could scarcely be less exigent in what it regards as carrying out the specified operations; for example, the digging of a trench is enough. So ignorance would not involve any risk of falling short.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reference here which, after all, does in 11 words what would otherwise take us well over 100, is a valuable brevity and not an inconvenience to anyone. With that Solomon's judgment I think the hon. Member might concur.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister of State's acceptance of this Amendment so early on. The circumstances of these two Amendments, although they are very similar in drafting form, have different applications.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I seek your guidance, Mr. Brewis? Would it be in order to discuss, with this Clause, Schedule 2, which is substantively part of this Clause? I personally think it would be most use ful if we could do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we discuss Schedule 2 now we shall not be able to discuss it in the appropriate place; so I would be inclined to think that would not be a good idea.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Brewis. I will endeavour not to stray too far out of this Clause into the Schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Clause is an important one and it gives effect to the promise given by the Government in the White Paper, Town and Country Planning, Cmnd. 3333 of June, 1967, on page 6, where it states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the opportunity will be taken to implement the undertaking given in the White Paper on
	<span class='label label-info column'>400</span>
the Land Commission to enable all public authorities to use the vesting procedure available to the Land Commission."</p></blockquote>
No doubt the vast majority of local authorities will welcome this general vesting declaration machinery, because it is a sort of shorthand or quick method of getting what we intend. It is, of course, the one part of the Land Commission Act which I can assure the Minister of State we in the Tory Party will be retaining when we come to power. That was a useful innovation, and I am persuaded that the Government have decided it is such a good thing that it is worth preserving in Statute, and rather than see it go down the drain with the Land Commission Act they have incorporated it in this Bill. To that extent I congratulate them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the general vesting declaration is made is it a fact that any compulsory purchase order will need confirmation by the Secretary of State?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I would like to ask about the word "land", in subsection (1), in page 29, line 36. Does the term "land" include buildings standing on the land? Does it include water?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The other point I would like to make is that, as local authorities are in favour, in general, of this Clause, and of the

	<span class='label label-info column'>401</span>
Schedule which gives effect to the provisions, I am wondering if the Minister of State—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>The CHAIRMAN'S 	<i>attention having been called to the fact that ten Members were not present, he suspended the proceedings; and other Members having come into the Room, and ten Members being present, the proceedings were resumed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point I was trying to make when I was so necessarily interrupted by the Chair is that I would like to know from the hon. Gentleman the Minister of State if the powers given to the local authority under this Clause will allow the authority to go forward without a formal conveyance, and if this is so, as I gather it is, whether the conveyance will be carried out subsequently and bow long after?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, concerning the word "authority" in page 29, line 42, does this include district councils which may or may not be interested in this, or is the district council authority vested for this purpose in the local planning authority which in the case of a county is the county council?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It shows the desire of my hon. Friend to please hon. Members opposite and his anxiety to get this Clause through that he should worsen this Clause by accepting the deletion of a couple of lines, which I thought were useful, just because the Amendment was put down by hon. Members opposite. It seemed to me that these two lines which were in the Clause could be very useful to lawyers who had to handle this Bill, because without having to turn to the Schedule they would be able to see that the principle of general vesting declarations would be applicable. From a practical lawyer's point of view that would have been found useful. I must ask my hon. Friend not to be too generous to the Opposition at the expense of the convenience of the people who have to operate these things.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would also remind hon. Gentlemen opposite of the old saying that one swallow does not make an election—does not make a summer. Because they did rather well yesterday it should not be taken as a guarantee that they are going to win the next Election. They are living in Cloud Cuckoo Land and, Mr. Brewis.
	<span class='label label-info column'>402</span>
you should rule this hypothetical discussion out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the risk of breaking the rules of order I would refer to the words used by the hon. Gentleman, "one swallow". The benches opposite having become so accustomed to having to swallow words that I think that perhaps it was a slightly unfortunate phrase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Clause as we understand it, extends to local authorities the same powers to vest in land as are available already to the Land Commission without completing formal conveyancing, and so on, and leaving matters of compensation to be settled later. As my hon. Friend the Member for Banff (Mr. W. H. K. Baker) said, so far as the Land Commission is concerned one can understand why this is necessary. The Land Commission is a body which purchases land and is supposed to be disposing of it again, and this method of speeding up the system of vesting powers is important. In certain circumstances, particularly in simplifying procedure, it is something that could be useful also for local authorities, although I cannot see the same pressing need for this so far as local authorities are concerned. When a local authority acquires land it is going to hold on to it. Therefore, I would be interested to see in what circumstances the Minister of State believes it is necessary to bring the Clause in. There are procedural advantages, but not to the same extent as in the case of the Land Commission. Is it only for procedural reasons that this is put in, or does the Minister of State envisage the extra power being given to local authorities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) did not want me to accept the Amendment he should have spoken up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

On the questions I was asked concerning industrial buildings, certainly "land" includes land covered with water. That is contained in the original Act. We debated it on the Land Commission Act. I was a member of the Committee as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked about the position of conveyancing. Under the vesting declaration procedure there is no conveyancing in the normal sense. Under the powers of this Clause there is a compulsory purchase order and compensation is paid in the appropriate way. I am obliged to him for pointing out that this Clause refers not only to the Land Commission but also to all planning authorities, including authorities such as small burghs which may wish to promote compulsory purchase orders. It does not include district councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the last question, about the use of these provisions, the hon. Gentleman the Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) may recollect that the Land Commission has been useful in acquiring large parts of land, for example at Erskine, and also for private developments in other parts of Scotland. In the City of Glasgow they would be useful for the expedition of comprehensive development areas. Without this procedure the work would be multiplied hundreds of times. Without this Clause a very good ally of C.D.A.s in the Statute would be lost.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is becoming more and more interesting, purely from an academic point of view.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister of State is spoiling things. Earlier we were getting on very well. He seems to have been needled by his right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) and now he feels he has to restore himself to favour in his right hon. Friend's estimation and therefore has to start needling back at us. We were hoping to make good progress on this Bill this morning. For the Minister of State to read into the remarks of myself and my hon. Friend the Member for Banff (Mr. W. H. K.

All we are talking about in this Clause is the question of an authority possessing powers of compulsory purchase. We are talking about a procedural matter, and because a procedural matter, which happens to come in under the Land Commission Act, in certain circumstances may have aspects which commend itself to us does not mean that automatically we commend the Land Commission itself. This is precisely the impression which the Minister of State was giving. I hope we may now proceed in a more co-operative and reasonable state of mind, because certainly nothing that I or my hon. Friend said this morning commended the principle of the Land Commission as being a body which will help the development of land in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>GROUNDS ON WHICH SECRETARY OF STATE MAY REFUSE TO CONFIRM PURCHASE NOTICE</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are now moving on to a part of this Bill which begins to discuss the question of planning blight. I appreciate that the main part of this is raised under Clause 33, yet in this Clause with which we are now dealing there is mention of one of the first factors concerning planning blight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As Members of the Committee will know, there are, in general, two kinds of planning blight: one which is referred to specifically in this Clause, and the other referred to later on. The first case of planning blight with which this Clause is concerned is when the owner of land suffers difficulty because of the refusal of planning permission and he is unable to have the beneficial use of his land. The second form is where land is blighted because it is included in development projects. This Clause deals with the limited case where an owner of land suffers because planning permission is refused. In those circumstances the owner of the land has the power to serve a purchase order on the authority concerned, and under this Clause the Secretary of State is given powers in certain circumstances to refuse confirmation of that purchase order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, this Clause widens the powers of the Secretary of State to refuse the purchase order. It gives him greater powers than those he has had under earlier legislation. This may be for good reasons, but it reduces the freedom of the private individual or the body whose land is affected, and it restricts the grounds on which it is possible to sustain the purchase order. Rather than raise now the wider issues of planning blight I would like to know why this extension of power is considered necessary, and in what circumstances it will be used.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must confess that I am a little disappointed with the hon. Gentleman, because in fact this Clause has nothing whatsoever to do with blight. It contains provisions for the right of
	<span class='label label-info column'>406</span>
refusal of planning permission. I am willing to go into the reasons why we have revised this; they are of comparatively recent origin, during the last ten years or so, and as a result of our experience of the working of the 1947 Act. I welcome what the hon. Gentleman has said about blight in the general sense, and will willingly discuss this on the next Clause, but I do not see how this Clause is as closely related to blight as the hon. Gentleman imagines.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that. I said that the main questions applied to Clause 33 and the later Clauses, but I am sure the hon. Gentleman must accept that this is a case where somebody suffers. "Blight" is a limited word, and I ask the indulgence of the Minister of State if I have widened the use of the word, because it can affect the rights of an individual in these circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Question is—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister of State has not explained the specific point. Laying aside the argument as to whether or not this constitutes blight, I would like to know why this Clause gives the Secretary of State extended powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought it would be charitable not to reply, but if the hon. Gentleman wants me to reply I will do so. The fact is that we are dealing with a Clause which concerns compensation for something one is prohibited from doing. It has nothing to do with blight. Blight is the diminution of value resulting from some kind of decision—some kind of broad, or even less distinct, proposal than this. This is a precise circumstance. We know why this action is being taken, and therefore we are dealing with compensation for something which one is not allowed to do. Blight is a different matter, and we will debate it on the succeeding Clauses. One cannot consider this Clause in any way as coming under the word "blight".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the technical arguments put forward, but if the Minister of State will refer to the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum he will see that it refers to Clause 32 as widening the grounds on which the Secretary of State may refuse to confirm a purchase notice. This is a matter akin to blight, and perhaps the Minister can
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1040">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>407</span>
tell us why these grounds are being widened.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an entirely different question, and if I had been asked that at the beginning I would have answered it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did ask it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The hon. Gentleman talked about blight, and that confused me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new provision put in here has been devised to rectify the anomaly shown up by the case of Adams and Wade, Ltd. v. the Minister of Housing and Local Government, among other examples. In that case a builder succeeded in making a local authority purchase part of a housing site which he had developed, subject to the condition, which everyone considered reasonable at that time, that the part should be left undeveloped for reasons of amenity. We have rectified this position, and the change in the Clause has been welcomed in other parts of the House and I thought it would be welcomed in this Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an English example and I should be interested to know whether there are any Scottish examples, and whether the Minister envisages this kind of thing arising there or whether it is a general safeguard for the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am advised that there are no cases of this abuse in Scotland. The English have taken power to make sure that this abuse does not continue, and it would be imprudent if we did not follow suit, because our builders could look up the case—and in view of this debate they will now know all about it—and then they would be able to exploit the situation. I am sure the hon. Gentleman would not want that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a textual Amendment which I would like the Committee to make; it was suggested to me by one of my hon. Friends. The word "district" is a word in the dictionary of local authority terms. It has a meaning, and despite what I said earlier about district councils being without power I think we should say what we mean and not by implication give it a local authority terminology which it does not merit. We are speaking of an area, not a district, and accordingly I would like these Amendments to be made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will be realised that these Clauses all run into one another, and perhaps if we could have a brief general debate on planning blight it might save time. I think the Minister could help the Committee and the public in Scotland by giving an explanation of the workings of these three Clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a possibility that the introduction of structural and local plans could increase planning blight, and this is something we want to avoid. As soon as the local authorities start drawing lines on maps, or even producing written statements, we are immediately developing planning blight. Some members of the public will suffer financial loss because of this, and it is something which all of us in this Committee want to minimise. Blight is blight, whether it is vague, or uncertain, or even probable, and we must try to reduce its effect through these Clauses. It is important that the public should know where they stand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Throughout this Bill, and throughout the passage of the English Bill, and the workings of the Planning Advisory Group, the whole idea has been to bring the public into participation in planning. I know that is a wonderful desire, and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1041">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>409</span>
perhaps it is going too far, but in individual cases the public must realise what their rights are and how they can deal with the situation. Some of this is affected later in the Bill by the powers of the statutory undertakers, but I hope this morning, in his usual lucid way, the Minister of State can set out the procedure he visualises the public taking, so that they know where they stand with regard to planning blight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hope there will be a lot of development in Scotland, in roads, and in the services—gas, electricity, and even the railways—the B.B.C., the Post Office, and so on. Because they are providing services all these statutory undertakers may well be causing planning blight, and it is up to the Minister to explain to the public just what their rights are in this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a natural concern on the part of the public that the great Juggernaut of the Government or of local authorities can overrule the man in the street who is trying to look after his own property and interest, and we hope this Bill will retain the right of the individual to look after his own interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire intends to make a contribution. We look forward to the wealth of his views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An extension of the grounds on which blight may be claimed is to be welcomed, because for many years the problems arising from blight have been recognised. In the 1947 Act the grounds were strictly limited in that they applied to the refusal of planning permission. An extension was made in the 1959 Act, which applied the provisions to any exercise of planning powers, but despite the general grounds on which planning blight has been recognised and provision made for it, there still exists a high degree of public disquiet about the matter. Concern is felt throughout the country, including my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sometimes blight cannot be technically defined as having taken place, although the person affected is either unable to sell his property or, if he can sell it, is able to obtain only a small part of its real worth. A case occurred in my constituency involving a lady who had invested her hard-earned savings in some property. At the time there was no knowledge of development occurring. We will discuss the question of compensation later, but this lady, because of blight, lost the value of her property and ended up with only the clear site value. While she had originally invested several thousands of pounds, she was finally able to obtain only £75. All concerned, including the town council which was acquiring the land, felt sympathy for her, but sympathy is not enough, and is not financial compensation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should appreciate that blight need not occur from a particular development, structure or local plan. An intention to develop can be enough to cause blight, even though that intention is not defined sufficiently to come within the grounds on which blight can be claimed. As my
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1042">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>411</span>
hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) pointed out, blight is blight whether it is vague or certain. I wish that there were a way to deal with marginal cases when blight cannot be defined but when people suffer financial loss.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I welcome this extension of the grounds for claiming blight I hope that the Minister will explain how subsection (1)(	<i>a</i>) will operate. The structure plans will be of a diagrammatic nature and will in many cases be difficult to comprehend by the average person. If a householder or landowner studies a diagrammatic plan he may immediately think that his property will be affected, and this will result in more work for the local planning authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am particularly concerned about the wider question of blight where there is uncertainty over whether there is an intention to develop rather than a precise plan. In this connection, there is increasing concern about the type of blight which occurs when property is not physically affected but when it adjoins a development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two good examples of this. The first is when an owner finds that his property is adjacent to a new Motorway. Although it does not cut through his land, he is subjected to the noise and other inconveniencies associated with that development. The second is when an owner finds his property adjacent to an airport. This may be an even greater problem these days with Concordes and sonic bangs. Although blight may not technically arise in such a case, his property may lose in value because of its proximity to the development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will give an explanation of how this part of the Bill will work. I do not pretend to have any real answers to the problems I have raised. However, it would help if we knew what intentions the Government have for dealing with marginal cases of blight which cause concern to many individuals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have great sympathy with the difficulties raised by the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) and I am particularly aware of them as a result of my connection with transport matters. I, too,
	<span class='label label-info column'>412</span>
hope that the Minister will amplify these provisions and say how they will affect the position of blight when land is acquired for, say, new road building.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much difficulty occurs when new roads divide small farms, and, in these circumstances, blight immediately sets in. In this connection, the appalling delays which occur between the announcement and the ability of the citizen to get to grips with the problem—and, if successful for compensation to be paid—are intolerable. It is possible for a feasibility study to be carried out on land, for boring to take place to examine the substructure and so on, without any notification having been given to the farming interests concerned. I appreciate that I am referring simply to feasibility studies, and that at a much later stage the Government must decide, in consultation with the local authorities, the routes of the new roads. However, the uncertainty which is caused at this early stage results in a deterioration in values, and if a farmer wishes to sell, for whatever the reason, he finds that he is in difficulty because everything is in the melting pot and there is uncertainty about possible road developments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to the steps proposed in the Clause, is any other remedial action being taken. particularly to achieve the acquisition of land more speedily? At present it can take three to five years to complete the transaction and the uncertainty which occurs about the routes of new roads is appalling. We must have an appeals procedure if we are to remain democratic but are the Government considering streamlining it in view of the anxiety that is caused when an intention to develop is announced? As hon. Gentlemen opposite are all for appeals and the rights of the individual, they should lend their voices to pointing out that greater blight can sometimes be caused by the present delays in our appeals procedure than from actual development.

In replying to the comments that have been made, I will divide the problem of blight into two parts; the blight which we regard as coming within the narrower sense of the 1959 Act—that was the most recent attempt to deal with the problem, although there were attempts made before that Measure—and the need to improve the position for claimants so that justice is done. Section 38 of the 1959 Act and the relevant parts of the Act thereafter are designed to provide justice for claimants.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This problem of blight was directed to the situation where the saleability of property has declined, as a result of planning proposals which may involve the compulsory acquisition of property. That is one definite ascertainable form of blight, and this Bill seeks in its provisions to improve on the provisions of Section 38 of the 1959 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What this Bill does not do is to deal with the depreciation in the value of property as a result of planning proposals or public works. That is what might be called injurious affection, and it is a very much wider and separate problem from that which is dealt with in this Bill. That is not to say that we are not at some future time going to deal with this matter, but it is too difficult to deal with it at his juncture. After all, our predecessors in office, and even ourselves in the 1945-51 Parliament, could find no satisfactory answer to this. It is quite right that in Scotland people can resort to common law to seek redress in relation to injurious affection. I believe that in England there are very ancient Statutes which are often used to seek redress, even partial redress, in this regard. But the problem is essentially one which remains in both countries and in Wales, and it is one which has to be tackled in a separate form. The Government are presently studying it, and I hope that we may be in a position to make a Statement about this in the not too distant future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith), in a flash of modesty, said that he did not know the answer to this problem, and it is very difficult to find a real answer because there are arguments for and against the various proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>414</span>
My hon. Friend the Member for Central Ayrshire, in his closing remarks, touched on the problem that, even when one is dealing with a direct action, the very fact that one is doing so and for quite legitimate reasons, causes a loss of money and of assets to other people who are placed in this secondary, indirect, but nevertheless disadvantageous position because of the first proposition not being settled satisfactorily, or being delayed for an inordinate time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Committee will accept from me, that it is the Government's intention to study the matter further. We have done a great deal of work on it so far, and we have had substantial submissions from different bodies and persons urging an extension of the provisions to deal with land injuriously affected by public development. We have also had counter-proposals, pointing out that the effect of public schemes on neighbouring property is not always injurious; it is sometimes advantageous. In determining this, perhaps the Government will take into account benevolences resulting from development as well as injuries resulting from development.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. G. D. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is this not covered by betterment levy and that sort of thing? In fact, the Government have taken steps to take away the betterment aspect, but they have not taken steps to provide for a worsening aspect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not accept that it is covered by betterment levy. This is a very complicated matter, and I am very glad, Mr. Brewis, that you are being indulgent in allowing us to deal with the secondary part which, strictly speaking, is not in the Bill, but which is very much alive. I am sure that hon. Gentlemen will not want to proceed with the rest of the provisions till I have made comments on this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of the fact that the betterment levy is being proposed for abolition, and in view of the fact that it could be modified, I do not know the answers to these questions. I could not fairly give to the Committee any reflection of what might be in a subsequent White Paper on this. But it is the Government's very firm intention that we will make recommendations of one kind or another, and will seek to take them into law. Just when that will be done, I cannot give
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1044">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>415</span>
an assurance this morning. But I want the Committee to accept from me, first of all, that a problem exists regarding the second part. It requires full examination and it is having that examination. The result of it could be a White Paper in some form, followed, I would hope, by legislation and this Government hope to sponsor that. That is as far as I can go this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reverting to the first part of the problem, which is definable, and which results from the improved provisions of the 1947 Act in the 1959 Act, I would point out that we are making an adjustment in Clause 33 to fit in with the changed style of development plans, with structure plans which comprise a written statement of policy, supported by diagrams and illustrations as the planning authority think appropriate, but not including a map on an Ordnance Survey base. The adaptation that we are putting in here is that the value of the property which begins to be affected is assessed from the earliest date at which the blighting proposals are regarded as firm; that is to say, when the Secretary of State approves a structure plan. So that we are taking it right back to the earliest point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After all, the Committee will remember that there a great deal of discussion has to go on as to what kind of structure plan the authority should submit to the Secretary of State. There is then a time at which a formal stage is reached, when representations are put to the authority by individual persons, and after that, the structure plan is perhaps put to the Secretary of State. In other words, there is a very extended area of debate when people's minds might be changed, and that is important. The important matter for an individual, in many cases, is not that he should get proper compensation for blight, but that he should seek to persuade authority that a development should not occur in a certain way. That is much more important to him than getting his money—at least in the case of most people. But I agree that if the argument were put on its head I would accept the other argument in certain cases. The disadvantage of this is that the longer there is after debate without commitment, then the longer a person is placed in this position. But I do not see how we can get out of this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>416</span>
What we have opted for, and what I thought this Committee agreed with—and the hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) emphasised this—is that we want genuine discussions, genuine dialogue, between the authority and the public, so that the authority does not feel it has lost face when it changes its view, and so that the public are confident that they genuinely can make representations to the authority to seek to have a structure or local plan altered. I think that this is what the majority of people affected by planning blight would choose. They would choose a longer time to seek to change an authority's mind, rather than securer provisions for proper compensation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a difficult matter, but what I am trying to say to the Committee is that, if we opt for that as distinct from the previous position, and it is asked whether the Minister will agree that the earliest official moment of approval is when blight begins, the answer is, "Yes". From the moment when the Secretary of State endorses a structure plan, we shall judge the beginning of blight.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to make a point about where the feasibility study starts. This should be hastened on, at any rate so far as roads are concerned, and they are my special interest this morning. Where feasibility studies are taking place, they are often very long drawn out over periods of years, and that is when deterioration sets in. Doubts set in and values begin to lower, because of the uncertainty. So if there is going to be a longer period allowed, with appeals coming along later, I hope that the feasibility studies and the preliminaries can be hastened. I want decisions made at an earlier stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend knows that subsection (1)(	<i>d</i>) says that where the
	<br><blockquote><p>"Secretary of State proposes to provide a trunk road or a special road and has given to the local planning authority written notice of his intention to provide the road"</p></blockquote>
then that is land qualifying for blight. I think that there are 32 steps to build a road, which take about four years, but once one has the line of the road settled then, of course, one knows what that is to be. My hon. Friend gave the classic argument at the end, that if one has a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1045">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>417</span>
proprietor who is fighting not a compulsory purchase but the line of the road, then some other proprietor is involved if the first one proves his case and the road is diverted. But how do we get out of this? It is very difficult till the line of the road is settled. I remember two good cases, where a diversion of the road threw into confusion someone who, prior to that, had been in the clear as regards the road; but the road was changed, because of a technical alteration resulting from an aerial survey and from borings to determine the line of the road, as well as other matters which arose from traffic studies. In other words, with the best will in the world it is very difficult to deal with this. But I accept that we should try very hard to get as near as we can to giving justice, and that means trying to reduce the element of time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To come back to Clause 33, the nearest one can come in dates for the benefit of the person who feels aggrieved is the date on which the endorsement by the Secretary of State of the structure plan is announced. I accept that that ought to be as quickly as possible after the submission to the Secretary of State by the authority, given that the authority has had preliminary discussions with the community over the nature of the structure plan to be submitted. In addition to this adaptation, the Clause extends the existing provisions by including, within the category of land in respect of which a notice to purchase may be served, land which is the subject of a confirmed compulsory purchase order, but in respect of which notice to treat has not been served. I thought that that would be a welcome addition. In Clause 34 we are extending these rights beyond the owner-occupiers and are including heritable creditors as well, and we are making other adjustments in succeeding Clauses. For example, in Clause 36 we have an adjustment dealing with land which qualifies for protection under Clause 33 in respect of which a compulsory order has been confirmed, but where no notice to treat has been served. In Clause 37 we are making five, admitedly small but useful, operational and financial improvements, mainly to the benefit of the claimant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not suggesting that these improvements are the last word in this very serious problem of trying to deal with
	<span class='label label-info column'>418</span>
blight. Hon. Gentlemen opposite made a very earnest attempt in 1959 to deal with it. They tried reasonably hard and their provisions succeeded, but not completely. We are proposing here several more amendments, but we shall have to look very closely at the operation of them if the Committee agrees to these Clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would emphasise, too, that it is very important that we should look at this major problem of how to deal with injurious affection; that is to say, those matters which are not included in the 1947 Act, in the 1959 Act or in this Bill. It will mean separate legislation, or legislation conjoined with other allied forms of legislation, in order to deal with injurious affection, but I hope it goes out to the public that, while we are seeking to improve the provisions in relation to blight where a person is directly affected, both sides of this Committee are of the view that we must take further steps regarding those indirectly affected by blight, and by the problem of injurious affection. That is not a party issue; it is one on which we can all agree.

	<span class='label label-info column'>419</span>
This is a perfectly simple probing Amendment which will not take more than a moment. Why is the power of the heritable creditor to serve a blight notice confined to one who can give immediate vacant possession? I am interested to know why it is not acceptable to all heritable creditors without this distinction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Clause extends the benefit of the blight provisions of the 1959 Act at present enjoyed by owner-occupiers to heritable creditors as well. It enables the heritable creditor of a property, the owner of which would be entitled to serve a blight notice, to serve such a notice in place of the owner, but only where the creditor is entitled to sell the property with vacant possession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we were to accept the Amendment it would remove that limitation. The Amendment would make it apply in all circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The basic principles underlying the blight provisions are that the benefits are not available to the owners of tenanted properties. The object of Clause 34(2) is to assist mortgagees in possession by putting them on the same footing as owner-occupiers so that where a mortgager has disappeared, defaulting on his debt and leaving the property empty and perhaps unsaleable, this situation is covered. It would be wrong to extend the benefit of blight provisions to all mortgagees. This is a principle which is in past legislation and one to which we should stick.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 186, in page 34, line 15, leave out subsection (1).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We now approach a matter of considerable importance, in this Amendment and also in Amendment No. 187, in page 34, line 24, leave out 'do not propose' and insert 'undertake not', which I would like to deal with separately but which is to a great extent a related matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Clause deals with the extension of grounds of objection to blight notice. We dislike it, that the service of blight notice can be objected to on the grounds that the authority does not propose to acquire any part of the hereditament—my hon. Friend the Member for Banff (Mr. W. H. K. Baker) has left the Committee. I was hoping to impress him with my pronunciation of that word—during the period of 15 years from the date of counter notice. On this side we object to this restriction to a period of 15 years. Does the Minister of State think this restriction in this subsection is fair? I ask him to consider the case of an owner who is selling his property
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1047">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>421</span>
and who can guarantee the use of that property to a prospective buyer for a period of only 15 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would also like him to consider that, even within that 15 years, there is no certainty, as this Clause stands at the moment—and this is touching on Amendment 187, which I will deal with in more detail in a moment—that the authority may not change its mind within that 15-year period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is quite competent for a blight notice to be served on account of a structure plan, so to that extent the intention of the authority may be quite clear. On the other hand in the actual putting into effect of the structure plan the authority may not propose to acquire that land under the structure plan for a period of 15 years. Therefore, whilst the intention of the authority may be quite clear in the structure plan, the actual carrying out of that intention may not take place within that 15-year period. I feel, there-more, that the owner of land or a house is to be in a certain invidious position so far as this subsection is concerned, with this restriction to a 15-year period.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are in a very difficult area of argument. The Opposition Amendment would stop the intention of this Clause and bring the situation back to its present position which I do not regard as satisfactory, and I am sure the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) might comment on that when he responds to me. We have a situation which is not acceptable to people just now, and I think this Amendment is an improvement on that situation, although this is, no doubt, a matter for argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Amendment is made then local authorities would be unable to state that they did not propose to acquire certain land within 15 years. This applies only to land affected by proposals in a structure plan for which there is no local plan; and to land indicated but not defined or allocated in a development plan as being required for a highway. So the 15-year counter notice is available only in respect of proposals which cannot by definition be shown in precision because of the nature of the plan or the proposal itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>422</span>
My hon. Friend the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel) was indicating earlier the problems regarding roads and how difficult it is to specify the line of the road because of the arguments there might be about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right to give the owner-occupier protection at the stage when the structure plan is approved and we have done that in Clause 33, but the diagrammatic nature of the plan and the supporting statement may lead to assumptions about areas which, when the details are finally worked out, will prove not to be liable to acquisition for many years, if ever. The local authority may be able to say it does not intend to acquire the property or does not intend to acquire it for at least 15 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have chosen 15 years as a reasonable period of time so that the service of a 15-year counter-notice should help to dispel blight from the affected property as well as freeing the property from premature or unnecessary acquisition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will not deal with Amendment No. 187, but I agree it is relevant to this. The hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns might argue that 15 years is too short and that an owner might be unable to sell his property at a reasonable price, but it will be in such a case that the authority may believe it is likely to want the property at some time. It cannot under Clause 33(2) use the 15-year counter-notice if it can say flatly that it does not want the land at all. The Clause tries to make provision to solve this problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the chief deterrent to prospective purchase will usually be the difficulty of borrowing on the property because normally the mortgagee will look to a 20-year expectation of life. That is why we have Clause 35(5) which enables the authority to advance money for the purchase of hereditaments. Local authorities are already able, under housing powers, to make advances to finance the purchase of homes. This provision makes provision for advances not only on residential property but, just as important, on business and agricultural premises. So this is an improvement on the present situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one says 14 years or 18 years should be the period, one is only pressing the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1048">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>423</span>
position to a degree that can be complained about one way or another. The period of 15 years is the best suggestion we have had. I do not think the Opposition want to strike this out and bring us back to the present situation which is not as good. I would suggest the Amendment be not made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister of State's explanation. Perhaps he would correct me if I am wrong in what I have understood. The real purpose of this subsection is to meet the very problem I raised earlier in the debate on Clause 33(1)(	<i>a</i>), where land is blighted as a result of a structure plan. This is extended to ground on which blight could be claimed. In Clause 33(1)(	<i>a</i>) blight is considered as having taken place where a property is affected by a structure plan. As I mentioned previously, now the structure plan is taken into account this could lead to very many people considering their property blighted, on account of the general nature of the structure plan. We are glad that there has been the extension in that case. It would seem that the purpose of Clause 35(1) is to try and reduce to some extent the number of cases under which these claims will be made, by limiting to 15 years the period under which the local authority may acquire that land. Because of the structure plan considerations there is going to be a great increase in the volume of work so far as blight notices are concerned. If it is going to make the position more practical I can see that there is reason behind this subsection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Could the Minister of State confirm whether I have understood this correctly? If so I would be prepared to consider withdrawing the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a matter of judgment. The hon. Gentleman has expressed it very well. The problem at the moment is that there is no 15-year rule. Therefore the person concerned has no idea whether a matter is going to be affected. If the authority knows it is not going to develop it ought to tell the person that; never mind the 15-year counter-notice. That would remove the problem of blight completely. If the authority can decide to do this and give a 15-year counter-
	<span class='label label-info column'>424</span>
notice, the property is of use, not only for housing but for business and commerce. It is possible that a business man who may be selling up or expanding in 10 year's time may be able to use the 15-year notice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not saying that 15 years is perfect, but all the advice we have been given is that on balance we are right in stating this time. I hope the hon. Gentleman does not want to proceed with his Amendment. This would throw the thing out. We would have no 15 years and would be back where we started with no time limit at all. Some people will welcome this from the claimant's point of view and some authorities will use this wisely. I have no doubt that there may be arguments about it, but anything one does in these Clauses is open to argument. It is Solomon's judgment all the time, trying to decide the right time to choose, and I feel that 15 years is the right figure. This provision reduces blight for a substantial period where there has been uncertainty, and would be uncertainty if we were to adopt the Amendment. I hope the hon. Gentleman is able to see that on balance it is a good proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 187, in page 34, line 24, leave out 'do not propose' and insert 'undertake not'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having withdrawn my previous Amendment I feel that that adds even greater strength to this Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the problems of Clause 35(1) is that it creates a feeling of uncertainty for a person who thinks his property has been blighted but is unable to serve a blight notice because the local authority says it does not intend to acquire the land for 15 years. I would like to write into the Bill that the local authority must undertake not to purchase that land in the period of 15 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Bill stands there is no certainty that the authority may not change its mind within the 15-year period. Under this subsection, if the local authority says it does not propose to acquire that land in the 15-year period, we are taking away from the person who feels aggrieved the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1049">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>425</span>
right to apply for a blight notice, yet we are giving him no certainty that the local authority will abide by what it says it is going to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this Amendment we introduce an element of certainty, even though it is confined to a period of 15 years. If the intention of the local authority had been applied to an unlimited period, if we did not have this 15-year restriction, I would be prepared to accept that the words "do not propose" might be appropriate, but when we are writing in a limited period of years there is need for this Amendment and to lay an obligation on the local authority to give a more definite undertaking. I hope the Minister of State will consider accepting the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another matter. In the case of a proposal not to acquire being violated, which could happen if the words "do not propose" stand in the Bill, I believe there ought to be compensation for the person who finds that the local authority does, in the locut acquire the land within the 15-year period. There may be cases of an individual owning property and told he cannot serve a blight notice because the local authority does not propose to acquire the land for 15 years. If that assurance is violated he could suffer loss. In the 15-year period he may be forced to sell for Estate Duty reasons or capital gains purposes, he may have to retire from business, or he may have other reasons. In those circumstances, as the Bill stands, with the words "do not propose", I would like to ask the Minister of State whether there should not be some element of compensation in the event of the 15-year period being violated. If the Amendment is accepted the question of compensation falls, because the person will have had a definite undertaking. If the Amendment is not accepted the Minister has to look at the question of compensation where a person suffers loss.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman was very clear in moving that Amendment. He asked if I could not see my way to accept the Amendment, would I look at the question of compensation. Certainly I agree that if a local authority irresponsibly, or responsibly because it felt there should be a change of policy, were to go ahead with development, the person
	<span class='label label-info column'>426</span>
might suffer loss. There would, however, be a reference to arbitration by the party concerned who served the blight notice. If the hon. Gentleman looks at Clause 101—and we know the automatic operation of the lands compensation machinery as well—that answers the point about anyone who is dealt with unfairly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Returning to the argument about the use of the words—and I am not using this as a party argument—under the 1959 Act the words were left as "do not propose". If the words had been changed then, it would have meant that councillors operating the Act in 1959 would have dictated matters in 1974. Consider what has happened in our own localities since 1959. There have been remarkable changes of intention, not wicked intention but intention' genuinely (to meet the changing demands of road developments, industrial zonings, housing and many other changes. Is it fair to bind councillors serving on councils now or the councillors of 1974, not yet elected, when there will be an immense landslide for Labour—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should not be too optimistic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact is that it is unfair to impose on the councillors of 1974 what the councillors of 1959 think. In that space of time, 15 years, we shall have seen a remarkable revolution in the roads programme. We have doubled the roads programme in the last four years. The Conservative Party started in 1962 and 1963 to inaugurate a roads programme nearly worthy of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But have a look at taxation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman wants roads but does not want to pay for them. His party, even though he has changed his mind, argued for a higher roads programme under Chancellor Maudling in 1963 and 1964. Thank goodness they did. We have doubled that performance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am suggesting that, because of these changes of policy, it is unfair to impose on the councillors of later years the decisions of earlier councillors. We are talking of 15 years, so I suggest to the Committee that the only abuse of this
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1050">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>427</span>
could be if a local authority acted irresponsibly. If it acts genuinely in the public interest that matter is dealt with, and the person concerned will not be so aggrieved as he will know that there is a genuine reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I come back to the first point? There is adequate provision for compensation in those circumstances, both under Clause 101 and under the normal compensating procedures, but I am putting to the Committee that it is unreal to say "undertake not" in 15 years. What happens if there is an essential matter of public policy which no one could anticipate? This is putting oneself in a strait-jacket. I confess that my prejudices are in favour of the individual affected by this development, and so it would be wrong to put the whole area in jeopardy because we had included this proviso "undertake not".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. A. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask what the legal position is? If a council changes, is it bound by a decision of the previous council, or can it change the policy even if these words are put in? I think the real question is that of compensation, and not of the council being bound.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that, unfortunately, it is legally bound as a corporate body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, the local authorities have not been consulted about this Amendment, and I believe they would be alarmed, because I do not believe any local council would be happy about giving an undertaking not to do something. It would want to find another way of avoiding a situation which could only be to the detriment of the person affected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important matter. I am concerned with people who buy houses, and who do this on the understanding that the houses will have 15 years of life. They are placed in a difficult position if at the end of the day the period is only five years. This difficulty has not been satisfactorily resolved. I agree with my hon. Friend that it is difficult for a local authority to bind itself. I have had experience of several cases where people have suffered financially, and they were ordinary working people who could ill afford it. It seems
	<span class='label label-info column'>428</span>
to me that somehow or other we should endeavour to give them as long notice as possible. The period of 15 years is a decided improvement. In Edinburgh at the present time they would not divulge the plans for five years ahead, but they say, "We have no proposals at the present time for the next 10 years". We have to reconcile these two interests, and I am not altogether happy that we have in fact done this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have thought this out quite extensively, but frankly, I would say to the Committee that it does not matter how one approaches these Clauses; one is faced with dilemmas all along the way. If we write in the words "undertake not" I suggest that few councils will operate the 15-year notice. They will not commit themselves to doing that, and therefore, much as they would like to give the individual a guarantee for 15 years, they dare not do it, because they will not know what they will be doing in 15 years' time themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I personally favour putting in a 15-year notice. The local authorities have consented to this, and what I ask is whether it will be operated in the spirit in which we want it to be operated. I am sure those who know the local councils well will agree that they will tend to use the provision advantageously to the person concerned if the wording at present in the Bill stands. I believe the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) has accepted the value of the 15-year system. He has accepted that on balance the merits outweigh the demerits, and presumably he will want to see it operating as extensively as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course there is an element of balance in both this Amendment and the previous Amendment, and it is a matter of judgment on which side one happens to come down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister gave us an explanation, but in the middle of it he said he did not want to raise any party political points and then proceeded to raise a lot of political arguments about roads, and the moment he has to resort to political arguments it usually means he is on rather weak ground and I become suspicious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For that reason, on balance, I feel that the Clause as it stands puts the matter
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1051">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>429</span>
in favour of the local authorities and against the private individual. I would like to redress the balance and put it more in favour of the individual person or business. For that reason I ask my</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>COMPENSATION FOR COMPULSORY PURCHASE OF LAND IN CLEARANCE AREAS AND OF HISTORIC BUILDINGS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This Clause is an important one which applies to the compensation to be paid in the event of compulsory purchase of the land in clearance areas. The Clause extends to the whole of Part III of the Housing Act, 1966, and in particular to the minimum compensation provisions contained in Section 47 of that Act. In other words, the compensation payable in a clearance area is to be at the site value. As every Member of this Committee knows, in many cases the site value is a matter which is extremely marginal. I referred to this earlier when dealing with the question of blight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One understands the historical reason why it was put at site value, which, I gather, was to prevent clearance speculators from coming in to clearance areas and hoping for large compensation in respect of unfit houses. I do not quibble at that provision for a moment, but there are many people who bought what they thought was a reasonable house, only to find that, in a clearance area, when the
	<span class='label label-info column'>430</span>
hon. Friends to support me in pressing this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the Amendment be made:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 8, Noes 14.</p>
	<p>compensation is assessed, it is absolutely minimal, and in those circumstances hardship can result. There are many unfair cases, such as the case I quoted earlier this morning.</p>
	<p>In the Housing Bill, which we hope to be considering shortly, we have the definition of "housing treatment areas" which is akin to the question of clearance areas. In Clause 11 of the Housing Bill there is provision for special payments which can be made in respect of well maintained houses. Also in Clauses 18 and 19 of that Bill there are further discretionary payments which can be made, but in that case they are confined to owner-occupiers of two years' standing.</p>
	<p>At this time it would be wrong to enter into a debate on housing treatment areas and the question of discretionary payments. Doubtless there will be lengthy debates on that when the time comes, but now I will merely point out how often there is hardship as a result of the site value payments. We try to avoid exploitation on the one hand, but on the other hand we have to avoid hardship, and I should like to know how the treatment areas in the Housing Bill fit in with the clearance areas in this Clause, and also whether the Minister of State is satisfied with the compensation provisions which exist at the moment, or whether he thinks the additional provisions in the Housing Bill will redress some of the present difficulties.</p>
	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>

(Scotland) Bill next Tuesday, which would please me greatly, and I would be prepared to have a discussion of site values even on the Question, That Clause 1 stand part of the Bill. That cannot take place now, particularly since it is a complex matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing a straightforward and simple Clause. It seeks to prevent those owners of land which qualifies for protection under Clause 33(1)(	<i>c</i>)—that is, land in respect of which a compulsory order has been confirmed but about which no notice to treat has been served—from gaining an anomalous financial advantage by intervening with a purchase notice under the blight provisions in order to claim higher compensation than would be payable following the service of a notice to treat under a compulsory purchase order. Compensation in respect of an acquisition under the blight provisions is assessed at full market value without regard to the depreciating effect of the planning proposals which have given rise to the blight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions in paragraphs (a) and (	<i>b</i>) are in respect of historic buildings and in respect of compulsory purchase orders made under the Housing (Scotland) Act, 1966. In the first case, the interest is one in respect of which a compulsory purchase order is in force under Section 1 of the Acquisition of Land (Authorisation Procedure) (Scotland) Act, 1947, which sets out the procedure for the compulsory acquisition of land, as applied by Clause 49 of the Bill, which deals with the acquisition of buildings which have been listed as being of architectural or of historic interest, and the Minister has given a direction under Clause 52 of the Bill that minimum compensation shall be paid because he is satisfied that the building has been deliberately allowed to fall into disrepair in order to justify its demolition. In such a case, notwithstanding that the property is acquired under the blight provisions, compensation is to be assessed in accordance with Clause 52(4) of the Bill, which provides that it is to be assumed that planning permission would not be granted for any development or redevelopment of the site of the building and that consent under Clause 39—which the noble Lord is dead keen to get to—would not be granted for any of the works requiring consent under that Clause, other than works
	<span class='label label-info column'>432</span>
necessary for restoring the building to a proper state of repair and keeping it in that state.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will not elaborate the details of the second case, which are appreciated. It will be agreed that an owner of land should not be placed in the sort of advantageous position that I have described by being able to come in with a purchase order and thereby get better compensation. That would be a type of abuse which no hon. Member would condone.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
On reflection, I do not consider this subsection to be necessary. The Clause makes a number of miscellaneous amendments to the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act, 1959, and this subsection provides that the power to make orders under Section 38(4)(a) of the 1959 Act should be exercisable by statutory instrument and subject to the negative resolution procedure.

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We would like an explanation, however brief, why it is necessary for the Clause to be in the Bill. Although it refers to the disposal of land, it seems to relate entirely to housing. At present, I understand the situation to be that in certain circumstances a local
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1053">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>433</span>
authority in Scotland may sell one of its council houses without having to seek the approval of the Secretary of State. If, for example, a local authority has built a house which is new, and has not been occupied or used for housing needs purposes, it does not need to ask the Secretary of State for his approval before selling it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the effect of this provision be that in future no housing accommodation belonging to a local authority may be sold without the approval of the Secretary of State? If that is not so, and if the Clause is not designed to cover all possible sales by a local authority, in what circumstances will discretion still be left to local authorities to sell houses without seeking the approval of the Secretary of State?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must know the answer to this question before we can comment further on the Clause. We must know the intentions of the Government on this matter. Why are they seeking to alter the present situation, and to what extent do they intend to extend the requirement to seek the approval of the Secretary of State?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a technical Clause which clarifies the position without changing the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act, 1959. It is a clarifying amendment which makes it clear beyond doubt that the Secretary of State has power to control the sale by local authorities of subsidised houses. This is a power which hon. Gentlemen opposite preserved when they were in office. I cannot give the figures of how often they used it. In the last year seven local authorities sought consent to sell 41 houses in Scotland and consent was given in respect of 11 houses, which shows that the Secretary of State does not always say "No". However, he has power to say "No", and while I will not go at length into the matter, I appreciate the policy of the Conservative Party on this issue, even though I do not agree with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not consider it a right and prudent use of public money to sell council houses where there is a need for rented accommodation in the area of the local authority concerned. If the house is vacant, its sale results in a reduction of
	<span class='label label-info column'>434</span>
the pool of houses available for letting. If it is sold to a sitting tenant, this result is delayed, but there is an ultimate reduction in the pool of tenanted houses. There are certain areas of Scotland which meet the Secretary of State's criteria; that is, there is no longer a need for rented accommodation in the area. This proved to be so in respect of 11 houses, most of which are in Highland authority areas; but there are some exceptions to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second criterion is, if the house does not form part of the local authority's general pool of rented houses or is not suitable for that purpose; for example, houses which were built to meet a special need which no longer exists or houses of a special type. We gave consent for the sale of a house in the Royal Mile of Edinburgh. It was to be let at a competitive rent and to be part of a special scheme. We do not have a doctrinaire view on this question. Nor does the Conservative Party. To hold such a view—to say that no such houses should be sold or that they should all be sold—would be absurd. Both parties agree that there should be a restriction, although, perhaps, we take a more definitive view of this than hon. Gentlemen opposite.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Clause is designed simply to make sure that there can be no circumvention by a local authority of the right of the Secretary of State to say "No". This right is contained in Section 145(6) of the Housing (Scotland) Act, 1966. We are not changing the position but simply strengthening it, remembering that it is a position with which hon. Gentlemen opposite have agreed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. G. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister's explanation of the Clause, because it is now easier for us to comment on the provision. He said that it is intended to clarify the fact that the Secretary of State's approval must be sought in all cases where it is proposed to sell a council house which has been subsidised. Presumably, therefore, it will not apply to cases where a council house has been built but has not been subsidised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will deal with the subsidised type of house first. I had an Adjournment debate on this issue some time ago, and, since the Minister of State replied to that, I need not go at length into what is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1054">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>435</span>
happening in Scotland in this connection and what has been the position until recently. Councils have been applying in individual cases where subsidised houses were concerned and until about two years ago the Secretary of State was, on the whole, giving his approval in those individual cases on their merits. However, about two years ago he seemed to close down on precisely similar houses. He refused permission even for the house next door in certain instances, although the circumstances were exactly the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will not repeat that debate now, except to point out that there are cases—I agree that each must be considered on its merits—where the council, from a financial point of view, and, therefore, the ratepayers, and the tenant to whom the house is being sold, and people waiting on the housing list, can all benefit because the purchaser, if he is paying in cash, is providing money which is much required these days and which can be made available for further house building. This is why those on the housing list benefit and why no difficulty arises because the tenant remains in the house and is not pushed out. More building can be done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Lawson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At higher cost? Is that what the hon. Member is going to say?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not go into the details at this stage. In the past the Secretary of State has given his approval in individual cases, while in others he has refused. That is the position applying to subsidised houses. In Scotland the Secretary of State's approval has, in the past, been given where he has seen the advantages in giving it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now come to those cases where the approval of the Secretary of State has up to now not been required, because a house has not been built to meet housing needs and has not been subsidised. An example in the planning sphere is where a road widening scheme has been carried out as part of a development plan and has meant some houses being demolished. The council has replaced them with new houses and has then had to decide whether or not to sell them to the original owners of the houses which were knocked down. Until now a local authority has been able to sell such a house—I am referring to a new house; I know of cases
	<span class='label label-info column'>436</span>
of this kind—to the person whose house was demolished without seeking the approval of the Secretary of State. Alternatively, the council could sell it to some other person who was not the original owner of the house which was demolished, who might have moved elsewhere. Will such a case be covered by the Clause? Until now it has not been necessary for a council to seek the permission of the Secretary of State in such a case. A council could build new houses and sell them without his approval.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of Order. Are you aware, Mr. Brewis, that the Minister said that the Clause did not make any change in the law but simply gatheered together the various powers in one provision? That being so, is not a lot of this debate out of order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order. You will be aware, Mr. Brewis, that the Minister began his reply by referring to subsidised housing. He failed to comment on the position of un-subsidised housing. I was grateful for his explanation, but he did not reply to my query whether the Clause applied to housing that was not subsidised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does that explanation satisfy the right hon. Member?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that event, the debate may continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems that my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) is on the ball this morning. I obviously misled him because I did not intend to give the impression that the Clause gathered all these matters together in one provision. I said that we were making sure that a local authority could not use Section 166 of the 1947 Act or a Local Act to subvert the Secretary of State's right to say "No" about the sale of houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I confirm that we are dealing with all types of housing. A house which is subsidised, but in respect of which the first subsidy payment has not been made, is also covered. That provision makes the position clear. Both political parties have operated this provision, and I think it right and proper that this control should exist. I will not go into the figures
