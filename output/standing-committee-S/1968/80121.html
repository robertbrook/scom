<div class='page-header'><h1>TOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING (SCOTLAND) BILL [<i>Lords</i>]</h1></div>
<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
<p><i>Resolved,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That during the proceedings on the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Bill [<i>Lords</i>] the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock.â€”[<i>Dr. Dickson Mabon.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Dr. J. Dickson Mabon)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee have considered the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Bill [<i>Lords</i>] in relation to the principle of the Bill.</p></blockquote>
May I preface my remarks by welcoming you to our proceedings today, Sir Beresford. As a fellow Scot we know that you will take a keen interest in what we are debating, both now and later, and I am certain that, knowing Scotsmen, you will make sure that we do not get involved in too many heated arguments.<br><br>
It is a particular pleasure to me to introduce this Bill. My first love as a Minister was housing. I very soon found that housing programmes were doomed to frustration unless land use planning had been effectively done well in advance. With the passage of time I have found myself more and more deeply involved in land use matters all over Scotland and more and more convinced of the importance of us all asking the right land use questions at the right timeâ€”and if the question is addressed to me, of producing good answers based on systematic analysis.<br><br>
This Bill is long and complex. Its main purpose, however, is simple: to enable the public to take a constructive part in the planning debate at each stage, while at the same time providing for local planning authorities and Ministers to proceed systematically from the general to the particular in development planning, and to distinguish strategy from tactics. The many detailed provisions
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
tidying up existing procedures are subsidiary to this.<br><br>
Before I go on to the specific provisions I think I should deal with two general points. An article in <i>The Scotsman</i> some time ago complained that this Bill followed too closely its English equivalent without enough regard for special Scottish conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. T. G. D. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Dickson Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Some hon. Members may sympathise with this view, as does the hon. Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith). We must, of course, have a separate Scottish Bill. The previous administration in which the hon. Gentleman was an Under-Secretary of State for Scotland in 1959 were so indiscreet as to foist upon Scotland a Great Britain Bill, but were compelled to re-enact it in Scottish form, so that Scottish practitioners could conveniently handle and understand it. But there has never been a significant difference in planning legislation between England and Scotland. Administrations of both complexions since the war have, when legislating on planning, produced almost identical Measures for the two countries.<br><br>
If there have been arguments during the long period since 1947 to the effect that the system set up by the Act of that year was wrong for Scotland, rather than merely becoming out of date for Great Britain, I have not heard them. On the other hand, if it has made sense during the last 21 years to have basically the same planning system operating in both Scotland and England, I am not clear what circumstances have arisen recently to suggest that the two countries should have quite different planning systems.<br><br>
The truth is that essentially the same machinery is likely to be good for efficient planning in both Scotland and England unless we propose either to give radically different responsibilities to local planning authorities in one country as against another, or to vary the extent to which, and the manner in which, development is controlled in the two countries. I presume no one is going to suggest either of these things. I agree that there is scope for difference in detail. Hence a separate Scottish Bill. There will be room enough for debate about
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0074">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
detail in Committee. The right approach is for use to join with our English colleagues in conceiving major changes. This was done in this case.<br><br>
This Bill has its origin in a Report entitled "The Future of Development Plans" made by the Planning Advisory Group as long ago as 1965. The Group was drawn from both sides of the Borderâ€”of its 20 members four were from Scotlandâ€”and its Report was as relevant to Scotland as to England and did, in fact, arouse considerable interest in Scotland. I must acknowledge that, though the Group reported under the aegis of this Government, it was set up by the previous Administration, who presumably envisaged that its ultimate result would be closely similar legislation for Scotland and England.<br><br>
We have wasted no time. We gave a reasonable period for consideration of the P.A.G. report, then from 1966 had it discussed exhaustively by a Joint Working Party drawn from the Scottish Development Department and the local authority Associations, and this led, amongst other things, to a general conference of local authorities in Edinburgh early in 1967. Perhaps I might be forgiven for remarking that on the occasion of that conference I referred to the need for legislation and predicted that new legislation would take about two years to prepare.<br><br>
It has been argued that it is wrong to introduce a new planning system significantly altering the distribution of responsibility between the Secretary of State and local government in advance of local government reorganisation. This is referred to in an article in <i>The Glasgow Herald this</i> morning.<br><br>
The Government do not agree. It is no secret that the introduction of the new development plan system envisaged in this Bill will be gradual. I do agree that it will very probably not be completed till local government reorganisation takes place. But should this time be lost? This Bill is adaptable to a variety of local government structures. There are certainly authorities already existing who could usefully apply its provisions, and there is no merit in holding up for several years new style plans in areas where they can
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
be effectively prepared soon, and are urgently needed. Among other things, this will give us valuable experience of the administrative working of the new system, before the start of the massive task of local government reorganisation. If anyone is interested in a practical example, I can think of no better one than the meetings which we have had in Lanarkshire, and the decisions announced on Friday by myself on behalf of the Government in relation to them.<br><br>
I apologise for this rather long introduction, but I felt it was necessary to set the Bill in its background. I turn now to the detailed content of the Bill.<br><br>
Part I, Clauses 1 to 14, is, of course, the most important part. It embodies the fundamental change proposed in the planning system, namely, the replacement of the old style development plan by two new types of plan. Those are, first, a structure plan, which will consist of a written statement with appropriate illustrations, and which will set forth policy and proposals; and second, local plans, which will roughly resemble current development plans in form.<br><br>
Only the structure plan will normally require to be submitted to the Secretary of State for his approval. Local plans will, after new processes of public inquiry into objections on the same lines as obtains at present, be adopted by the local planning authority without reference to the Secretary of State unless that is specially called for.<br><br>
Some concern has been expressed about the principle of giving of power to local authorities to make and adopt their own plans. It has been thought that this is tantamount to making the planning authority judge and jury in its own cause. To some extent this difficulty is unavoidable in policy matters. Sometimes the Secretary of State finds himself in this position. It may be argued that that happens only rarely and is inevitable, and that there is no need to add instances of public authorities judging their own case by putting local planning authorities in this position when the Secretary of State is available to act as appellate authority. This argument has to be put in the context of up-to-date views on the distribution of responsibility between the Secretary of State and local government and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0075">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
on the delays, sometimes very considerable and to the detriment of the local public, experienced in the operating of the present planning machinery.<br><br>
We cannot expect to maintain the repute and value of local authority work, or to achieve expeditious planning if the Secretary of State is to be involved in every element of every development plan no matter how minute. Let us remember that local planning authorities will not be operating in a vacuum. They can prepare local plans only within the framework of a structure plan which will have been approved by the Secretary of State, and if there are signs that a particular local authority is disregarding that structure plan in framing its local plans, then the Secretary of State can call in these local plans for his own attention.<br><br>
Further, the Bill contains ample, and, indeed, substantially more, effective safeguards for the rights of the public than exist under the present dispensation. In particular, the important provisions in Clauses 3 and 7, which require publicity to be given to plans at an early stage and enable requirements to be laid down to ensure the participation of the public in the formation of development plans, will ensure that public opinion can be brought to bear on plans from the earliest possible stage. Under the new system there will be no place for the preparation of plans behind closed doors, leading to situations in which either a virtual <i>fait accompli</i> must be accepted, or major rearguard actions have to be fought with all that means in terms of expense and delay.<br><br>
And if, after all this, representations made against a plan are not withdrawn there must be a public inquiry held by a person either appointed by the Secretary of State or appointed in accordance with requirements laid down by the Secretary of State. As a final safeguard it will always be open to the Secretary of State to call in a local plan for his own decision if for any reasons at all he thinks it expedient to do so.<br><br>
Part II of the Bill deals with the enforcement of planning control. The existing provision for enforcement in Scotland allows an unauthorised use of land to be made the subject of enforcement action at any time up to two years
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
after its discovery. After the two years have elapsed it becomes immune. For a variety of reasons this provision has not worked very successfully, and what is proposed in the Bill is that in future this immunity will be abolished except in a limited number of special cases. In these exceptional cases the immunity will be gained not two years after discovery but four years after inception of the use; this we think is a more practical form of control.<br><br>
Other charges in this Part of the Bill include the institution of certificates of established use to deal with cases of possible uncertainty created by the fact that enforcement will now be possible for an indefinite period; the replacement of the sheriff by the Secretary of State as appellate authority for enforcement; and provision for the issue of what are called "stop notices" to enable the local authority to require constructional work to cease on unauthorised development so as to prevent the offence from being made more difficult to rectify while the issues are being threshed out.<br><br>
Part III of the Bill provides new machinery for dealing with planning appeals. In brief, the Secretary of State is empowered to delegate the right of deciding appeals of classes which are to be specified by him to persons he appoints for this purpose. This is not a power that we foresee any need to use at an early date in Scotland. The number of appeals decisions averages only about 200 a year, and it has been found convenient and practical to deal with this small volume with the help of a panel of part-time reporters, whose work is, I think, highly respected.<br><br>
The delegation envisaged in the Bill would require the creation in Scotland of a full-time trained body of inspectors such as already exists in England. At present we do not see a justification for this, but it is desirable to provide the power of delegation so that, if there is a sharp increase in the numbers of planning appeals of a routine character, there will be available a means of dealing with these expeditiously.<br><br>
Part IV of the Bill is concerned with land transactions. The main point here is that the designation of land in development plans as being subject to compulsory acquisition is abolished. This
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0076">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
particular provision has never proved of real value. In practice it has merely acted as an extra piece of administration added to the already complex procedures attending upon compulsory purchase. The planning purposes for which land may be compulsorily acquired are restated in Clause 28 to accord with the new form and objectives of development plans.<br><br>
This Part of the Bill also makes good an undertaking given to local authorities at the time of the Land Commission Act, 1967, by extending to them the general vesting declaration procedure available to the Land Commission. It also adjusts the provisions for the purchase of land blighted by planning proposals to take account of the new development plan system.<br><br>
Part V of the Bill makes new provision for the protection and preservation of buildings of special architectural or historic interest. The main change contemplated is that in future the listing of buildings will have the effect of requiring express consent for the demolition, alteration or extension of the buildings in question. It is as if a blanket building preservation order were being applied to all listed buildings, and perhaps one or two hon. Members may be satisfied with that proposal.<br><br>
Another valuable provision in this Part of the Billâ€”in Clause 52â€”is the power to restrict compensation payable on the compulsory acquisition of a listed building if it can be shown that the building has been deliberately allowed to fall into disrepair because the owner had his eye on the redevlopment of the site.<br><br>
10.45 a.m.<br><br>
I should also mention a change which we are proposing in the procedure for statutory listing of buildings. At present it is a requirement that the lists should be recorded in the Register of Sasines. This requirement has seriously hampered progress and it is being repealed in Schedule 10 to the Bill. In future the listing will be effected through lists deposited with local planning authorities. This will mean a very substantial saving in both time and manpower, and should enable statutory lists to be completed for the whole of Scotland within the next two years.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
Part VI of the Bill includes a large number of miscellaneous and desirable provisions on which I need not, perhaps, dwell for too long.<br><br>
Clauses 60 to 62 deal with the appointment of Planning Inquiry Commissions to enable proposed developments of exceptional importance or presenting very special and unusual features to be considered more exhaustively than is possible under the present system.<br><br>
Clause 63 authorises local planning authorities to delegate certain of their functions to their officials. This provision results from a management study of development control which revealed that many planning decisions were substantively reached by officials, without harm, and that a lot of time could be saved by recognising this. The degree to which delegation is given and the conditions to which it is subject are in the hands of the local authority itself and the Clause includes ample safeguards against abuse.<br><br>
Clauses 64 to 67 impose on all existing and future planning permission a five-year time limit causing the permission to expire if it has not been used. The purpose of this is to avoid the build-up of unused planning permission which can falsify the whole development plan picture and act as a deterrent to granting permission for development proposals.<br><br>
Clause 68 abolishes the payment of compensation in many circumstances for statutory undertakers if their development of land is refused or subjected to conditions.<br><br>
Clause 75 calls for the posting of notices on land in the case of planning applications for those types of development which experience has shown to be the most likely to be controversial.<br><br>
Perhaps I have now said enough to give the Committee a fair picture of the character and content of this Bill. It enjoys, I believe, the general support of local authority and professional planning opinion in Scotland. In mentioning that I would not wish to suggest that we are by any means opposed to suggestions for its improvement. On the contrary, the Government have themselves Amendments in mind, some of them in the light of representations received since the Scottish Bill was published, and we shall keep
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0077">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
an open mind towards any further suggestions for its improvement that may be made.<br><br>
I have deliberately curtailed my remarks because I realise the importance of the debate this morning and on Thursday, but I hope that I may be given some time on Thursday to reply in detail to criticisms which my hon. Friends and hon. Gentlemen opposite may make. As I say, we shall keep an open mind towards any further suggestions for the improvement of the Bill that may be made either now or in Committee. This is essentially another modernisation Measure from a great modernising Government. I ask the Committee this morning to approve its Second Reading.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before I propose the Question, I have a fairly long list of hon. Members who wish to speak. As I should like to call as many as possible, I would be grateful if, and respectfully hope that, hon. Members will keep their speeches as short as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. N. R. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a Bill which, in my view, and I think perhaps the Minister of State will agree with me, is of great significance and is one of the most important pieces of legislation which this Committee has been asked to consider. Just as the 1947 Act set the pattern of development in Scotland over a period of 20 years or so, so it may well be that this legislation will influence the pattern of town and country planning development in Scotland possibly for the remaining years of this century.<br><br>
It is generally recognised that substantial and indeed fundamental changes in the 1947 system are now called for. That Act was an Act which proceeded on the basis of the experience and thought of successive Governments and on the recommendations of the Barlow Committee which had been set up as long before as 1937. Apart from the Socialist overtones which were incorporated into the Bill, which is how I regard the Central Land Board system and the expropriation of all development value, which proved unworkable and had to be repealed, that legislation has performed a crucial rÃ´le in the immediate and massive postwar development of Scotland. The thesis of the Barlow Report was that planning had become a national rather than a local problem, and,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
in my submission, this thesis holds good today.<br><br>
I will briefly refer to some of the weaknesses in the 1947 legislation in order that we may assess the proposals in the present Bill, many of which are commendable. Whereas the original intention under the 1947 Act was that land use allocation maps should be drawn with a broad brush, anyone familiar with the operation of the system will appreciate that there was a growing tendency, prompted partly by statutory definition and partly by the notational technique subsequently adopted, towards greater detail and precision. As a result of that tendency, flexibility in planning tended to suffer.<br><br>
The emphasis under the 1947 Act was on land use allocation and requirements, and insufficient emphasis was placed on the traffic problems generated by that use. One recognises that traffic problems, as we know them today, were a phenomenon which developed in the postwar years, particularly after 1950.<br><br>
Another factor which developed in postwar years and which, I thought, cast doubt on the validity of the 1947 Act, was the gradual emergence of regional planning and infrastructural planning. The effect of that development tended to supersede the efficacy of the town and county maps as adequate bases on which to determine population and employment patterns. There was statutory provision in the 1947 Act both for voluntary combinations and for compulsory amalgamations of local authorities, but the former have rarely been exercised, and, so far as I am aware, the latter, compulsory amalgamations, have never been exercised.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Baxter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have been following with great interest what the hon. and learned Gentleman has said, but is there any provision in the Bill whereby there will be compulsory amalgamations or methods of making local authorities for two or three areas co-operate on a general plan? I have read the Bill, and I see no compulsory powers, here any more than there were under the 1947 Act.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to that. I would say in passing that the provisions of Section 2 and Schedule 1 of the 1947 Act remain unrepealed and there is,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0078">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
therefore, no need for further provisions in this Bill. This is a problem involving the operation of the system which is proposed in the Bill, and I will come to that in a moment.<br><br>
There was also inadequate provision in the 1947 legislation for consultation between local planning authorities. There are statutory regulations requiring consultation between local planning authorities where their development is perimeter development bordering on that of an adjoining local authority, but that statutory requirement tended to be inadequate, and, implicit in the whole approach to planning today, there is the regional concept. Unless one gets either co-operation and consultation or, preferably, a new unit of planning administration, then the desirable principles of this legislation may be more difficult to effect.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. W. Baxter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It appears to me to be quite reasonable that there should be some power to ensure a larger degree of regionalisation, but where is it stipulated in the Bill that there should be regional planning?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I come to that in my own time? Some of these questions, if I may say so with respect, might more helpfully be addressed to the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Dickson Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Do not be modest!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I may be allowed to develop my argument in my own way I shall be very grateful.<br><br>
One has to remember that, implicit in the regional concept, implicit in the idea of regional and infrastructural planning, there is the crucial question of economic planning and the availability of resources, and the 1947 legislation allowed a hiatus to remain in the statutory provisions of that Act. These are aspects of the planning problem which are given statutory recognition in the opening Clauses of the Bill.<br><br>
Clauses 1 and 2 contain requirements to consult. Clause 1(3)(a), for example, requires that there be taken into account the effect of developments in neighbouring districts. Clause 1(3)(c) requires to be taken into account the communications, transport system and traffic. Clause 2(4)(a) requires to be taken into account
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"current policies with respect to the economic planning and development of the region as a whole; and</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(<i>b</i>) to the resources likely to be available for the carrying out of the proposals of the structure plan"</p></blockquote>
Accordingly this legislation directs attention to, and imposes statutory requirements to take account of, those broad provisions and those broad principles, and, as the Minister pointed out in his opening speech, recognition has been given to the complexity and significance of the kind of planning decisions which will have to be taken under this legislation by taking power to set up planning inquiry commissions to deal with the more complex and more significant cases.<br><br>
I entirely agree with what the Minister has said about the desirability of the provisions with regard to publicity and the need, which is apparent even at the moment in certain regions, for the local planning authority to take the public with it. This fact accounts for a great deal of the trouble and difficulty in the operation of a planning system.<br><br>
My only comment on this is a Committee point and naturally at this stage I do not intend to take up time on it. Since the structure plan is essentially a written document and likely to be a lengthy written document it should be made available at reasonable cost to interested parties. The Minister of State might care to consider this proposition between now and Committee. It is not adequate for a complicated written document merely to be examined at selected places, to satisfy the requirements of co-operation fostered in the Bill.<br><br>
The distinction which is drawn between the structure plan on the one hand and the local plan on the other is an entirely logical one. Acceptable as these propositions and principles are, there are certain basic flaws in the machinery by which it is sought to effect the application of those principles. Just as it is logical to distinguish between a local plan on the one hand and a structure plan which has to have regard to the statutory criteria laid down on the other, it is equally quite illogical that one and the same authority should be responsible for both.<br><br>
11.0 a.m.<br><br>
There is an inconsistency, which is apparent from the very language used, because by definition a local planning
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0079">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
authority is an inappropriate body to initiate a structure plan, with its far-reaching regional and economic implications. In Scotland, there are about 57 or 58 local planning authorities. They include the counties of cities, of which Glasgow is perhaps the best example, the county councils, large burghs and also two small burghsâ€”St. Andrews and Thurso. On the one hand, we have something which nearly approaches a regional authority. At the other end of the scale, we have very small planning authorities. Without being disrespectful to any of them, I doubt whether anything more than a small minority of those local planning authorities have the staff resources or expertise to operate the concept of the structure plan as it should be operated. Even in the case of major authorities, such as Glasgow and Edinburgh, sometimes it is necessary for them to employ consultants to deal with some parts of their development plans. There is that difficulty of operating a structure plan through the agency of most existing local planning authorities.<br><br>
That apart, the regional concept is inconsistent with that unit of administration, and the proper authority to fulfil that function clearly is the new regional authorities which presumably will emerge from the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Local Government. I appreciate the force of what the Minister says about the difficulty of giving statutory recognition to that fact in advance of those recommendations or, perhaps more significantly, in advance of any statutory enactment following on those recommendations.<br><br>
Having diagnosed the nature of the problem correctly and analysed the functions necessary to deal with it, the inability to strike the correct level of responsibility for the performance of those functions is a very serious shortcoming of this legislation. It will be difficult if not impossible to operate it properly. If that cannot be put right in this Bill, it is very likely that it will be necessary for further legislative provisions to be made. The problem is not solved by the phasing provisions. We are dealing with functions and the need to set up a new regional authority to exercise the functions implied in the structure plan.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
From the planner's point of view, it is readily understood that it is desirable to think as far ahead as possible and in the most general terms. However, it must be remembered that the further ahead one looks and the more general the terms in which it is done, the more opposition is likely to be generated to the planning proposals on the part of those who are being planned. By creating a divide between the structure level of planning and the local level of planning, one of the problems is that, on one and the same issue, one will have two inquiries. The wider the proposals, the more likely it is that they will generate opposition, and nowhere is that more true than in the so-called action areas. One has only to look at Fig. 1 in the Planning Advisory Group's Report and the kind of proposal envisaged as the structure plan to realise the amount of opposition likely to flow from it. The definitions with regard to action areas are very loose and in marked contrast to the comprehensive development area procedure with which we have been familiar. It is a question of definition. If there is no definition, opposition will be generated.<br><br>
Presumably it was with that consideration in mind that the old procedure under the development plan regulations provided that, whereas a development plan had to be on a scale of 6 in. to the mile, a comprehensive development plan and a designation plan had to be on a scale of 25 in. to the mile. These proposals were dealing directly with the property rights of individuals, and it was anticipated that definition was necessary in their interests.<br><br>
The Minister of State has said that everyone was agreed that the designation procedure would have to go. One of the provisions of that procedure was a thoroughly good one. I refer to the provisions of Section 3(4)(a) of the 1947 Act, which provided that the Secretary of State would not approve a development plan which designated any land as subject to compulsory acquisition if it appeared to him that
<br><blockquote><p>"the acquisition was not likely to take place within ten years from the date on which the plan was approved".</p></blockquote>
If we depart from that, clearly we shall plan further ahead. If we do that in comprehensive development area or
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0080">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
"action area" procedures as is now envisaged, we shall build up a great deal of trouble.<br><br>
It involves all the difficulties of planning blight. That is a problem with which many hon. Members must be familiar. It arose sharply in the proposals of the Edinburgh Quinquennial Review, when a structure plan procedure was introduced in advance of the legislation. It was subsequently rejected by the Reporter, but it was there long enough to create difficulty. The effect can also be seen in areas of Glasgow subject to outline C.D.A. procedure which are falling into disrepair because owners are not willing to spend money on their properties. These are basic criticisms of the structure plan procedure, although the proposals are sound in principle.<br><br>
Another basic criticism of the Bill has been referred to by the Minister of State. It is the proposal of the Secretary of State to abdicate his responsibilities in connection with local plans and planning appeals. I do not criticise the Bill as following the English legislation, because town and country planning ought to be the same in both countries. However, it does not follow that the machinery by which it is put into effect is the same and, until now, it has not been the same.<br><br>
The provisions embodied in the English legislation in this context are followed slavishly in the Scottish Bill. The problem in England is well known and is set out in paragraph 1:29 of the Report, which says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The average time taken by the Ministry of Housing to deal with a development plan submission is two to three years, but some cases may take considerably longerâ€”some 60 town map submissions have been with the Ministry for more than three years."</p></blockquote>
To relieve that pressure in England, it was necessary to hive off local planning from the Ministry of Housing altogether.<br><br>
Another difficulty in England was that everything in England and Wales had to be channelled through London and presumably had to go through more than one Ministry; for example, road proposals would be considered by the Ministry of Transport. That was the problem in England. The solution worked out in the English Act is repeated in the provisions of Clause 9(1)
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
and 20(1) of the Scottish Bill. In my submission, these proposals are neither necessary nor desirable.<br><br>
The position in Scotland is different, for three reasons. One reason is that the volume of appeals is proprotionately lower. The real differences arise, however, from these facts. In Scotland, we have the Scottish Development Department bringing all planning considerations under one roof. Then again, as a unit of administration, Scotland is more suitable for this type of procedure than the larger and more densely populated areas of England and Wales.<br><br>
Having had some experience in planning, I want to compliment the Scottish Development Department for the valuable work that it has done since it was set up. We are fortunate in having a body of that nature. I know that the Scottish Development Department is strongly represented here, but that is not the reason why I say that. I intended to say it, anyway.<br><br>
There is no corresponding delay in Scotland and, to illustrate that fact, perhaps I might quote three major inquiries in the last two years. In the case of the Darnick development, near Galashiels, proposals were submitted in February, 1967, an inquiry was held by Sir Robert Russell in June, 1967, the report was submitted on 13th November, 1967, and the decision of the Secretary of State was taken on 24th November, 1967. If that is not speed and efficiency, I do not know what is. Certainly it cannot be argued that we have to change the machinery in Scotland for reason of delay. In the case of the Invergordon smelter development, the proposals were finalised in November, 1967, an inquiry was held by Mr. William Munro, Q.C., in March, 1968, and the Secretary of State gave his decision in May or June, 1968.<br><br>
Finally, the Edinburgh Quinquennial Review was complicated because the planning authority anticipated the provisions of this legislation. It may be an indication of the kind of problems which will arise with this legislation. The proposals were submitted in July, 1966. The inquiry under Mr. W. A. Elliot, Q.C., started on 30th January, 1967, and was completed, with intervals, in May, 1968. Because of the complexity of the inquiry, the report was in two parts. The ring
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0081">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
road proposal report was submitted in September, 1967, and the Secretary of State gave his decision in January, 1968. The remainder of the inquiry was reported on in November, 1967, and the decision was given in May, 1968. No one can say that there is an unwarrantable delayâ€”â€”</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Under this Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Under any Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These are all our work.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are told that we have to change the machinery because it is not working and because of delay. I am giving the most recent examples of the way the system is working. I do not care which Government operates it. This is not a party matter. We should not be silly about this. I submit that the system is working so well that there is no justication for changing it or for introducing the reasons adduced for the necessary change in England.<br><br>
11.15 a.m.<br><br>
Concerning appeals, the Secretary of State answered a Question put down by my hon. Friend the Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Gordon Campbell). It is difficult to say exactly how long appeals normally take, but it is clear from the Reply that they do not take very long. One reason why appeals sometimes take longer than they ought is because there is no statutory provision requiring a planning authority to submit its observations on the grounds of the appeal within a specified time. I am thinking of an inquiry on the corner of Princes Street and Hanover Street. The application was refused in July, 1967. It was only possible to fix the inquiry in March or April, 1968, I understand, because of delay on the part of the planning authority in getting its observations in. Having got the inquiry under way, Mr. Ian Macdonald, Q.C., made his report in May 1968, and the Secretary of State gave his decision in July, 1968.<br><br>
Local plans are very important, because they impinge directly on visual amenity, the lives of the people living in the urban areas particularly, and on the communities and individuals who live there. Is it desirable that there should be these changes?<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
I submit that it is not desirable in principle that a party to an inquiry should also decide the outcome of it. This is not only contrary to natural justice, but it also strikes at the relationship which we want to foster between the local authority and the community at large. Justice, as has been said on more than one occasion, has not only to be done; it has to be seen to be done. It is difficult for a local planning authority, with its considered proposals, to go into an inquiry, for the convener of the planning committee to be the leading policy witness, as is invariably the case, for the planning officer to be the main witness in the case, and at the end to say, "Yes. We were wrong and we will alter it." It could happen, but it is not very likely. In any event, I submit that these decisions should be taken by a third party: either by the Secretary of Stateâ€”and I should like to see that system carried onâ€”or, perhaps more appropriately, in a new Government or local government structure, by the top-tier local authority.<br><br>
There are two further reasons why a local authority should not have the last word in the face of opposition on any matter. First, these local plans by statute must conform to the structure plan. Its implication with the structure plan is an additional reason why a third party should view the matter from outside, as it were, and reach a decision.<br><br>
Secondly, we must remember that there are built-in provisions under Clause 14, which repeats, in terms, the provisions of Section 9(2) of the 1947 Act for an appeal to the Court of Session to challenge the validity of the plan. That is not a new provision, but the context in which it could be used, namely, whether the local plan conforms to the structure plan, is a new issue, which will lead to difficulty. Therefore, we should look carefully at whether the Court of Session is the appropriate body to consider a matter of this nature. As it stands, it is a new issue which is an additional reason why these provisions should be altered.<br><br>
The Minister has said that delegation to the inspectorate is not contemplated, because it involves the introduction into Scotland of a new feature, namely, a full-time inspectorate. If it is not contemplated, let us get it out of the Bill altogether. It is not necessary. The present
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0082">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
system of part-time reporters has worked adequately and has given the impression of impartiality which the public, by and large, has been prepared to accept. It would be difficult to get full-time reporters to do the job and it would be an expensive operation. It is cheaper as well as more satisfactory to continue to employ members of the Bar and retired civil servants for this job than to set up a full-time inspectorate. In any event, these decisions cannot be taken in isolation.<br><br>
These are my main criticisms. We will want to inquire into numerous other matters. For example, the absence of the designation procedure and the delegation to individual officers of a council to take decisions on planning matters. Is that wise? Is that not exposing an individual official of a local authority to most undesirable pressures? The position of statutory undertakers and open-ended provisions with regard to enforcement notices and so forth are matters which we will also consider in some depth.<br><br>
I should not like it to be thought that the speed with which this legislation passed through another place is to be taken as any indication of the treatment which it must necessarily get in Standing Committee when we consider it. I can understand the difficulty in another place with inadequate time to consider the matter. We hope to put the position right during Committee on the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Baxter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had hoped to hear a few more speeches before I participated. I saw few Members rising on this side of the Committee so I thought it would be better to make my contribution now.<br><br>
I have listened with great interest to the two speeches which have been delivered this morning. I am very disappointed in both of them.<br><br>
I will deal, first, with the speech of my hon. Friend the Minister of State. He has not given us very valid reasons why it is necessary to bring in the Bill at this time. He has not shown any justification for departing from the well-tried methods which have been adopted by succeeding Governments and local authorities on planning up to the present time. Nor has my hon. Friend shown any indication of his thinking on how the Bill will
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
fit into the new concept of local government which we expect to become an accomplished fact at some time in the not too distant future. I am more than disappointed with the way in which my hon. Friend tried to prove to the Committee the justification for introducing such legislation as the Bill.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) commenced his speech with considerable praise for the Measure. He seemed to indicate that he would give it his wholehearted support for particular reasons. Some of those reasons, however, seemed to become during his speech reasons for not supporting it, but for leaving matters as they are. The hon. and learned Gentleman said that the basis of planning, as envisage and practised under the 1947 Act, will not be fundamentally changed, but he went on to speak of the local authority participating in an application and becoming the judge of the matter under discussion. I found myself in some difficulty in understanding whether the hon. and learned Member was actually supporting the Measure or was diametrically opposed to it. However, in Committee we may find that he has good grounds for saying that there is much in the Measure that he can wholeheartedly support.<br><br>
I look upon the Measure as one which, if necessary at all, could have been held over till the new structure of local government had been established. I am mindful that the planning of our country is not something to come new before Parliament. I am also mindful that in the latter days of the war and the early days of peace Stirling County Council was asked by the Department to carry out a survey and produce a plan of its area based upon something like the concept contained in the Bill, with a localised development plan and a county development plan. We were asked to give the private achitects and private firms, who had little work at this time, the opportunity of planning our towns and villages as small units of population. A great deal of money and experience was expended on this project.<br><br>
The legislation of 1947 then came into being and we had another concept of what should be done. It was not to be done upon even county or town council basis; it was to be on the larger region.

Two very eminent planners were appointed to carry out the plans of those two regions, one by the name of Abercrombie and the other Sir Frank Mears. Those two gentlemen, along with committees with representatives of the various local authorities in the area, considered the whole of the Clyde Basin, taking in a lot of Stirlingshire as well. Considerable thought and planning went into the concept of a properly planned Clyde area. But what has happened to those plans that so much thought, time and money were lavished upon? Those plans have been short-circuited, this way, that way and the other way. All that time, money and effort have almost been wasted as a plan for that part of Scotland. Sir Frank Mears did one exceptionally good job, namely, the very fine development around the Castle at Stirling. That is indeed a worthwhile plan. It has only been spoilt by Stirling Town Council not finishing the Town Council buildings in accordance with the architectural concept of the original building. This shows lack of power and sensibility not of the local authority, but of the Secretary of State's Department. Before there could be a departure from Sir Frank Mears' plan for Stirling and for this additional modernised building to be put against the beautiful old baronial type building which was built originally, the Department had to agree to the prostitution of great and good class architecture. This showed lack of foresight in the central Government Department and bad planning.<br><br>
I would again refer to the Abercrombie Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure what my hon. Friend means by the word "prostitution".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Baxter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is prostitution of architecture: taking advantage of a position that should never have been taken advantage of. My right hon. Friend can look up this word in the dictionary. He will get its full meaning.<br><br>
11.30 a.m.<br><br>
The plan conceived by the Abercrombie Committee brought in the whole of the Lomondside and around that area. We have seen this area, too, being almost wasted by foolhardy planning and bad housing development. This
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
was due principally to the small-mindedness of local government representatives, in conjunction with lack of understanding by the central Department. An area in Stirlingshire was earmarked as an open space so that the beautiful view into the valley at Loch Lomond would not be impaired. An individual who applied to build houses on the site was rightly turned down by the local planning committee, basing its concept on the Abercrombie Plan. But, as time passes, constant dripping wears away the stone, and the plan has been worn away. Houses were ultimately permitted on this beautiful site, blocking the vista which Abercrombie had sought to preserve.<br><br>
There is here a danger in giving more power to local authorities and not sufficient to the central authority. By continually using influences here and there one can undermine a local authority's original sound decision. That is the danger I see in greater powers for local authorities without a central body controlling them. The smaller the local authority, the more difficult it is to stop influences being brought to bear on its members. As has been rightly said, there are 58 planning authorities in Scotland and the Bill gives them a greater degree of power than they now possess.<br><br>
This is a bad Measure in its present form. One would have hoped that a young man in a new Government, with a belief in a new concept of civilisation, and with all the other great events going on around us, such as man's ventures to the moon, would have seized his opportunity to bring in, on behalf of the Government, a new Measure with far better concepts of planning than this. But the opportunity has been lost because, he says, the Government want to get this Bill in much the same form as the English Measure. We are still living in the past, with the old concepts and ways of planning. My hon. Friend had here the opportunity to put the stamp of progress on planning and he has lost it.<br><br>
In Clause 2 my hon. Friend asks for "structure plans" and local plans. This is the great age of new words. How stupid can we become? Since 1947 we have recognised the term "development plans". Now they become "structure plans". That is the debased coinage used in this Measure, on the basis that one
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0084">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 27</span>
need only alter a word or two to make a thing seem more meaningful and important to people who do not know better. Yet the new provisions for "structure plans" are little different, if at all, from the present system, which itself is not as good as it should be.<br><br>
There is considerable room for planning improvement in the country, but anyone with experience of local government would not have introduced such a Measure. It is based on certain reports, but we all know that committee reports are only as strong as the strongest man on the committee and that his opinion is the committee's opinion. It does not necessarily follow that the report is sound or good because he is a strong man. It only means one man's opinion. Why disregard the opinions of Scottish Members of Parliament? Their opinion has never been asked or considered. A Bill is placed in our hands and we must either reject it or accept it with minor Amendments. That is our present Parliamentary system. That is the sum of our deliberations and is the wrongness of modern Parliamentary procedure.<br><br>
Let us take the case of the immunity period when a development has taken place. A farmer seeks to reclaim a piece of waste land by dumping some debris in a hole. But if he has not asked planning permission, he can be penalised for so doing. Up to now, if he has not been brought to court within two years, he will not be prosecuted. The matter will have been forgotten. Under this Bill, he can now be prosecuted up to four years after the offence. Yet when a man reclaims waste land he is doing so not only for himself but for the public at large and for future generations.<br><br>
A prosecution can be instituted if the local planning committee so desires. We are all very much bigoted people. We all have our hates. If the majority on the local committee are sufficiently prejudiced, the farmer can be prosecuted for what he has done for the common weal. The whole basis of putting such power into the hands of little people without a proper court of appeal is fundamentally wrong. It is tantamount to breaking down the whole system of the judiciary. The basis of our judicial system is the right of appeal, and if any-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
thing appears to undermine that, it should be looked at with great concern by all of us.<br><br>
I have read the Report of the House of Lords proceedings, which did not amount to much, and I have done my best to understand what my hon. Friend is trying to do by this Bill. There are, of course, some good aspects to the Billâ€”but there is always a good bit in a rotten apple. That does not mean, however, that we should eat the whole damn thing.<br><br>
Let us also take the case of the local authority which has acquired land in its own right and has become a considerable landowner. That land may be ripe for development, but it does not seek to develop it. If the land were owned by a private individual all sorts of pressures would be brought to bear on him for development. Even the Land Court could seek to get it developed. But are not local authorities above the law in this respect? Cannot they hold on to the land just because they are local authorities? This Bill does not give us any clue to that.<br><br>
Another problem is whether the local authority can with immunity ride roughshod over the Bill when it comes to building a school or clinic, or establishing an open space. My hon. Friend should carefully consider whether local authorities have not been doing this for far too long and whether they should continue to be above the law in this respect.<br><br>
There is much to be commended in the Bill but a great deal to deprecate. I counsel my hon. Friend that during the remainder of his term of office as Minister of State, he should bring forward Measures appropriate to the time in which we live, and not be hidebound by concepts of planning or anything else in England.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In introducing the Bill the Minister of State partially answered some of the more obvious criticisms. I found a great deal to agree with in the hon. Gentleman's speech, and also in the excellent speech of the hon. Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. W. Baxter). I agree with most of what the hon. Member for West Stirlingshire said, and congratulate him on some of his <i>bons mots.</i><br><br>
I wonder why the Government have chosen this moment to bring forward
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0085">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 29</span>
the Bill. It is inappropriate to do so when we are awaiting the report of the Royal Commission on Local Government. It is surely obvious that we should await publication of such a report before a Bill like this is produced.<br><br>
11.45 a.m.<br><br>
Then there are the proposals for "structural plans". What was wrong with the word "regional", which is so well understood by the people of Scotland? "Structure" means nothing to them unless it is explained. "Regional" seems to be the word we have come to use in this context. Perhaps it did not mean what I thought. Perhaps the Minister can clarify that. Why should this be based on the English pattern when the situation is so very different in Scotland? I do not say this from any narrow, nationalist sentiments. In England, with a central system of government, with county councils, this proposal might be entirely appropriate. In Scotland, however, where we have the Scottish Development Department, which has been pretty successful, why should we have such a system, which suits an English structure?<br><br>
The appeals procedure in England is very slow. Very rarely are appeals dealt with in less than two years. The system is notoriously slow, and often takes longer than two years. In Scotland the procedure has been much more rapid on the whole. Why are we to go over to the English procedure? I am very doubtful about the proposed inquiry procedure being entirely devolved from the Secretary of State or, in practice, from the Scottish Development Department, to local authorities, through the medium of full-time reporters. The same broadly applies to the proposals for dealing with appeals against a planning authority. This may involve a whole series of delays at different levels.<br><br>
Since the Government have chosen to introduce this Bill at this seemingly inappropriate moment, I want to deal with some of the sins of omission, which are more numerous than the sins of commission. Looking at Part I, it is our view that the new provisions, such as the development plans, should provide for complete surveys of all land, not piecemeal surveys. This should be carried out regionally, and the land zoned into five
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
categoriesâ€”land for urban development, for industrial development, for agriculture, for forestry, and for recreation.<br><br>
I will not return to the old nostrum referred to on previous occasions, but there should be provision for a system of rating designed to guide or steer land into recommended zones. May I ask the Minister to give his views on these development plans and say whether they are intended to be complete and to cover all the land in particular areas, or are just to be done in certain districts where a local authority considers that a plan is necessary?<br><br>
I turn now to Part II, dealing with enforcement of planning control, and particularly Clause 17 which is concerned with certificates for establishing the use of land. Does this Clause mean that if land has been put to any use before, say, 1964, regardless of whether it is a good or bad use, a certificate will more or less automatically be granted, and regardless of whether it is misuse or good use, that land will be allowed to remain in that category? Will this apply to agriculture and forestry? The Minister knows my feelings on this. There are many areas of Scotland entirely suitable for forestry but which are at present being operated on an extensive system of agriculture, and <i>vice versa.</i> This is important for Scotland as a whole, and I would like this point to be considered in the provision of development plans.<br><br>
Part III deals with the appeals procedure. What, if any, right or means will an appellant have for calling in the Secretary of State if he feels that the decision of a reporter is unsatisfactory? In other words, on what occasions, and in what circumstances, will the Secretary of State make use of the powers given to him under Clause 22?<br><br>
Part IV deals with acquisition and disposal of land. Does Clause 28 give the right to local authorities to acquire land for agricultural, forestry and recreational purposes? Why is this to be on a local rather than regional basis, which I would have thought would be more appropriate?<br><br>
Suppose a large agricultural estate comes on to the market and a local authority learns that an individual, may be a development company from the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0086">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 31</span>
South, or a large landowner, is intending to buy this estate complete and use it for practising agriculture on a very large scale, ranching perhaps. My own view is that there is an ideal size for every type of agriculture and every type of farm. I do not agree with the view, so often put forward, that the larger the farm the more efficient it is. In such a case I see an excellent opportunity for a local authority temporarily, to buy that land, to act as a land bank, and to re-let units of suitable economic size on that estate to approved tenants on an interest and repayment basis. This would be an excellent system, and I would like the Minister's views on it. It is not new. It is something that I have thought about for a long time, and the more I see the way land is going in Scotland the more appropriate I believe it to be.<br><br>
Does Clause 28 give local authorities the power to acquire land for forestry, amenity or for shelter? Will they have powers to acquire land for parks, nature reserves and so on? How does this dovetail in with the Land Commission? The two must overlap and I would like to hear the Minister's views.<br><br>
I have no major criticisms of Part V, about buildings of architectural and historic interest.<br><br>
On the final Parts of the Bill, the miscellaneous and general, I have one or two brief queries. I am a little worried about Clause 63, the general authorisation. I would like to know what safeguards there are against this more or less <i>carte blanche</i> being given to individual employees of local authorities.<br><br>
I want to give the Minister notice of a small Amendment which I hope to table and which would affect Clauses 89 to 91. This is in case he wishes to make any advance inquiries. I hope to table an Amendment obliging local authorities to produce maps and schedules of rights of way in their areas.<br><br>
May I take this opportunity of apologising to the Minister of State for that, due to circumstances beyond my control, I shall not be able to be here on Thursday. I hope to be a regular attender at all meetings of the subsequent Committee, but regret that I cannot be here on Thursday, when, perhaps, he
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
will be replying to some of the questions which I have put.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Lawson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is already becoming clear from the speeches which we have so far heard that the Bill will not have as smooth a passage as one might have thought after listening to the two opening speeches. These were of considerable interest and, if I may say so in the absence of the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie), I thought that he had much to say which ought to be considered very closely. He said that the Bill was an important one which could have great significance for Scotland for the rest of the century. I would be happy to see the Bill treated in this way, and for there to be co-operation between both sides in order to produce a worthwhile Bill for Scotland, with a minimum of partisan feeling.<br><br>
I am puzzled by the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. W. Baxter). He began in that impassioned and effective way of his, and I thought that he was arguing for a Measure which would give to the central authority very considerable control over what happens in the regions or small localities. I thought that he was denouncing the Bill for not taking this opportunity to obtain for Scotland much more effective central control. When he talked of the plans for the whole of the Clyde Basin, and what had happened to those plans subsequently, due, I gather, to the fact that there was no effective power to interfere with local vested interests, I thought that he was attacking those local vested interests which prevented the sensible development of a substantial areaâ€”as sensible as was possible.<br><br>
Having listened to this, and having thought that my hon. Friend was making a strong plea along those lines, which I favour in many respects, I was surprised when he turned in the direction that he did and seemed to be arguing for almost unlimited power for individuals, to do as they might think fit, irrespective of what the longer term, or even the immediate, interest of the locality might be.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Baxter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend must have misunderstood me. I was illustrating a point. It is a small but important one, but it has considerable effect
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0087">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 33</span>
upon certain sections of the community. I was dealing with the two-year period being increased to four years. I was ilustrating the point and not suggesting that people should be permitted to ride roughshod over the law. I deprecated the fact that local authorities have been riding roughshod over the law. I want that stopped.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lawson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend seemed to be in conflict with what I thought was his argument.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. James Davidson) said much that I thought was sensible. I thought that he and his party were the arch-supporters of devolution in this set-up of ours. I thought that they wanted to move away from too much control at the centre, to more delegation to local authorities. "Participation" is the great word.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. J. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is quite right in the broad sense, but if he looks at Liberal Party policy he will see that we have always advocated that town and country planning should be on a regional basis.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lawson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Even "regional" means a considerable movement towards a locality.<br><br>
I presume that if this is to mean anything there has to be maximum participation by individuals and groups. This is what I mean by this devolution, this individual involvement. The Bill is providing a fairly substantial measure of such devolution. I am not saying to the Secretary of State that I am agreeing with this entirely, but anyone who stands for more devolution, more local participation, could hardly object to this type of provision. I am puzzled by strenuous speeches which, while they are made in one direction, contradict it when it leads to an application which is even in line with it.<br><br>
12 noon.<br><br>
I thank my hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire for opening up a subject which is very close to my heart. He gave an illustration of a farmer who dumps waste material in a hole in the ground and who is reclaiming the ground. No doubt, in many instances what an individual is doing on a given piece of land is ultimately beneficial to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 34</span>
that piece of land or to the neighbourhood, but it may be that what is being dumped is not beneficial either to the ground or to the neighbourhood. A noxious liquid dumped into a hole may seep through the ground to an adjacent river. Insecticides used for useful purposes may seep into a river, destroying the life in the riverâ€”or the life in the air. These are illustrations of how what may properly be done for an immediate personal or sectional interest can have considerable implications for others. As I understand the position, anyone may dump liquids or materials into the ground, and such materials may seep into rivers; there is no control over this. The river purification boards can do nothing about it; very often they cannot trace where the noxious influence comes from, and they have no power to deal with it.<br><br>
Does the Bill provide such a power? If it does not, is it the intention of my hon. Friend to provide such a power? I am in favour of giving as much individual freedom as possible, but we live in a civilised society, in groups, and we must accommodate ourselves to one another. My hon. Friend the Member for Maryhill (Mr. Hannan) tells an excellent story about accommodation between husband and wife. The husband and wife were always arguing about where they should go, and on one night the husband wanted to go to the pictures and his wife wanted to see her mother. They argued about it and eventually compromisedâ€”and went to see the wife's mother. This is a "compromise" which I do not like. Some means must be found whereby the common interest is made paramount and we are trying to achieve the paramountcy of the common interest.<br><br>
I think my hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire, who is so sound at heart, will agree with me on this. Although the farmer who was dumping waste material into the ground might on this occasion have been doing a useful job, on another occasion it might be harmful, and this harmful action should be brought under control.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Baxter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I mentioned, merely by way of illustration, a farmer filling a hole on his land. I only hope my hon. Friend's example, in taking it so much to heart, will not be followed by hon.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0088">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 35</span>
Members debating the illustration he gave of the husband and wife, and debating that rather than the contents of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lawson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I saw that you were about to call me to order, Sir Beresford, and I am sure you will allow nobody to debate the story I told. It was so illustrative of the position that it would have been a pity not to have retold that story told by my hon. Friend the Member for Maryhill.<br><br>
There are other practices apart from that of dumping noxious liquids and other materials into the ground. I have been concerned about the serious destruction of a substantial part of the River Clyde. A process of tearing up the bed in certain parts of the river is now going on which is turning sections of what was one of the finest angling rivers in the country into little more than canals because of the ease with which the sand and gravel can be extracted. There are no powers properly to control this practice.<br><br>
Surely, it is a part of the purpose of structure plans, regional plans or local plans, to control our environment. We cannot divorce a man from his environment; a man's environment makes him. If we make it an ugly environment we cannot expect to have people with the kind of characteristics which the hon. Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith) would like them to have. Such characteristics cannot emerge from the despoiled environments in which people live. The primary purpose of the Bill is to make the area in which we live an area in which it is worth while to live.<br><br>
Although there is specific mention of roads and buildings, there is no mention of what might happen to a river, and a river can make a place. I am looking for an answer. If there is no answer written into the Bill I hope that my hon. Friend or this Committee will bring forward an answer. We must have sand and gravel, but we must see that sand and gravel are extracted from the earth in ways that do least damage to the environment.<br><br>
Because of the lack of power adequately to control vested interests, it is possible for someone to make a lot of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 36</span>
money by doing this sort of thing without regard to what happens to other people or what may for generations be the effects upon an area that was once attractive. The important thing according to some people is that someone has made money out of it. Whichever side of the Committee we sit on, we do not think this. We are concerned with the worthwhileness of our part of the world. Scotland is a small part of the world, and it is up to us by means of such Measures as are put forward here to do something about it.<br><br>
Sometimes a local authority is too close; it may be too easily get-at-able by vested interests, or not strong enough to resist them. I have in mind the building of houses on the Pentland Hills. For years as a native of Edinburgh I walked up Bonaly Hill and on to the hills, to Juniper Green and Currie. I knew almost every foot of this area. It is criminal to build houses up the side of the hill, thus destroying the facilities which should be enjoyed by the people in the area.<br><br>
If giving more power to the local authority means that the immediate vested interest will take the first consideration, or that there is insufficient power to stand out against that type of pressure, then I would say we should scrap the additional powers of the local authority and think in terms of a greater central authority. I am not a devolutionist in the normal sense. I hope to give the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands all the support I can if he is taking this line. It often happens that, where there is a conflict about a vested interest, it is impossible to settle the conflict at local level. It is the same with the trade unions and in many other spheres. A conflict is more likely to be settled by pulling it away from the local level so that it can be considered in a more reasonable way.<br><br>
The structure plan looks at a larger area. I do not know if it is a regional area, but a "regional" area has come to have certain connotations. It has a certain label. Sometimes it is useful to change a label in order to prompt a different way of thinking about it. I think the idea here is that a fairly large area can be looked at as a whole, overriding sectional and local government boundaries, and that there should be an overall
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0089">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 37</span>
conception as to how best the area could function, and what are the outstanding features which should be preserved. The Bill is positive, as distinct from the negative "preservation of". If the idea is to look at a large area and produce a structure plan with ideas on what beneficial changes should be made as well as what ought to be preserved, with local interests fitted into this in a way that matches the larger interest, then I am all for it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is not the whole difficulty here that the structure plan is not a regional plan and ought to be a regional plan?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lawson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure. I do not know if a regional plan would mean the whole of the Clyde Valley and the whole of the West of Scotland. It may be that a substantially smaller area would Come within the term "structure" plan. II am in favour of elasticity, and it may be that we should have several structure plans fitting together and making up a regional plan. I do not want to tie myself down to a word which has well established connotations. In the sense that the term structure plan does not have those connotations, it is useful. If what is intended here is not being legislated for, and if the object sought is not properly reached by the Bill, I hope that my hon. Friend will look closely into suggestions for giving the powers that we want.<br><br>
We want larger areas in our country to be looked at comprehensively, and, where decisions can be taken, we want positive decisions as well as negative decisions, decisions for development as well as for preservation. We also wish to include in planning everything in the environmentâ€”rivers, and holes in the ground, as well as buildings and roads. We want to include all these things, and then fit in the smaller areas.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Baxter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely, under the 1947 Act all these powers are vested in the local authorities, including the winning and working of minerals. Power is vested in the local authority, in relation to a river bed or anywhere else, to stipulate, before planning permission is granted, that the persons who are developing shall put at the disposal of the local authority a certain amount of the money which will
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 38</span>
be made from that development, so as to ensure that the land is reclaimed in a proper fashion after the development is completed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lawson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend knows more about this from his practical experience than I do, and I accept what he says. If what he says is accurate, we shall be wasting our time on a Bill of this sort. I understand that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands, has had considerable experience of these matters, and I did not gather from him, although he had certain reservations and criticisms, that he regarded the Bill as being nothing more than what was already on the Statute Book. He said that this could be the most important piece of legislation that this Committee had dealt with over a number of years.<br><br>
12.15 p.m.<br><br>
On that basis, I take my stand. Clearly, there are practices in our countryside which should be brought under control. If this Bill is a means whereby that can be done, in order that larger benefits can be achieved, I support it. I hope that my hon. Friend will be ready to listen to any criticisms which may be made and, if they are fair and just, try to meet them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Clark Hutchison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make four very short points. The first is that, as everyone in the Committee knows, there is a Royal Commission sitting at the moment considering local government in Scotland. It is expected to advocate a marked reduction in the number of local authorities. That will affect the powers of local authorities, their boundaries, and planning in all its aspects. Surely it is unwise to proceed with this Bill till we know what the Royal Commission proposes; otherwise, in a very few years, it will need considerable amendment and alteration. In my view, we are legislating too much. We would be well advised to rely on the present planning Acts till we know where we are about the structure of local government which is to come.<br><br>
Secondly, I am far from satisfied with Clauses 3 and 7, which deal with the publicity given to plans. Planning and developments often take place, and people nearby who are affected do not realise it. It may be their own fault, but in practice they do not realise. There
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0090">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 39</span>
seems to be a complete lack of communication whereby information is made known locally. I have raised this point many times, and I thought that the Minister of State would rectify the position. I am disappointed to see that he has not done so. It is no good laying down in Clauses 3 and 7 that local planning authorities should take such steps as in their opinion will secure adequate publicity. That is not good enough. Something much more detailed and widespread is required. The Minister of State generally is fairly reasonable on these matters. I ask him to look at this again. I have not the answer, but I suggest that if a local authority or developer is proposing developments, everyone within a reasonable radius of, say, a quarter or half mile must be notified individually. It need not be a long communication, but everyone should be notified and told where more detailed information can be seen. I do not mind how it is done so long as it is done. At the moment, people do not get a fair deal.<br><br>
Thirdly, I refer to a situation which arises frequently when planning decisions have been made. In my constituency, the Corporation wished to build on an open space. People living nearby objected. The proposal was examined, and the reporter upheld the objectors. His report went to the Secretary of State, and he upheld the reporter and the objectors. However, within eighteen months, the Corporation is beginning again to attack the area. This is the negation of justice. It costs people money to defend their homes and open spaces. If a decision is made, it should stand for 10 or 20 years. This point is not covered in the Bill. I hope that the Minister will see that it is, and that justice is secured. We cannot have decisions made by responsible people only to see the question raised again. It is contrary to any legal procedure.<br><br>
Fourthly, I am not satisfied about the appeal machinery which is set out in Clause 21 and following provisions. The present arrangement of having an investigation by a reporter, an advocate, or other responsible person, is a very good one. The proposal is gone into thoroughly, and then the Secretary of State has to look at it. I have heard no complaints about
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 40</span>
the system, and the number of appeals is quite manageable. I think that the Minister of State said that there were about 200 a year. I thought that it was nearer 300. But why change to the English system and have an inspectorate? It will be far more expensive, and I am not sure that it will be so well trusted by the people. I think that the Minister should delete this part of the Bill. If he does, I am sure that he will have the support of hon. Members on all sides. Any change will worsen the position and remove the Secretary of State from what is going on in Scotland. It will make him more remote instead of being more identified with the problems of the country. I hope that the Minister will look at this again with a view to deleting these Clauses.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John P. Mackintosh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to follow the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) with one or two equally brief points on the general principle of the Bill.<br><br>
Once again, I ask my hon. Friend why he comes forward with such a Bill at this juncture. Does he consider that the work which it will impose on people is worth while in the interim period between the Bill being passed and any changes in the pattern of local government? The Bill suggests that 57 authorities should be asked to produce structure plans for their areas. But how many of these authorities have the necessary staff to produce the kind of structure plans which my hon. Friend envisages? I do not point the finger at any of them, but the production of such a plan is a highly technical and complicated operation. In Scotland there are only about a dozen authorities with fully equipped staffs capable of carrying out the present planning powers, much less the more elaborate and detailed planning procedures suggested in the Bill. If only a minority of authorities have the necessary capacity, what is the point of laying this responsibility on all 57 at this time?<br><br>
Let us trace what is likely to happen if the Bill is passed. The 57 planning authorities will be asked to produce structure plans. They will have to discover what are the economic plans for their areas, what the Countryside Commission intends, and what the various
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0091">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 41</span>
passenger transport authorities intend. They will have to go through the admirable procedure of publishing their proposals and providing a fixed period of time for people to make objections. Those objections will have to be considered, and then the authorities will have to write final structure reports and submit them to the Secretary of State. What time span does the Minister envisage these procedures covering? Will it not mean that the majority of plans will come through for approval at about the time when a normal Government would be expected to enact the proposals of the Royal Commission? Is it worth while putting authorities to this extra trouble when it is not clear what structure planning will be enacted at about the time when their plans reach the Minister's desk?<br><br>
On the question of more detailed local planning, authorities cannot proceed with their local plans till structure plans are approved. I know that it is provided in the Bill that they can go ahead with the Secretary of State's permission, but it would be an unwise local authority which produced a local action plan without having first produced a structure plan. It is unlikely that any structure plans, and even more unlikely that any local action plans, will see the light of day before the Royal Commission's report is acted upon or the Government of the day decide what to do about it. I am sure that the Minister of State does not suggest that the Royal Commission's report will be put aside. It will be acted upon, and, if it is, what is the point of enacting this legislation in the interim?<br><br>
The greatest weakness in our regional or local planning system is the divorce between use planning and economic planning. This Bill does nothing to bridge the problem. Fundamentally, it is a structural problem, and one of arrangement and machinery. The 57 authorities in no way coincide with the subsections into which Scotland is divided for the purposes of sub-regional or regional planning. I do not know how the communication will be achieved. At present, the Borders Group, the Tayside Group and the North-East Consultative Planning Group consider that they are not obliged to tell anyone what they are planning. They consider that they are not obliged to per-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 42</span>
mit hon. Members to attend their meetings, and we do so only by invitation. I was at one meeting where local authority representatives asked if they could tell their respective authorities what was proposed for the area. The official answer was, "No. You may be here because you are a provost or a councillor, but you are not here in a representative capacity, and you are not allowed to go back to your town council and tell it what is proposed for your area." How, then, does a local authority learn about what is planned for its area? At what stage are the proposals published?<br><br>
The great problem in the whole idea of land use and economic planning is that Scotland is so hopelessly divided between many authorities, each of which has its own area and <i>amour propre</i> and each of which has to be consulted. How can the system proposed be organised? Is it suggested that the S.D.D. will be the broker and advise a planning officer not to go for a certain road because the local planning group have gone for another road, or not to try to improve a by-pass because the railway is to be dropped by the passenger transport authority? Is that the sort of procedure which the Minister envisages?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I feel that this is a little unfair on the Groups. I will not acknowledge the criticisms made by my hon. Friend about invitations to hon. Members. That is a matter for the Groups to decide. Some of them invite hon. Members. However, the Groups try very hard to publicise what they have been discussing, and they hold frequent Press conferences. I agree that individual local authority members are not there binding their own authorities to what is decided, but they are not restricted in going back to their authorities and saying what is proposed by the Group concerned. Perhaps my hon. Friend's own area is the most advanced in this connection.</span></p>
<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mackintosh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to my hon. Friend. The idea behind it is that there is a regional planning Group covering the Borders and that the planning officers and planning committees of the various local authorities in the area will go to the regional planning Group and discuss the points suggested in the Bill, because it is laid down that structure
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0092">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 43</span>
plans shall take these matters into consideration. Clause 2(4) says that they must pay attention
<br><blockquote><p>"to current policies with respect to the economic planning and development of the region as a whole".</p></blockquote>
Does this mean that the half dozen planning committees and their officials will meet the regional economic planning Group and work out how the land use planning of their areas will fit in with the economic plans being devised? If so, it is a great step forward. If the Minister will confirm that, it will be a tremendous advance, because it will suggest that he is envisaging that structure plans should be regional plans and that they should fit the regional areas for economic planning. If they do not do this it is no step forward and no advance.<br><br>
I press the Minister to say why he will not, for <i>ad hoc</i> purposes, group the planning authorities into regions now as the Bill goes through and say that, for the interim period before local government is changed, certain specified planning authorities ought to meet the local economic planning council, the Countryside Commission and the local passenger transport authorities, when appointed, to try to do the structural job as it should be done, taking these major matters into consideration together. If the Minister were prepared to say that, it would be a great advance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend mean that we should propose an additional Schedule to the Bill with the groupings, or be content, as a Department, to recommend identifiable groups without statutory backing?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mackintosh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suggest at this juncture, considering the time factors involved and the fact that we would not wish to pre-empt the decision of the Wheatley Commission, that we see it not as a Schedule but as a recommendation, and that machinery be provided by which a Group could meet in consultation with local planning councils for the area so that they could fulfil the purposes of the Bill and the structure plan would be a regional plan. Without this, the Bill does not make sense. The structure plan cannot be done on a county by county basis.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree that if we are to try to make the structure plan a regional
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 44</span>
plan we need to set up in the Statute some form of regional authority, and for that (a Schedule would be necessary. Having done that, it would be simple to transfer those regionalised responsibilities to the new regions set up under the local government provisions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mackintosh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that this would be very good. The only reason why I thought that the Minister might cavil at this is that the precise groupings of the regions might suggest that the Government had made up their mind about the sizes and areas of regional bodies before they had taken time to study the Wheatley Commission Report and any representations which the public might wish to make. If they wish to avoid this, it can be done in the manner suggested by the Minister. However, the time scale is such, with the Wheatley Commission report coming out in a matter of months, that any suggestion about groupings of this kind could follow directly and those areas would be so busy getting it working that we would have time to act in a more positive and legal fashion in the case of any area which refused.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Baxter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A similar committee was set up when, by a general indication from the Department, local authorities sent their representatives for consultation in drawing up what became the Abercrombie Report. There is no reason why this should not be done.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mackintosh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to my hon. Friend. This is the kind of idea that I had in mind. This has happened not merely on the Abercrombie Report, but in other cases. For example, in the case of housing for the Bathgate motor factory a similar suggestion of <i>ad hoc</i> grouping took place to consider specific problems The Highlands Development Board similarly found that <i>ad hoc</i> meetings of the county councils to co-ordinate economic planning with land use planning were very useful.<br><br>
I am grateful to the Minister for his intervention and the suggestion that the Bill is not just as it stands on paper, but is a stepping stone towards the regionalisation grouping which is to come under the Wheatley Commission report or the legislation that takes its place. If this is the case it will straighten out a number
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0093">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 45</span>
of the other provisions, particularly concerning appeals.<br><br>
It seems to make good sense that if there is argument about the lower-tier planning of local action areas and there is an appeal, it should go, in effect, to the upper-tier planning unit. What has worried me about planning appeals is not the impartiality of people conducting them, but the fact that the basic problem is to combine private rights with alternative community interests. It is not a matter where pure legal considerations come in; it is a matter in which partly planning considerations come in. Therefore, we want a superior planning body which can consider the overall interests of the area and say, "In your particular locality it does not need to be done like this to achieve the total benefit of the area." It can suggest, for instance, that a particular road, housing development or amenity could go in at <i>x</i> place rather than <i>y</i> place to fit in with the overall regional plan. Given these various changes and emphases in this legislation, if it is a steppingstone towards the reform of local government, it is admirable, and the objectives of the Bill are to be welcomed. I am grateful to the Minister for clarifying these points in the course of my speech.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Secretary of State means well. He is, after all, a stout opponent of Scottish Nationalists. Yet the sad thing is that almost every step that the right hon. Gentleman takes provides the Scottish Nationalists with further ammunition. For example, what could be more ridiculous than to have a Second Reading this morning on a very complicated Bill followed by a Second Reading this afternoon on a very controversial Bill? No wonder, when we have two such Measures being debated on the same day, that we get such a bad Press in Scotland and people complain that they do not know what we are doing. Perhaps this is intentional. Perhaps the Minister is so ashamed of his Measures that he does not want publicity for them. Whatever the reason, it does not look good. I think that hon. Members should recognise it is not good to have two Bills of this magnitude on the same day.<br><br>
It does not look good either that the Bill we are debating should be so indistinguishable from the English Act when
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 46</span>
conditions in Scotland are not the same as in England. If the Secretary of State could not wait till the Wheatley Commission had reported, which I believe he should have done, because the arrangements of local authorities are so intimately concened in it, and if he was determined to duplicate the English Act, why not a joint United Kingdom Bill with the Scottish terms included in it, instead of having two teams of Members of Parliament, two teams of Ministers, and two teams of officials, tied up for weeks on end discussing the same thing? It will be a terrible waste of time if there are to be no deviations from the English pattern, which is what I suspect.<br><br>
In the hope that I may be wrong and in the hope that the Minister may have listened to what many of his hon. Friends have said and not be absolutely bound by what is convenient to the Ministry of Housing and Local Government, I will make one or two suggestions in an entirelyâ€”and I stress thisâ€”non-party spirit.<br><br>
First, the major innovation in the Bill, which is the concept of the structure plan. At first sight, it seems a good idea to let people know what is in the air. But why should this vague idea be anything but vague? Why seek to clothe it with statutory authority? The moment that it is clothed with statutory authority every person who thinks that he may be affectedâ€”and no one can be certain about it, because of the vaguenessâ€”will put in an appeal to the Secretary of State when it may turn out that he will not be affected. The danger which the Minister wishes to avoid of being bogged down with appeals is the kind of danger which the Bill may even create.<br><br>
Why does the Bill drop the comprehensive development area concept, which was fairly definite, in favour of the action area, which is inevitably much vaguer? I think that I am right in saying that the C.D.A. procedure does not exist in England. That is surely no reason for dropping the C.D.A. procedure in Scotland, where it has worked reasonably wellâ€”at least, in Glasgow. From what I can make out, there is a great deal more certainty and lack of confusion for individuals than is likely with these new action areas. When the Minister replies on Thursday I hope that he will tell us what the reaction of the local authoritiesâ€”Glasgow in particularâ€”has been to the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0094">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 47</span>
proposal to do away with the comprehensive development area.<br><br>
The second major change that I do not like is the one which gives a local authority the final say in the local plan. This has been referred to by many hon. Members. Surely it cannot be right. It infringes an elementary rule of natural justice, that no one should be the judge in his own cause.<br><br>
I recently raised a case with the Secretary of Stateâ€”I do not know whether the Minister is aware of itâ€”where one local authority, a town, was complaining about planning permission being granted by the county to a change of zoning just outside the burgh boundary. The decision went against the burgh. Because the decision was taken by the Secretary of State everyone will probably feel that it was relatively impartial, because the Secretary of State is used to working in a quasi-judicial capacity. It would be impossible to feel like this if the local authority which had been promoting the change of zoning had had the final say. I, therefore, feel strongly that the Secretary of State should retain the ultimate authority of appeal.<br><br>
Perhaps the Minister will agree if I point out one advantage. In addition to complying with the spirit of natural justice, there would be far fewer appeals at the structure plan stage, because individuals would know that when it came to the local plan the right to appeal to the Secretary of State would not have been lost. So long as people have the right to appeal on the local plan they would not have the same incentive to appeal, perhaps needlessly, at the structure plan stage.<br><br>
The third change that I do not like is in the appeal procedure. The first suggestion in the Bill is that the reporter should make the decision, not the Secretary of State. This seems all wrong, because many decisions involve economic and sociological issues. They are not really judgments in the legal sense; they are essentially political decisions. Because of this, I think that they should be taken by a Minister who is politically responsible to the House. I understand that the volume of appeals in England is so great that this simply is not possible. But in Scotland there are relatively few
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 48</span>
appeals. When I was at the Department, I never found any difficulty in dealing with appeals, and I am certain that the present Minister of State is equally attentive to his duties. Since in Scotland we are able to do the job, let us keep the Ministerial responsibility, even though in England they can no longer handle it.<br><br>
Secondly concerning appeals, the suggestion is made that powers should be taken to substitute an inspectorate for the present reporters. When I was at the Scottish Office I had this proposal made from time to time. I did not like it then and I do not like it any more now. It has been going around for a long time, and I do not think that we should have anything to do with it. The present reporters are adequate. They are fairly speedy and absolutely independent. I believe that to be a much better arrangement than to have a body of inspectors who, whatever their quality, will be full-time salaried officials. Lord Hughes, in another place, asked for details of the inspectors, said there was no immediate intention of appointing any. If that is so, why put that in the Bill? Legislation for possible eventualities should not be allowed, and we should have nothing to do with it.<br><br>
12.45 p.m.<br><br>
Although I am opposed to an inspectorate for dealing with appeals, I wonder whether the Department is sufficiently staffed to deal adequately with subjects covered in Part Vâ€”buildings of architectural and historic interest. I have some doubt of that. I am not making a party point because I know the Minister of State is touchy on the subject. Every time I ask a question he refers back to what happened in the 1950s or early 1960s. If he can find a year when I was Minister, he is even happier. I am not getting at him or at the Government in this. I only want to get the facts, and if they are as I fear I want to improve them with him and co-operatively. I will give him all the credit. I only want to get it right. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will look into the Listing and Preservation Department, which seems to be the Cinderella of the Scottish Office, operating at a far slower tempo than in England. With much less to preserve in Scotland than in England, our needs are far greater.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0095">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 49</span>
In taking over the Ministry of Works functions in relation to historic buildings, the Department may have bitten off more than it can chew. Ministers at the Scottish Office, unless they have a personal interest, cannot devote much time to this matter. That is one of the difficulties of the Scottish Office. The volume of work is not as great as in an English Department but the scope is very much Wider and it is difficult to know where to concentrate one's energies. The Scottish Development Department has a great deal to do for the welfare of Scotland and I would not like to feel that Part V of the Bill was being neglected.<br><br>
But my name is Thomas. I continue to have my doubts, and I look to the hon. Gentleman to give me visible assurances and not just the Blarney stone which he is so good at kissing. I will strike a bargain with him and will say that, if he will do as much as the English in relation to Part V of the Bill, I will forgive him for what I believe to be needless copying of the English in other Parts. I am afraid that, when we should be following the English lead in Part V, we are likely to lag behind in our bad old Scottish manner, frittering away our rather small inheritance of beauty, and that, when we should be sticking to the procedures which work so well in Scotland, we shall be meekly following the English. As so often happens in the interpretation of priorities, the Government are getting things the wrong way round again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alex Eadie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Although the hon. Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith) who has just spokenâ€”â€”</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Non-politically!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eadie</span><span class='membercontribution'>:â€”does not like English planning, he seems to like an English accent. The Committee stage will no doubt be interesting.<br><br>
What has impressed me is the question of land acquisition. I wonder how much controversy there would have been if we had dealt with the price of land acquisitionâ€”the question of making a price allied to existing use. I am associated with a mining area. I have never understood, in dealing with planning, why, when land is under acquisition, the price is not according to existing use but according to market value.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 50</span>
The hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) tried to put a reasonable and sensible argument. He did not take an Anglophobic approach. I thought I saw a smile on your face, Sir Beresford, when he mentioned St. Andrew's. I know you have close associations with it. Although St. Andrew's may be its own planning authority, I believe that the planning officer of the County Council is the planning officer of St. Andrew's as well.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir John Gilmour</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that St. Andrew's employs a consultant from outside to do its planning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eadie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I stand corrected. The hon. Gentleman and I were both members of Fife County Council. Perhaps I was wrong, but I recollected that the planning officer of the County Council was seconded at that time to St. Andrew's.<br><br>
There is anxiety about the implications of the planning procedure provisions. Part II of the Bill deals with enforcement of planning control. The present procedure is contained in Section 17 of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act, 1947. Under that procedure, where a local planning authority finds that a development, including building development or change of use, requiring permission, has been carried out without permission, it may, within two years after that fact has been brought to its notice, serve an enforcement notice. This notice must specify the unauthorised development and also such steps as may be required by the authority to be carried out in order to have the land or premises restored to the old position. The proposed procedure in Clause 15 of the Bill would make the enforcement procedure in Scotland the same as that in England and Wales, namely, that an enforcement notice could only be served by a local planning authority within four years of the date when the breach of planning took place.<br><br>
I have had experience in local government and I believe that four years is not sufficiently long in some cases. In a number of large, rural, county areas, there are places hidden from the roads, and with a chronic and never-ending shortage of planning department staff, a number of cases of breaches of control extending back well beyond four years take place. Under the present system, it
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0096">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 51</span>
is easy in such cases for the local planning authority to prove, from its statutory register and other records, that planning permission has not been granted or was granted subject to certain limitations or conditions. However, the new procedure means that, if the owner can claim that the development was carried out more than four years before it was discovered by council officials, the onus will be on the local planning authority to prove that the breach occurred less than four years before. In rural areas, the authority may have to rely on the evidence of local residents, and they may be unwilling to help, or may have moved to the district less than four years before. In these circumstances, the new procedure will make it difficultâ€”indeed, impossible in some casesâ€”for the local planning authority to enforce control.<br><br>
We should consider whether Scottish local planning authorities should be deprived of their existing advantages regarding the serving of enforcement notices. Many people will be anxious to hear what my hon. Friend has to say on this point.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 52</span>
The question of appeal is inter-related. Section 14(2) of the 1947 Act gives a procedure whereby, when an applicant appeals to the Secretary of State against a local planning authority's decision, a reporter is appointed to hold an inquiry. He hears both parties and makes recommendations which the Secretary of State may accept or reject. The new procedure is in Clause 21(3). The Secretary of State will be able to appoint a personâ€”also referred to as the reporter, for the sake of convenienceâ€”to determine certain classes of appeals. He does not, in those cases, have to submit his findings to the Secretary of State. One can sympathise with the Scottish Development Department's effort to relieve itself of the burden of dealing with decisions on all these appeals, since it takes up to two or three months to deal with one submission and appeal.</span></p>
