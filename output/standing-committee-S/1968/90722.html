	<p>	<b>OFFICIAL REPORT</b></p>
	<time>Tuesday, 22nd July, 1969</time>
	<p>[Mr. JOHN ROBERTSON in the Chair]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='legislation'>ARTS AND AMENITIES</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>10.32 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Bruce Millan)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee have considered the matter of Arts and Amenities in Scotland.</p></blockquote>
The last occasion on which the Committee discussed arts and amenities was in 1965, shortly after the publication of the Government's White Paper on "A Policy for the Arts". It is interesting to compare what we can say this morning about the progress of the arts over the past four years with what was said by my right hon. Friend who was then responsible for these matters in the Scottish Office, who is now the Paymaster-General, in the debate in 1965. Perhaps I might start by quoting a paragraph from the White Paper, which sums up some of the things we have been trying to do over the past few years. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In any civilised community the arts and associated amenities, serious or comic, light or demanding, must occupy a central place. Their enjoyment should not be regarded as something remote from everyday life. The promotion and appreciation of high standards in architecture, in industrial design, in town planning and the preservation of the beauty of the countryside, are all part of it. Beginning in the schools, and reaching out into every corner of the nation's life, in city and village, at home, at work, at play, there is an immense amount that could be done to improve the quality of contemporary life."</p></blockquote>
That is a very wide statement and if I attempted to cover anything like its full scope this morning it would be in a speech of which you would disapprove, Mr. Robertson. Therefore, I shall try to confine my remarks first to the arts in the sense in which the word is normally used, and then I would like to say one or two things about a particular aspect of amenities, namely, sport and recreational facilities, and youth and community centres. I hope to be able to show the Committee a considerable improvement in all these fields over the past few years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It should be remembered that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
improvement I shall describe has come during a period when there has been economic difficulties of one kind or another, but we have taken the view that even in those circumstances it was right and proper that a considerably greater amount of Government effort should be devoted to the field of recreation and the arts. I am sure that we shall have the support of all Members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn first to the arts. I am concerned here basically with matters which are the direct concern of what used to be the Scottish Committee of the Arts Council and is now called the Scottish Arts Council. The change of name reflects the fact that, although the body is formally a committee of the Arts Council of Great Britain, it has virtually independent status, and the decisions on how to spend the allocation of money from the Arts Council are for the Scottish Arts Council, without dictation either from London or from Ministers. It is not the Government's responsibility to determine how money for the arts is spentâ€”to allocate it between one kind of cultural activity and another, one theatre and another, and so on. This is the responsibility of the Scottish Arts Council. We maintain the balance of responsibility between the Government on the one hand, providing the framework and the essential finance to make sure that the arts flourish, and, on the other hand, the Scottish Arts Council, which has the very heavy responsibility of distributing the money made available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here I would pay tribute to the work of the Scottish Arts Council, under its Chairman, Mr. MacKenzie, and Director, Mr. Mavor. They do an excellent job for the arts in Scotland, both in terms of their formal responsibility and beyond that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1963â€“64, the Scottish Committee received Â£174,600 as its total allocation from the Government. The corresponding figure for 1968â€“69 is Â£795,000, four and a half times the 1963â€“64 figure. It is also important to notice that the proportion of the United Kingdom money going to the Scottish Arts Council has considerably increased over those years. This answers the criticism which used to be made, and is of less and less validity, that arts activities in this country are biassed towards the great institutions in London. The percentage of money going to the Scottish Arts Council has risen from 7.7 per cent in 1965â€“66 to 11Â½ Per cent in 1969â€“70.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0381">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
Without this kind of money coming to Scotland, and here I quote from one of the Reports of the Council,
	<br><blockquote><p>"â€¦ there would be no Scottish National Orchestra, no Scottish Opera, no permanent repertory theatres in Scotland."</p></blockquote>
Without sustenance of the sort the Scottish Arts Council makes available, none of these arts activities would survive. This injection of public money is indispensable if we are to have any kind of theatre, any kind of opera, any kind of music-making activity on a professional and wide scale in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, it is important to make the point that, although the Scottish Arts Council has the dominating role in supporting the arts, a tremendous amount can be done by local authorities, and particularly education authorities, not forgetting the work which is increasing all the time in music making, drama and so on in the secondary and primary schools. But if, now that we have got away from London dominance, we are to get away from dominance by Edinburgh and Glasgow and spread these activities throughout Scotland, we need the support of local authorities all over Scotland. I am very glad that the Scottish Arts Council has recently convened a conference of local arts bodies and other interested organisations and individuals to spread this message, as we in the Government have also tried to spread it to our local education authorities.

In the field of music, perhaps I should particularly mention Scottish Opera, which, in the past few years, has established for itself a tremendously high musical reputation, for which a great deal of credit must go to the musical director, Alexander Gibson. This reputation is the more remarkable because it is not confined to the public in Scotland but has been gained in a wider international field. It is an example of the way in which help to musical activities in Scotland has been increased in recent years that in our last debate in 1965, in response to an interjection by my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrew, West (Mr. Buchan), then a back bencher, the point was made that the Scottish Arts Council's contribution to Scottish Opera was going up from Â£9,000 to Â£15,000. The 1967â€“68 figure was Â£78,000, and that for 1968â€“69 was Â£125,500.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, Scottish Opera, like other
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
recipients of Arts Council money, would no doubt like to have even greater assistance. I want to put on record the tremendous expansion there has been in that assistance over the past few years, which has, among other things, enabled Scottish Opera to establish a permanent headquarters of its own in Glasgow and to perform opera not only in Edinburgh and Glasgow but in Aberdeen, Dundee and Perth, and, through Opera for All, in places ranging from Lerwick to Campbeltown. This represents a considerable expansion of this kind of activity in Scotland, added to the work of Alexander Gibson through the Scottish National Orchestra, which, as well as giving concerts in the four cities, provides music making in other parts of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot leave the subject of music without saying something about the recently published proposals of the B.B.C. and their implications for the B.B.C. Scottish Symphony Orchestra. The Government are still considering the B.B.C. proposals, and I cannot make any statement about them today, particularly as there will be a debate in the House this afternoon, but I know that the Scottish Arts Council feels very strongly that the orchestra should be retained, and is working out proposals for the future of the orchestra for discussion with the B.B.Câ€”assuming that the B.B.C. cannot be persuaded to alter its decision to disband the orchestra, an assumption which I would not lightly make at this stage. Speaking personally, I consider that it would be a very serious blow to Scottish music if the B.B.C. Scottish Symphony Orchestra were disbanded, and I very much hope that some means will be found to retain the orchestra for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In drama, the position is that the Scottish Arts Council has continued to support the various repertory theatres, some of which, unfortunately, operate in discouraging physical conditions. But there has been an expansion of help over the past few years. We also have the acquisition by Glasgow of the Kings Theatre and by Edinburgh of the Lyceum, and recently the Kings. In all these matters the Scottish Arts Council has been very active.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This brings me to the Housing the Arts scheme of assistance which was first set out in the 1965 White Paper. The scheme allows projects in places ranging from Kirkwall, where a new arts centre has been provided, and Lerwick in the north to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0382">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
Dumbarton, Motherwell and St. Andrews farther south, to be supported by money through the Arts Council. This is another very important means of spreading these activities throughout Scotland and not confining them to the major centres of population. In 1966â€“67, Â£17,000 was paid under the Housing the Arts scheme in Scotland and in 1967â€“68 this had risen to almost Â£78,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are bigger projects still to come forward, such as a new concert hall for the Scottish National Orchestra and rehousing the Citizens' Theatre in Glasgow. There is also the very important question of an opera house for Edinburgh, where the initiative rests with the Edinburgh Corporation, which, I understand, is finalising its proposals and working out the economies. The project will have to be specially considered by the Arts Council and the Government, because it will be on a scale going well beyond the normal responsibilities of the Housing the Arts fund. I cannot say more about that now, because the responsibility in the first instance is that of the Corporation, but we look forward to receiving its firm proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All this is very much on the credit side but there isâ€”inevitably, I suppose, but unfortunatelyâ€”a debit side as well. Many hon. Members may be concerned about the closure of the Alhambra Theatre in Glasgow. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State listed the building as being of architectural importance, which has meant a deferment of any proposal to demolish it. So far, unfortunately, there has not been a proposal from any individual or group or body of any sort for a scheme which would enable the theatre to be continued as a theatre. For our partâ€”and I know that this will be the position of the Scottish Arts Council as wellâ€”if anyone produces a proposal of that sort it will be very carefully considered, but at the moment I can offer little hope to the Committee about the theatre.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to another aspect of support for the arts covered in the White Paperâ€”museums and galleries. We should not forget the valuable contribution which not only the national museums, which are our direct responsibility, but also the various local museums make. I have recently seen a number of examples of
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
these which have been established in Scotland over the last few years. As centres of local cultural and arts activity and community interest, a tremendous amount can be done with the establishment of a local museum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Department's responsibility is principally with the Scottish national institutions. Here again the figures show a remarkable increase during the last few years. In the case of the four national institutionsâ€”the National Galleries of Scotland, the National Library, the National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland and the Royal Scottish Museumâ€”the total sum spent has risen from Â£534,000 in 1963â€“64 to Â£934,000 in 1968â€“69. Work is going on at present on a scheme for the improvement of the National Galleries in Edinburgh, and the plans for the new building at Chambers Street, which is to provide extensions to the Royal Scottish Museum, and also the rehousing of the National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland, are well advanced. As a Glasgow Member myself, I must draw attention to the fact that the problem of finding a site for the housing of the Burrell Collection has been solved now by the offer of ground in the Pollock Estate in Glasgow. All Glasgow Members look forward to seeing progress with this schemeâ€”</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Esmond Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is too slow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: â€”which is, indeed, as the hon. Gentleman says, slowâ€”so that we can get a solution to what has been an extremely difficult problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are some of the salient facts about progress in the arts in Scotland over the last four years. It may have sounded somewhat like a catalogue, with a little over-emphasis on the financial side, but I made that emphasis deliberately because, as I have said, while it is the Government's main responsibility to provide the wherewithal for these activities to improve and expand, the actual improvement and expansion rests primarily in other hands, those of the Scottish Arts Council, the local authorities, the local education authorities, local voluntary bodies, local arts societies and the rest. But we can fairly claim that the Government, for their part, have made a very substantial contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Leaving the arts aside for the moment, I want to say something about sport and recreational activities and the provision
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0383">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
of youth and community centres, which are another way of improving the quality of life and which have proved of value not just to the young but also to other members of the community, helping to expand their interests and to enrich their leisure time. We all have our personal scale of values, but these activities are as important as others I have been describing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again it needs emphasising that there is a great deal which the Government can do but that, nevertheless, much of the responsibility lies with the local authorities and local education authorities. In terms of effort and expenditure, the main effort is still theirs. There has been a tremendous expansion in recent years. I will take one example which I know particularly interests a number of hon. Membersâ€”the provision of swimming pools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We now have 78 indoor swimming pools in Scotland, 49 of which were built before 1930. No swimming pools were built at all in Scotland between 1942 and 1962. In the last five years, 13 have been built and we have already given borrowing consent for another 11. In other words, this expansion again is of very recent origin. Indeed, it dates from about five years ago. I recall other figures which show the same pattern. For example, the arrangements for grants to governing bodies of sport and to the Scottish Council of Physical Recreation have also been expanded. Last year we paid Â£116,000 for this, as against Â£61,000 in 1964â€“65. We have also expanded considerably the amount of money available for the grants scheme for local sports clubs. Payments rose from Â£31,000 in 1964â€“65 to nearly Â£160,000 in 1968â€“69.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. J. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for retracing the Minister's steps but the full impact of what he has just said has just sunk in. Did he say that borrowing consent had been given to local authorities for the construction of a further 13 swimming pools? Is not this a pretty strange thing to be done when such essentials as educational expenditure are being cut back through Government economies?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The figure was 11, not 13. Educational expenditure is a matter of interpretation as to what is essential or not. I include some provision for recreation as being essential to education. I may add that provision for essential educational activity in the way defined by the hon.
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
Gentleman is not being cut back.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was giving the figures for local sports clubs as another example of the considerable increase in Government assistance to local sporting activities and provision for young people. Perhaps I can quote the example of bowling clubs, which I know interest you very much, Mr. Robertson. There has been a considerable increase in Government expenditure on these in recent years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One must not forget the contribution of the local authorities here. They have the ability, at their discretion, to give rating relief to sports clubs, and I am rather disappointed that a number of them do not seem to use it in the way I would like to see. It is a matter for local decision but I would like to see local authorities as a whole being rather more generous in the provision they make to local voluntary sports bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must, of course, also mention the Commonwealth Games, which will be of importance not only in themselves but a significant stimulus to Scottish sport which will go well beyond 1970. Again, I am glad indeed that, for the provision of the Mea-dowbank Sports Stadium, the Government have made an unprecedented contribution of Â£750,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to youth and community services. Here again, the figures show a similar increase. For example, national voluntary organisations operating in youth and community services have had an increase in grants for their headquarters expenditure from Â£51,000 in 1964 to Â£137,000 in 1968. Government assistance to local voluntary youth organisations for the provision of premises at local levelâ€”a scheme involving a contribution by the local education authority to the extent of at least half of what the Government offerâ€”has risen from Â£89,000 in 1964 to Â£228,000 in 1968.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have recently introduced a scheme for giving additional priority to projects catering for young people in the 14â€“19 age group in areas of special needâ€”areas where the need for local provision is greater than elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to all this, the education authorities themselves operated, in 1968, some 817 youth centres and clubs with a membership of 81,000. The corresponding figure for 1964 were 489 youth centres and clubs with a membership of 37,000. So there again, in the last four or five years,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0384">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
provision has more than doubled. Of course, in all thisâ€”the provision of new youth centres and the capital expenditure involvedâ€”the activities of community associations of one sort and another have in general correspondingly increased in the last few years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have necessarily had to provide no more than an outline of what the Government are doing, but the pattern is exactly the same in all these activities, whether they be sport and the arts on the one hand or the support of local youth recreational and sports facilities on the other. In the last few years provision has gone up very substantially. It is, therefore, true in this sense, as in many others, that the quality of life in Scotland is improving, and has improved over the last few years. One does not want to sound complacent about what has been done. The more one is aware of all these activities, the more one is aware of deficiencies which still need to be remedied. But we can claim that a considerable start has been made to this job in the last four years. I remind the Committee that the 1965 White Paper, "A Policy for the Arts", was sub-titled, "The first steps". We have taken the first steps. We have a long way still to go, but the achievement is very creditable, and I am very happy to report it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join the hon. Gentleman in saluting the work of the Arts Council and of the Scottish National Orchestraâ€”the efforts, indeed, of all involved in working hard for the furtherance of what the hon. Gentleman called the quality of contemporary life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would want to go even further than he has doneâ€”and one accepts that he could only highlight some of the issuesâ€”by particularly saluting the extent to which, in the last few years, there have been attempts to take the living theatre in particular and live music out of Glasgow and Edinburgh into the highways and byways of Scotland. Each year at this time there are some 300 artistic or musical performances taking place arranged directly or indirectly by the sponsorship of the Scottish Arts Council outside Glasgow and Edinburgh. The Scottish National Orchestra a year ago did 150 out of 210 performances outside these two cities. In this sense I join in everything the hon. Gentleman said. Inevitably, in a subject like this, one can but highlight topics and issues, and he will understand that I want to take issue with what he was
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
saying in half sentences and throwaway remarks, as it were. I do not dissent about the achievement. Indeed, I would go further and submit, because this may well be qualified later in the debate, that perhaps the real architect of this achievement is the good Lord Goodman in another place. The policy for the arts to which the Minister paid tribute bears the marks of Lord Goodman's mind and imagination. I say that because some aspects of that noble Lord's emphasis of recent weeks may well be subjected to qualification later in this Committee, for obvious reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to take up the Minister's themeâ€”the spending of public money in the host of ways which he highlighted. We must not think that because we are spending more money we are necessarily creating more culture, more art or more amenity. I could refer him to Lord Goodman's comment on this point in the probing of the work of the Arts Council over a year and a half ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archie Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We cannot do it without money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me address myself, however, to the expenditure of public funds and the role of the State as patron, preserver, or fosterer of the good life. This is our theme. This is perhaps the only point at which we can make a contribution. In all that the Minister said, in all that is done in this field, there is one artistic achievement which stays steadily minimised in Scotland and to which not nearly enough money is devotedâ€”the creation of literary art, of books, and all that goes with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I address myself to one obviously current problemâ€”the threatened cut of the B.B.C. Scottish Symphony Orchestra. I am sure that much of what I propose to say will be echoed on both sides of the Committee. I regard the threatened curb on the orchestra as deplorable for Scotland. Hon. Members, under the leadership of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Hannan), had the pleasure of talking to Lord Hill on this subject last week. I detected in what he saidâ€”and I obtained no satisfaction when I listened to his repliesâ€”that the B.B.C. queries whether it has the old role of patron of the arts, or, at any rate, of music, which it used to have. This is a matter for debate in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0385">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
House as well as here. We must fundamentally examine whether the artistic achievement of the B.B.C., the improvement in listener taste and, broadly, Scottish culture which has come from radio broadcasting, could not have afforded an extra 5s. or 10s., which would have been money well spent. I am surprised that there has not been nearly enough public debate on this subject. I am also surprised at the inadequate degree to which Scotland was taken into discussion before this decision was announced. Was there any probe of Scottish listeners' views about the Scottish Symphony Orchestra? How do these figures who sit largely in London know what is good for Scotland? Why did the Controller in Scotland describe this proposal as "disastrous"? How right are we in assuming that there was not adequate discussion with the Scottish Broadcasting Council?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The threat to music is paralleled by a threat to what I might call speech and talks contributions. It is proposed that the present Third Programme will become a v.h.f. line network, with a listening audience of about one-third of the present listening audience. This cuts at the patronage role of the writer, the documentary producer in sound.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not suggest that the Minister can, in anticipation of this afternoon's debate, say a great deal more, but Scotland has not been adequately consulted on this matter. It will be imperilled, and Scottish culture will be imperilled, if the symphony orchestra disappears. I join with the Minister in hoping that the Arts Council will come to its assistance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take up a theme which ran through the Minister's remarksâ€”the role through contributions of local authorities to fostering the arts. I take his point that there has been a tremendous development in youth work and in community centres, but there are other sides to the picture. Let me draw the Minister's attention, if he has not seen it already, to the Circular which went to the county councils of Scotland 18 months ago asking them what they had given to the arts under the 6d. rate grant which they were empowered to make under the 1966 Act. I will not weary the Committee by going through the whole list, but hardly a county council in Scotland made any contribution whatsoever to the arts: Aberdeen, no expenditure;
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
Angus, no expenditure; Argyll and so on. We must hunt for any expenditure on the arts. Ayr spent Â£225. In the absence of my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Mr. Munro), I salute the Dumfries authority which gave Â£2,700 to the Grace-field Art Centre. But 95 per cent of the county councils in Scotland made no contribution to the arts at all under the 1966 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We do not want to be unfair to any local authority. I am particularly pleased about what has happened in Ayrshire. The hon. Gentleman will recognise that some authorities did good work under an Act prior to the 1966 Actâ€”I think that it was in 1948.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that. But the Minister said that there was to be a conference of local authorities and that their attention was to be drawn to this matter. If we are drawing up a balance sheet, as the Minister did, we must recognise that they have been very slow to act. To show that this is an impartial Committee, may I point out that in 1967â€“68 Glasgow spent Â£3,200, the equivalent of 2Â½d. on the rates. But it reached that magnificent sum by adding its expenditure on art galleries and museums.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I concede that the case of Glasgow and Edinburgh is special, but the Minister has left it very late to bring pressure on the local authorities. Far more could be done by the local authorities. In the documentation to which the hon. Gentleman referred, "A Policy for the Arts", of 1965, there is a list of what is being done elsewhere, in England and Wales. Birmingham is financing its orchestra and is planning to build a new repertory theatreâ€”will Glasgow please listen? It has given an interest-free loan to the amateur Crescent Theatre. Since 1965 there has been a series of developments in the live theatre in England which puts Scotland to shame. In particular, it puts Glasgow to shame in its attitude towards the Citizens' Theatre. The list includes the new Mermaid and the new Queens in London, the Belgrade Theatre in Coventry, theatres at Croydon, Eastbourne, Torquay, Nottingham, the Phoenix Theatre in Leicester, the Genee Theatre at East Grinstead and the Yvonne Arnaud Theatre in Guildford.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister made passing reference to the problem of the location of the Citizens' Theatre. Last year, the repertory
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0386">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
theatre in Edinburgh had 70 to 75 per cent capacity audiences. The capacity at the Citizens' was about 28 per cent. People are choosing to abstain from going into the Gorbals; there is a very inadequate public bus service. There is hanging over the Citizens'â€”I say this soberly and with concernâ€”a real threat to its continued existence. Implementation of the plan for moving to the Buchanan Street site will take, not years, but decadesâ€”and we all know it. There is an urgent need to find an alternative site for the Citizens' if that theatre, with its immense contribution to the culture of the west of Scotland, is not to disappear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to housing the arts. If I had to choose a single feature on which the Government should be congratulated, it would be housing the arts. But the striking fact is that there has been very litle expenditure on housing the arts in Scotland. In 1967â€“68 the Arts Council, under the heading of housing the arts, spent Â£362,000 in England and Wales. In Scotland, Â£77,000 was spent, of which Â£70,000 went to motherwell and Wishaw. We salute Motherwell and Wishaw, but this is a totally inadequate way of coping with the problem of Edinburgh and its opera house and the appalling plight of the Citizens in Glasgow, with its very real interest in drama. This is the disturbing feature. It could be killed, if there is not real help given.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Lawson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would not the hon. Gentleman place some emphasis on the failure of the Scottish people? If Scotland is largely a cultural desert, we cannot expect a great deal of response. Motherwell has taken a lead, along with others, but the people are largely to blame.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not for me to say whether Motherwell is an oasis in the Scottish cultural desert, but the hon. Gentleman reinforces my point, that if we put the emphasis on State finance we must use that State finance to foster a genuine local involvement. I wonder where Scotland would have been at the end of the nineteenth century and in the early twentieth century without the local spirit which produced, in particular, the Citizens?' One of the perils of dependence on the State is a weakening of the spirit of pride in the local theatre in Scotland. There is ample evidence that the problems of the small localities are matched by the problems
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
of Glasgow and Edinburgh. I do not think that these two ciities can be exempt from my general indictment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is striking that the Arts Council gives an annual grant of Â£50,000 for the Edinburgh Festival. I believeâ€”and there is evidence for this in the Estimates Committee's discussionsâ€”that the case for taking the Edinburgh Festival out of the present allowance from the Scottish Arts Council and making a distinct cultural centre would be supported by the Government if it were made out. When this was put to the Arts Council 18 months ago, Lord Goodman said that he thought that it would obtain the support of the United Kingdom Arts Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Looking at another aspect of culture, the summer schools in Scotland, with which I have been associated for some years, are built round the University of Edinburgh. The grant which they receive through the Department of Education and Science is a grant which goes to Edinburgh, Stratford, Oxford and London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that Edinburgh is culpable in its long debate and uncertainty about its proposals for an Edinburgh opera house, but there is a strong case for taking it out of the general remit of the Scottish Arts Council and requesting special treatment for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am disturbed by a feature to which the Minister made no reference, namely, the sharp decline since 1964â€“65 in the number of students in further education taking advanced courses in the arts, music and drama. If there is a curb on the B.B.C. Scottish Symphony Orchestra the figures will decrease. They have dropped steadily, both at advanced level and junior level. There is a real danger of the television age gradually affecting, not only the performing arts, to which the Arts Council's money overwhelmingly goes, but the appreciation of music and drama everywhere in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to sum up by putting to the Minister a 10-point programme. There should be advance knowledge of the Scottish Arts Council contribution to the individual theatres or groups which it is to help. I could give the Minister chapter and verse on the erratic way in which, for instance, the Glasgow Grand Opera Society has had grants from the Arts Council of very uncertain amounts over the years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0387">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
There should be a triennial system, indeed, a rolling triennial system, on the lines now applied to universities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, there should be special treatment for Edinburgh and its Festival.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There should be urgent pressures brought on Edinburgh to make up its mind about the opera house. I believe these approaches would get support from the Arts Council if supported by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There should be an urgent quest for a new Citizens' Theatre. There is no point in waiting till the Arts Centre is developed. When the site is chosen we should bear in mind that this theatre will be the centre of a very much wider catchment area than the present City of Glasgow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There should be a concerted policy for the Scottish National Theatre. I should like to see the Scottish National Theatre coming into being to match the Royal Shakespeare or the National Theatre in London, to carry the live theatre around in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe we are still in danger of just talking about the Pollock Estate as a centre for the Burrell Collection. I am very worried about what is happening to the Burrell Collection, which is housed in all sorts of strange places. The sooner a permanent home is found for it the better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should bend our best endeavours to save the Scottish Symphony Orchestra.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There should be as much attention given to the written word as to the spoken word, or to music and drama. Scotland and the whole of Britain is unfair to authors. Very few individual literary awards come from the Arts Council. The deputy editor of 	<i>The Glasgow Herald,</i> having hit the jackpot with his book "Flashman", is now well away from Glasgow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is where finance plays such a large part in the over-taxed community in which we live. A tiny amount is filtering back to the arts. We ought to considerâ€”I cannot understand why we have not done so alreadyâ€”a system for Britain similar to that in the United States, of tax exemption to individuals and corporations who make contributions to the arts. Where would we be if there had not been the Gulbenkian Foundation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tenth and Last, I say a word about education itself. We are talking about the spending of money to foster the arts and
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
appreciation of them. There should be a great deal more support under this heading for the universities as cultural and artistic centres. I do not know from where they would get money for these purposes. It is not under any heading one can find in a university diary or calendar. I mention the McEwen Concerts in Glasgow and the immensely impressive work of the Glasgow University Orchestra, composition by individuals like Thomas Wilson of the Educational Department, of Robin Orr and Frederick Rimmer, the foundation of the music archive, and the Department of Drama under James Arnott. I should like to see the universities becoming creative centres. I should like money to go to them under the simple heading of the creative arts, as is done in the United States.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member has presented a 10-point programme which is very imaginative and creative, but again I must ask, has he costed it? It would be much more convincing if it were costed. It is hardly meaningful to talk about matching the Royal Shakespeare and tax exemptions if we do not know what it would cost.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not costed this particular programme. A number of points I have made are matters of administration and a rolling triennium for the present would not increase cost, but it would allow every individual group or company to know what it will get two or three years in advance. It would allow it to book artists and theatres and to plan ahead. A decision as to where the Burrell shall be is important, but it is more important to speed up the moving in. Tax exemptions on American lines would be a major change of policy. It would be impossible to estimate this till a whole picture of the foundations in being, and what others may come into being, were available.

I pay tribute to what the universities are trying to do. I believe they could do more, but it would be wrong not to add a word of tribute to Glasgow School of Art. I served on the Select Committee on Education and Science and with the hon. Member for Bothwell (Mr. James Hamilton). I had the privilege of visiting the school in the course of our peregrinations. It came very high as a splendid centre of craftsmanship, making a real contribution to culture in the west of Scotland. Such universities and schools of art are the real

	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
centres for the future. I urge on the Government that they should have more money to back their work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. A. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the Minister and the Government on the splendid progress made in covering a great many aspects of art and amenities. The whole purpose of art and amenities is to make life more graceful and to extend the capacity of people to enjoy life. The first part of that is to enjoy good health and that involves getting rid of smoke from cigarettes and in the air. Clean air and clean living probably constitute the finest way of doing this, for the greatest art is beautiful men and women, girls and boys, moving about the towns. Human beings are the most delightful part if they move and grow gracefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A great deal of art and amenities depends on planning. The first piece of constructive planning is to get rid of dirt and ugliness which has been built up by past generations through carelessness and, perhaps, lack of knowledge. Tribute must be paid to that great professor in Edinburgh who started the idea of town and country planning and giving people the opportunity of making their environment beautiful and cultural. Even the little gardens which he started on vacant spaces in Edinburgh still provide a monument to his pioneering. His ideas have gone all over the world, and art and appreciation of beauty have benefited very largely from them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To preserve all our treasures is also a valuable part of art. Some of those treasures are being endangered. The Historic Buildings Council and the Government play a part in preserving the beauties of the City of Edinburgh, which are in danger of beginning to disintegrate. It would be a great pity if they became historic monuments merely as beautiful ruins, when in fact they could be preserved. Some buildings, parks and beauty spots throughout Scotland are in danger and must be preserved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had a letter yesterday from Lord Rosslyn. The Rosslyn Chapel is one of the gems of architecture of the whole of Europe. It is now endangered by a building firm wishing to put up unsuitable buildings on the other side of the street. I have no objection to buildings being put thereâ€”a farm is to be establishedâ€”but it would be a desecration if the building
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
were not done in such a way as to proclaim the beauty of this jewel of architecture. I have written to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State about this, and no doubt he will take steps to preserve it without my intervention, but I call attention to it now in the hope that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State will give special attention to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New buildings and factories are, fortunately, being planned for Scotland. We hear a great deal about the beauty of the Clyde being desecrated by development of industrial schemes. I am hopeful that this will not be the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Art is not only paintings. People are inclined to think that it is, but they forget such things as are around us here in this Committee Room, the building itself, the carving and the woodwork. All that is art as well as paintings. Life does not consist of looking at paintings. We should avoid spending too much money in making places to hold paintings when people can see art all around them as they walk through a town. Art permeates the whole of our life. I am sorry that the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mrs. Ewing) is not present, for I consider that a woman's hair-do can be art, and she appeared with a very striking hair-do the other day. The dressing of a table for dinner in a beautiful setting and with good food are all parts of art in which every member of the community can participate. This should be part of our investigation and promotion of art.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Motherwell (Mr. Lawson) that Scotland has been far more practical in its outlook than cultural. When the Poles came to my constituency and dances were held, a Pole would come up to a girl, click his heels, bow, and ask for a dance, whereas a miner would say, "Are you coming up?" hook his thumb and invite her in that way to dance. It may have been more sincere and genuine, but a little of the arts and graces in behaviour helps to beautify life. Some country dancing and other dancing taught in schools today has a great effect in getting young men who are clumsy, as I was when I was a youth, to develop grace of movement and a more pleasant attitude among people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is greatly benefited by the Scottish programmes on television, especially programmes of music, art, literature and plays, but some Scottish plays give much
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0389">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
food for thought. Some Scottish comedians appear to think that vulgarity is humour. They have no idea of how this offends people's susceptibilities. I am not particularly squeamish, but I think some comedians can be quite brilliant without indulging in questionable taste in the production of their humour. One or two of the kitchen sink dramas were a little on the Pierrot level, and sort of scratch programmes, which do not dignify Scottish drama. I had a letter from a man who said that if such Scottish programmes were to be put out by the B.B.C. he would emigrate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have some sympathy with him from that point of view. Even the artistes in Scotland emigrate. They do not take part in Scottish programmes. A good deal of development could take place to try to get programmes of the standard of Graham Moffat and which were works of art and history. They portrayed Scottish history and made a graceful and entertaining programme. The High Living has been a great success with everybody in Scotland and is a rival to Coronation Street, but there has never been any bad taste in it. It is good humour portraying life in the modern high flats.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The B.B.C. does a splendid job, but it cannot put on plays unless somebody writes them. I agree that encouragement should be given to people who write plays. We have not many Joe Corries in Scotland. One of the lads who wrote plays in Glasgow and stimulated the Glasgow Civic Theatre used to be a student in some of our classes. He was a labourer in the gas works originally, but he wrote splendid plays. There is no doubt that a good deal of stimulation might be given to literature in the schools. There is no reason why this should not be done. Instead of essays about the Roman Empire, students might be asked to write little dramas on what happens in their own homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The workers are artists. When I take people through the House of Commons, I point out the bronze gate at the House of Lords, which is a beautiful work of art. The workers who build houses are artists. Indeed, some of the most beautiful houses that we go into, from Traquair to Cramond, were built by workers. They put the art into them. Throughout education
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
the workers ought to be taught to appreciate that what they are doing is art. Scotland has certainly distinguished itself in producing wonderful craftsmen who are proud of what they do. It is mostly their art with which we come into contact as we move through life. We want the workers to feel a pride in their work, to see that they turn out nothing shoddy, but that everything is right up to the mark, so that we can be proud of Scotland's history in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to design in industry. Looking through any household we see industrial design production in many things from kettles to kitchen sinks and fireplaces. They are now beautiful. We look at these things all day. Therefore, they are more important than an art gallery which we visit once in a blue moon, perhaps never. So, when thinking of art, we must think of the whole of life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I was the responsible Minister, I took a great interest in the feeding of children in schools. I thought that it should be an educational process to teach children how to behave at table, how to lay a table, and good manners at table. All this is as much art as the Mona Lisa. Therefore, it is important that we broaden our ideas of what we mean by art and amenities and that we carry our minds beyond that. This should begin in the education system. Teachers should feel that everything that they do is a contribution to life and to art. If we can convince people that they are artists and can create art, we will broaden their minds and the young may indulge in other activities than juvenile delinquency when they leave school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked to approve the abolition of home lessons. I was willing to abolish them as they existed. I thought that it would be better if, instead of home lessons, people were given projects to write about in their own towns, cities or villages and to frame ideas on what they would do. After all, the Government will not create the new world; it is the people themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The great thing about modern civilisation is that people in a village can make it look beautiful. Compared with what villages and towns were like sixty or seventy years ago, a staggering revolution has taken place in Scotland. Where there were pit dumps and ugly pieces of ground we now find gardens with flowers. Children never saw these flowers when I was a youngster. There were great walls and fences round
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0390">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
them in case children got near them. Yet, flowers are growing in the streets in my constituency and people never interfere with them. That is art. People come to see the Floral Clock, gardens and flowers in Edinburgh. This is happening in every city and town. Art is part of life, and it is there all the time. We should not concentrate on pictures or even music, because that will come. But all these other things should be embodied in our educational system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have modern art, as Mr. Churchill described his kind of painting. It may be understood by some people. We have an exhibition in the Botanical Gardens in Edinburgh. I understand that a museum of modern art in Edinburgh has been approved. However, we have heard no more about it. Perhaps the Minister will be able to tell us whether the Royal High School will be adapted for this purpose or whether there are any plans for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I am in favour of the Burrell collection, paintings, their preservation and exhibitions, I prefer living art. The B.B.C. has done a wonderful job in some of its teaching of art. It has stimulated people to love music and well presented drama, and to be interested in books and literature. I hope that the Government will spread their wings further than this narrow concept of art and try to get the whole population infused with the idea that art is in all our lives. It is a question of making life graceful and beautiful and getting rid of the ugliness which may, unfortunately, in some cases be present. We should try to make our environment something of which we can be proud.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Clark Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is always a great pleasure to follow the right hon. Member for East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn). I believe that he celebrated his golden wedding the other day. I wonder if he and his wife will accept the good wishes of myself and, I am sure, the whole Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clark Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: History shows that the arts cannot be self-supporting and in general cannot be profit making. For these reasons, and because of the importance of the arts to men and women, I am not averse to subsidies being paid from public funds. As the Minister said, subsidies in recent years have risen markedly. That is, perhaps, well and good, but I must sound a note of warning. There is a limit
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
to what the State can collect in taxation and thereafter disburse, and there are many claims on public funds. In our fairly parlous economic situation, it is even more important that we have ceilings of expenditure and definite priorities. That is common sense and good husbandry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not entirely convinced that the funds allocated by the Arts Council are correctly disbursed. London receives a great deal. I do not begrudge that, because it is the capital city. However, I am not sure that other parts of England get their share.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scotland probably gets its share if we work on a population basis, but, looking at the situation from a geographical point of view, we do not do so well. The distant areas in the Highlands or in Orkney and Shetland, for example, do not need very much on a population basis, but we must not forget that they are far from population centres and their local community needs indicate that they should get higher amounts than they receive now. I hope that the Minister will look into this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Knowing that public funds are limited, and should be, will the Under-Secretary also consider other methods of raising money for the arts? This was touched on by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Wright). The day of the great private patron has passed, and the state, to some extent has taken over. So have certain commercial and other institutions in some measure. But is there not scope for further private patronage either by individuals or by companies if there were tax and rate allowances? I think that this line of thought could be explored with beneficial results all round.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Edinburgh Festival is a good institution. It has brought pleasure to many people and has benefited Edinburgh and, indirectly, Scotland, though it is difficult to calculate the benefits in hard figures. The Festival, however, seems to live a rather hand to mouth existence and it is difficult for the authorities to plan ahead. Is it possible to obtain a promise from the Government, or through the Arts Council, of payment of a certain sum for some years ahead so that the authorities who plan the Festival will know that they have so much money for next year, the following year and the year after? I wonder, too, whether it is possible for private sponsorship of certain items by individuals or
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0391">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
commercial organisations, or even local authorities in Scotland, to be arranged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Committee that Edinburgh is facing many financial commitments, and I confess to being a little fearful of the future. We have heavy road developments coming, possible airport improvements, the Commonwealth Games, rising education and housing costs, and many other items. I want to see the Festival protected, but I have qualms about the construction of an opera house at this time. I should prefer to concentrate on what we have and to improve it. This is just another question of examining our priorities. The British and the Scots are, I think, music minded, but I doubt whether they are really opera mindedâ€”certainly not in a big way. I suggest that the opera house should wait till our finances are firmer and more extensive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to a more general but related subject which may engender a little more heat. Recently we have heard of this exraordinary Report of the Arts Council Working Party on the various Acts of Parliament dealing with obscenity and recommending their repeal. I do not know what the Arts Council has to do with this subject or how it was given any remit. Nor was I aware that the Chairman, Lord Godman, was an infallible oracle on this matter. As far as I know, he has just popped up as some political friend of the Prime Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Report has opened the way for other mentors to give tongue. We have that self-appointed sage, from Milnathort, Mr. John Calder, writing to 	<i>The Times,</i> and we have the Chancellor of the Exchequer in a weekend speech. His views and advice on the subject seem just as phoney as his views and actions on economics. I think that his advice should be avoided like the palsy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Committee that this is a serious and perhaps perplexing subject, but there is no doubt that standards have slipped and ought to be raised. In my view, certain standards are necessary for cohesion and health in the nation. The arts and anybody else should be subject to those standards. It may be difficult to define them, but until the law was tinkered with by the Chancellor of the Exchequer when he was Home Secretary it was working
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
quite well in England. It seems to be working well in Scotland, and I hope that there will be no change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The courts are, and have been for years, capable of judging these matters, and I am agreeable to accepting the middle road, the view of the man on the top of the Clap-ham omnibus, or in Edinburgh on the top of the Gilmerton omnibus. Those engaged in the arts have a duty as well as rights, and I think that, to their credit, that is the view of most who engage in the arts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sudden changes in the law can operate in unforeseen ways. Gambling interests have made millions. The abortionists have made hundreds of thousands. Where the theatre and books are concerned we should remember that, unlike the Danes, whose language few speak outside Denmark, English is worldwide. This should be another consideration in judging how we deal with our standards and seek to maintain them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that no one would disagree with the hon. Gentleman that it is necessary to have standards in the arts. The difficult question is, who should set the standards? Does he agree that public opinion and taste in themselves operate a most effective check on artistic licence?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I thing that they do, but I was quite satisfied with the law in England before it was changed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who was at that time Home Secretary, and I am more or less satisfied with the law in Scotland. As I say, I accept the view of the man on the top of the Clapham omnibus or the Gilmerton omnibus, but we should not abrogate all the laws dealing with these subjects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I would make a point arising out of the question by the hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Mr. Maclennan).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can we really believe that it is wrong for the Government or the law to intervene where obscenity is involved but that it is quite right for them to dictate how we are to educate our children? I strongly suggest the time has come for rather more liberty and rather less licence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We all welcome the bias away from London to which my hon. Friend referred and the fact that, perhaps for the first time, Scotland and the non-

	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
Metropolitan areas of England are getting more of their share.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In all the discussion of local authorities in encouragement of art, I would emphasise what my hon. Friend said about the remarkable progress being made in secondary schools. Many of us are invited at this time of year to see performances and exhibitions in secondary schools, and these are a reflection of what is good, which we should remember if we are in any way critical of what local authorities have been doing. We should place on record the remarkable advances over the past decade in art and culture in our secondary schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Throughout these Sittings I have listened carefully to what the Opposition have said. Many of their proposals have been worthwhile in themselves. Many of us listened with attention to the 10 points of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollock (Mr. Wright) but they come a little oddly from those who make speeches in the country about the need for drastic cuts in public expenditure and urge the abolition, for instance, of selective employment tax, which yields about Â£380 million a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps today is not the day to bring in party politics, but I cannot resist saying that there must be a certain honesty in this matter. If we are for doing all these good things, we should have the courage to say that taxation must either remain as it is or that perhaps more funds must be found in one form or another of taxation, because it not only brings particular politicians into disrepute but politicians as a whole into disrepute if we argue for this, that and the other particular increase in expenditure but seem to be against increases in general expenditure. The hon. Gentleman, and others who should know better, should make up their minds on this issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that speeches in this Committee should be much shorter than they have been, so I shall confine myself to three particular points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I welcome the Government's decision, announced yesterday, to bring an important section of the Civil Service College to Edinburgh. Will there be any planningâ€”perhaps it it premature to pass any authoritative commentâ€”on the training of at any rate a few civil servants in the complex problems we are discussing? I should have thought that with the establishment of a Civil Service College in Atholl Crescent, sharing premises with the Conserva-
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
tive Central Office and the School of Domestic Science, a small course or a small part of the time of those attending could be devoted to studying the problems of financing the arts with which at any rate a few of them will have to deal in their professional lives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point concerns the Commonwealth Games. If there is not to be the risk of an element of fiasco, something must be done about Turnhouse Airport. It may largely be the responsibility of the Edinburgh Corporation and the Board of Trade, but at the end of the day those responsible for affairs in Scotland will take the buck. Perhaps it is too late to have an extension of the runway in time for the Games. It is certainly too late to have proper terminal buildingsâ€”not that those are a top priority. But it is not too late to enter into detailed consultations with B.E.A. about the introduction of Tridents with their automatic landing gear, and the installation of automatic landing gear at Turnhouse well before the Commonwealth Games and, I would hope, before next year's Edinburgh Festival. As one who never makes any suggestion without reference to money, may I say that most of the moneyâ€”Â£7 millionâ€”has already been spent by B.E.A. in adapting the Tridents?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My third and last point concerns something totally different, the Scottish Special Housing Association and the controversy over whether caravans should be allowed as a matter of amenity in Scottish Special Housing Association gardens. Here I speak as a local democrat. If a council elected by the voters of a particular town or rural area says that it does not want caravans in its gardens, that is fair enough, but why should the Scottish Special Housing Association, which has many virtues, act as an arbiter of taste when the locally, democratically elected council has decided, rightly or wrongly, that caravans should be allowed? I do not think that central Government politicians should impose their will. All I am saying is that the Association, for which we are responsible, should follow the lead set by the democratically elected representatives of the area and should not set itself up as an arbiter of taste. What happens in many areas is that on one side of the street caravans are allowed while there is an absolute prohibition at similar houses on the other side, the occupants of which may or may not want to have caravans in their gardens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0393">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
Because I think that each speech should be limited to five minutes, I now sit down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Steel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope to emulate the hon. Gentleman's commendable brevity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He mentioned some important matters in relation to the Commonwealth Games. While we can certainly congratulate the Government and the Minister on the increased assistance given positively through the Arts Council, public authorities and public agencies can do a great deal for the arts by setting standards. An obvious example of failure here is the terrible symbol designed for the Commonwealth Games. In this day and age in an international matter in Scotland we should be able to produce something better as a symbol than a wee mannie in a kilt. This is a very good example of a little thing where public expenditure is not involvedâ€”one is not arguing for an increase in costâ€”but where there should be a little more attention to public standards and taste.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister paid a justifiable tribute to schools and local authorities for their work in the arts, but he omitted one important section of help to the arts, namely, the work done by local voluntary amateur bodies, I have been very impressed in the Borders by the work done in the absence of very much in the way of professional help for the arts by local amateur operatic societies, dramatic societies, music societies and so on. They deserve every possible public encouragement and support. They often have to struggle financially, and we should pay tribute to their work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to voice my concern, which is shared by my colleagues and has been expressed by members of the other parties, about the B.B.C.'s proposal to abandon the Scottish Symphony Orchestra. Despite the figures given by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Wright) about musical performances outside the big cities, there are many parts of Scotland which never hear a full symphony orchestra. We must bear this in mind when we consider whether it is justified for the B.B.C. to discontinue expenditure on its own symphony orchestra, when it can give so much pleasure to parts of the country which will never have the opportunity to hear the Scottish National Orchestra. One can argue that they can tune in to the Proms or other parts of the B.B.C. service and still hear serious
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
music, but they will not have the opportunity of hearing the works of modern, or indeed ancient, Scottish composers. The Scottish B.B.C. Symphony Orchestra has a proud record in this regard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will accept that this is an intervention by somebody who is entirely on his side of the argument, but the B.B.C. has pointed out that for the 7 o'clock Sunday night concert, which one might have thought was a good listening period, the total Scottish audience for the B.B.C. Scottish Symphony Orchestra was only 5,000. In the whole year, it performed only about 6Â½ hours of Scottish music.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. D. Steel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I admit that it is a minority interest, but we come back to the point which the hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollok made very well, as to whether the B.B.C. regards itself as continuing to have a role in the patronage of the arts. I do not think that we can judge, in relation to viewing or listening figures, whether or not the B.B.C. Scottish Symphony Orchestra should continue. That should not be the argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think I heard the Minister say that there was no indication that the B.B.C. would change its mind. If so, we are justified in asking what it proposes to do about serious music in Scotland. I would feel a little less unhappy about the proposal to abandon the B.B.C. Scottish Symphony Orchestra if I thought that the corollary was that the B.B.C. would give much more support to the Scottish National Orchestra and would, by broadcasting its concerts more, enable it to be on a sounder financial footing and to undertake more expensive tours elsewhere in Scotland. But I see no sign that that is the proposal. The proposal is to save money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a matter of strict accuracy, I point out that I did not say there was no question of the B.B.C. changing its mind. I do not think that I speculated as to whether it would or not. I think I ought to get that on the record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry. I withdraw what I said. I misunderstood the hon. Gentleman. There has been no alternative proposition, I understand, from the B.B.C. to spend any savings on the B.B.C. Scottish Symphony Orchestra in supporting the Scot-

	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one has yet mentioned the effects in Scotland of the cuts in broadcasting following the recent increase in the levy on I.T.V. companies. While in general I support the idea that commercial television should pay a substantial part of its profits into the public purse, I regret that some of the forecasts of those who opposed the latest increase about the way in which the companies would react have proved to be correct. I will make one reference of which I have personal knowledge. One of the casualties in future programme planning of commercial television has been the drama series, proposed by Scottish Television, which centred on Scottish politics, with a mythical future Secretary of State. I readily declare an interest here since I was technical adviser to the series, but my job was finished since the series was well advanced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is sad that a drama series of this potential, breaking new ground, as it would have done, should be one of the casualties of the necessary cutback in broadcasting expenditure. Where such expenditure is cut back it is always the more serious works, the minority interests, the artistic programmes, which come under the chopper. This should be of great concern to us. The arts in Scotland depend very much on the broadcasting media.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When talking of things axed it is as well to welcome something new which has happened, the opening of Scotland's only new film studio, which is in the constituency of the hon. Member for Midlothian (Mr. Eadie). This is a very good development by Edinburgh Film Productions, and in watching the progress of the arts in Scotland, while lamenting the position of those things apparently running against the tide, we should welcome such developments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to say something about buildings and amenities. I am alarmed about the long delay over the possible opera house for Edinburgh. It is extraordinary that, throughout the history of the Festival, not a single new major building has been erected for the purpose of assisting it. The hon. Member for Pollok made a constructive suggestion that the whole Festival might be taken out of the general run of
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
Government assistance through the Arts Council and that we might consider whether we cannot do something to by-pass the rather fashionless way in which Edinburgh Corporation has treated the subject of the opera house over the years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Office is now administratively responsible for the grants once given by the Ministry of Public Building and Works for historic buildings. I understand that grants cannot be given to aid churches which are still being used as churches. This is a serious matter, because many congregations are still worshipping in buildings of historical and architectural interest and find themselves landed with having to make constant voluntary appeals for money to preserve them. If these congregations decided to abandon the buildings the whole cost of maintenance would fall on the public purse. This situation is wrong, and I hope that the Scottish Office will take a fresh look at the matter to see whether the system could not be changed, particularly since fewer churches are affected in Scotland than in England.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps to avoid embarrassing the hon. Gentleman I might intervene to ask the Minister to examine the case of St. Michael's Church, Linlithgow, which is a very good example of the problems which arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I declare a filial interest in that matter, and I know that the hon. Gentleman has pursued it energetically. I believe that St. Magnus' in Kirkwall has also launched an appeal for assistance.

Public encouragement should be given to local authorities which have paid a great deal of attention to amenity. In Kelso, for example, excellent work has been done in encouraging property and shop owners to accept a standardised scheme of colouring arrangements in the centre of the town and it has been very successful in the "Britain in Bloom" annual contests. This is an example that we should encourage others to follow. In Selkirk, after a little, battle, we were able to persuade the Scottish Office to give an extra grant to new local authority housing of high amenity standard in the town centre. I commend this particular effort in modern town council architecture to hon. Members who may be passing through Selkirk, because it is a good example of what can be done at a reasonably low cost greatly to improve amenity and the look of our towns. In too

	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
many towns in Scotland we have been content to throw up standardised council houses of very unattractive aspect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The City of Edinburgh has a tremendous responsibility for maintaining its architectural and historical heritage. But its approach is extremely patchy. It has done very good work on the Royal Mile, but I remind hon. Members of that terrible new building in Queen Street replacing the Mary Erskine School, completely ruining the whole New Town street. It seems extraordinary that, in our planning procedures, we do not pay more attention to aesthetic quality as well as to the size and measurement of buildings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the opportunity of this debate. It is good that we should discuss the quality of life in Scotland now and again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alex Eadie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles (Mr. David Steel) referred to the film studio in my constituency. He and I attended the opening.

During the debate I have become somewhat puzzled by the 10-point programme put forward by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Wright) and I shall want to read and examine it. One of the doubts which I have centres on the role which he suggests the universities should play. I may be doing him an injustice but I hope that we shall not talk about universities having a sort of monopoly in relation to these things. If we want to talk about arts and amenities we must talk about them for all the people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested in what my right hon. Friend the Member for East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn) said about miners and their courtesy in asking for a dance by saying, "Are you coming up? "and hooking their thumbs. Perhaps the general saving grace here is that miners are generally good dancers, and I am sure that the ladies would prefer someone a bit abrupt but a good dancer to someone gracious but unable to dance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State was right to stress the role of education authorities in
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
this regard. I think that we should look at their role in relation to the postprimary school in particular, which is most important if we want to further the arts and amenities. I remember advocating that every school should have a swimming pool when a prominent Scottish Nationalist described my campaign in derogatory terms. He called them "Hollywood swimming pools". Nevertheless, the provision of swimming pools has become an accepted part of new school building in particular and I hope that the Scottish Education Department is concerned to see that new post-primary schools all have swimming pools. We should consider not only the provision of indoor gymnasia but outdoor gymnasia as well at new schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must also consider, when we are organising post-primary education, that not only must we provide more and better facilities but that we shall have to provide them for an ever-increasing school population. With the cutting-down of smaller units and bigger school populations in post-primary schools even on the basis of cost there is a case for such provision. I believe that the provision of outdoor gymnasia should be compulsory. I hope the Government will insist on this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of money has been mentioned in the debate. I am always conscious of what can be done in schools. I remember being approached by a post-primary school which wanted to invite a Covent Garden opera starâ€”it was Joan Hammondâ€”to its prize-giving ceremony. Money had to be provided. Perhaps that is a welcome change that, instead of having politicians addressing pupils and giving prizes, the schools should try to bring in someone who can provide more culture and more art for the proceedings. I was criticised at the time for agreeing to the invitation to Miss Hammond and the money being provided, but the school was packed to capacity and afterwards children, parents and teachers all said that they had had a musical feast that day. More of all these facilities should be provided. Of course it will cost money but I do not think we can do things like this unless we are prepared to make money available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been some discussion about the drama. My wife works in drama and I remember Mr. Patterson-Whyte, my old teacher, saying that three things should be remembered, particularly by politiciansâ€”"Listen, think and reply". That was our
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0396">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
training. Perhaps the contributions we make here might be all the better if we followed that maxim, although the Opposition may be under a handicap when it comes to thinking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I, too, think of the works of Joe Corrie and words which he could have written on the morning after the moon landing:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We live in an age of science</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>And wond'rous wise are we.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>But why do we call it progress</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>While children cry for bread?"</p></blockquote>
Joe Corrie, the miners' poet, died only last year. Those words came into my mind when I heard his name mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been disheartening to repertory companies which have been trying to take their shows into various towns. The audiences for them have not been good. It has been heart breaking for them. I have seen them perform some very good plays, but the size of the audience has been anything but satisfactory. That is why my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State is correct in saying that we have to pin more faith in the schools in being able to provide the basis of this organisation in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend leaves the subject of repertory ocmpanies, would he not think it right to pay tribute to the Glasgow Citizens' Theatre for the outstanding work it has done in its achievement in introducing to the theatrical world a number of plays which have been popular not only in Scotland but in the West End of London and even on Broadway?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eadie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that Glasgow Members will make reference to the Glasgow Citizens' Theatre, but I could not agree more with what my hon.

I am anything but enthusiastic about commercial radio. As I have said in the House, I have great fears in relation to the local Press. There are also fears about whether a number of national dailies will survive. I regard journalists, to some extent, as fellow trade unionists. There is anxiety and concern among the journalists. I do not see commercial radio solving this problem. I have great doubts about it. I regard local newspapers as being very important in community life as purveyors of
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
news, particularly in a constituency like mine. If some of these papers were to go by the board, it would be very serious for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know the arguments which have been advanced. It is argued that, although advertising has increased on television year by year, there has been room for all. However, by the time commercial radio was introduced, many local newspapers would have died. I wrote a pamphlet in which I advocated commercial radio as a means of assisting the arts and culture. I could never understand why we should allow in Scotland an individual or company to have a licence to print money. I advocatedâ€”and I say this quite unashamedlyâ€”that Scottish Independent Television should be taken over and run by an organisation dealing with the arts and amenities. The profits from it would do much to further the arts in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The proposals for commercial radio are based on the assumption that local newspapers will be in a consortium with the local commercial stations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eadie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I have dealt with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of certain things that I said, members of the Newspaper Proprietors' Association came to meet me in the House. They were genuinely concerned. The promises which have been made do not satisfy me. Why is not Independent Television in Scotland taken over by an organisation dealing with the arts and amenities? Why should we allow a company or individual the opportunity to obtain a licence to print money?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been said that Glasgow and Edinburgh tend to monopolise the arts. It has been advocated that with the reorganisation of local government into bigger units it will be easier to organise and finance the arts and amenities. There are people in Scotland who believe that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to sound too depressing, because it would seem from the facts and figures which the Minister gave that things are improving. However, I wonder how much damage has been done to the arts by the legalising of bingo, not only from the point of view of the people who attend, but because of the number of halls and cinemas which have been taken over to accommodate it. I wonder whether right hon. and hon. Members opposite, who
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0397">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
played a great part in this, think that it should have happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a long way to go, but I do not think that my hon. Friend the Minister should apologise for the amount of money which the Government are spending on aid and grants to the arts. I hope that he has heard in the debate ways in which we can further the arts and amenities in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am deeply grateful to various hon. Members, and particularly to the hon. Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell), whose brevity has enabled me to speak in the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate the Minister on the content of what he said and on the way in which he presented his review of the arts to the Committee. I should like to put on record my congratulations to the Minister and his colleagues on what they have done in the past few years. The generosity of Government funds to the arts in recent years must be matched by a similar attitude on the part of local authorities and commercial or private patrons if the money needed to carry on the development of the arts which has resulted from very welcome Government support is to be found.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main subject which I wish to raise is the B.B.C's truly disastrous decision in recent weeks to abolish the B.B.C. Scottish Symphony Orchestra. My words are carefully chosen. I beg those not closely concerned with these matters to listen to what I believe is a very strong case for public opinion in Scotland to wake up and realise that the disbandment of this orchestra will have infinitely worse results than purely the disbandment of one good orchestra which broadcasts. The effect will be to remove approximately one-third of the professional musicians in Scotland who are currently engaged in the regular performance of classical music.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our major national orchestra in Scotland is the Scottish National Orchestra. We also have the B.B.C. Scottish Symphony Orchestra. It is sometimes forgotten that we have a third professional orchestra, although it does no regularly perform, namely, the Reid Orchestra of Edinburgh, which is supported by trust funds and is of a high standard. The number of orchestras will be reduced to two if the B.B.C. Scottish Symphony Orchestra
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
goes. I wish to outline the extremely serious effects of this on the substructure of musical life in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rÃ´le of the B.B.C. Scottish Symphony Orchestra is, in all respects, not similar to, but complementary to, the role of the Scottish National Orchestra, which has had an absolutely wonderful record in the past few years Its standard is well up to the international standard of symphony orchestras It has a very heavy task It undertakes most of the public professional symphony concerts in Scotland It is a superb orchestra for Scottish Opera, which is a growing and heavy commitment In addition, it has undertaken foreign tours which have done nothing but add to the prestige of the orchestra and to artistic life in Scotland That is a very full programme which no one could suggest leaves scope for the members of the Scottish National Orchestra to undertake an increased commitment. Four or five years ago the Scottish National Orchestra appealed for funds to expand its membership, not because it was too small, but because the pressure of work on its members was too great and it was necessary to expand the orchestra to allow for duplicate principals in various departments to ease the already too heavy work load.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The B.B.C. Scottish Symphony Orchestra's function is primarily to broadcast music from Scotland, but, in addition, it is complementary to the Scottish National Orchestra in that its members can do teaching work. Probably no member of the Scottish National Orchestra would be able to spare the time to do this teaching work. It provides professional musicians of high standard to take part at other musical functions, such as supporting amateur musical associations in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both orchestras are at full stretch. If evidence is needed for the B.B.C side, may I point out that this autumn the B.B.C. Scottish Symphony Orchestra has been told that its output must be raised from an average of three and a half hours to four or five hours a week. Neither orchestra has any slack in its programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to say a few words about the teaching and other side effects of the disbandment of the orchestra. The Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama, of which I am a governor, relies, to a considerable degree, for its instrumental teaching on members of the B.B.C. Scot-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0398">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
tish Symphony Orchestra. There is very little chance that musicians of equivalent professional standing will be readily available to replace the fine professional musicians who are carrying a heavy load in instrumental teaching at the academy. I do not need to detail the effects on a major institution like the academy if it is not able to provide high quality teachers of brass, woodwin and string instruments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the teaching function goes even further afield. I cite as an example the Edinburgh Youth Orchestra which, in recent years, has been very successful and has given great pleasure. It has done extremely well for those who take part in it and listen to it. The conductor of the B.B.C. Scottish Symphony Orchestra, James Loughran, has given a great deal of his personal time to training the Edinburgh Youth Orchestra. He has spent much time in rehearsing it, very much as a labour of love. What is to happen if the Scottish Symphony Orchestra goes?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I give a factual example of the effects on amateur societies. All over Scotland there are amateur performances of operas, operettas and symphony concerts, no doubt some of indifferent standard but many of an extremely high standard. I have had the experience of running one of these amateur organisations for about ten years. We performed major choral works, usually in the town of Stirling. We depended on the provision of first-class professional instrumental musicians for an orchestra. Almost all the musicians came from the B.B.C. Scottish Symphony Orchestra. Societies of this sort, which are thoroughly approved of, will not have a chance to maintain the high standard which they have built up if the B.B.C. Scottish Symphony Orchestra is disbanded and its members have to go elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must mention in passing that for the first time we look like having a professional resident ballet company in Scotland, based in Glasgow. What will happen to it if there is no orchestra other than the overworked Scottish National Orchestra, which could not undertake to support the ballet company if these instrumentalists are disbanded?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is no exaggeration whatever to say that the removal of this orchestra would be a major and disastrous blow to the whole structure of music in Scotland. That is not
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
to mention the effect on broadcasting in general. There will be another opportunity to discuss this matter, I hope, later today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Do we really want B.B.C, Scotland to consider that its only real native task is to be the production of purely Scottish music of a popular nature as such? Does none of us think that the artistic expression of a nation could be fully carried out unless we have an orchestra which can contribute to international culture from a Scottish viewpoint? The hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Dewar) rightly said that we have been told by the B.B.C. that there were only six hours of Scottish contemporary composition put on the wireless programmes last year. I cannot find, however hard I try, that that is a correct statistic. There must be a narrow description of a Scottish composer. The criterion of musicians born in Scotland may have been taken. Nothing could be more unrealistic, because many of our successful composers living in Scotland are part of the Scottish scene, but may not be Scottish by birth. The B.B.C. has a fine record of imported music which cannot be performed by other B.B.C. orchestras in broadcasting in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those who think that this orchestra can be removed with only passing damage to broadcasting are deceiving themselves. It would be a major blow to the whole of classical music in Scotland. Partly as a result of the generosity which the Minister mentioned, in the last five years we have seen a renascence of really exciting musical development in Scotland. Developments such as Scottish Opera are only a part, although they are important, of this. This is a moment when we are threatened with the removal of this famous orchestra. It would be a great blow to the development which we all wish so much to encourage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should let it go out from this Committee loud and clear that we must not allow the B.B.C. to destroy this orchestra. It must be kept because it is essential to the musical life of Scotland which we all love.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate this morning on arts and amenities in Scotland has ranged widely. That is a difficulty which confronts me in summing up for the Opposition and which will confront the Minister when he winds up the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for East Stirlingshire (Mr. A. Woodburn) called attention to the enormous breadth of this subject. He
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0399">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
happily beholds beauty in all he sees. I think sometimes he beholds it in unexpected places. I certainly agree with him that country dancing and so much else provides an amenity we look for. I am at one with him in recognising that there the honest men and bonny lasses of Scotland are to the fore. I am not sure that I would applaud, as he did, the hair-do in Scottish life.
	<br><blockquote><p>"Hair loosely flowing, robes as free</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Such sweet neglect more taketh meâ€¦"</p></blockquote>
It would be unkind to the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mrs. Ewing) if I completed the quotation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the debate we have heard several speeches which have touched on the question of patronage. Where is the new patronage, where should the new patronage for the arts lie in future? Several hon. Members including my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Wright), have called attention to the larger rÃ´le which local authorities could play. I agree that that is so, but do not let us forget that some local authorities already play an important part, as the hon. Member for Motherwell (Mr. Lawson) knows. In my constituency Perth Town Council has done great work in helping the survival and growth of the Perth Theatre, which plays such an important part in Scottish drama. A little beyond that, the Pitlochry Theatre is doing remarkably well. We have a new development of amenity in Perthshire which is very important and has been assisted recently by the opening of the great sports centre in Perth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need sometimes to bring our eyes down a little, however, to the less lofty level and to recognise and call attention to the rÃ´le which there could be for popular patronage of the arts. It always surprises me when I note the vast sums of money spent by people setting up a home, in buying a television set, a three-piece suite and a fitted carpet, to find the lack of attention they give to the provision of some cultural central point in the house. Many could quite easily afford to purchase paintings by a young Scottish artist to hang on their walls. Paintings by young artists who need patronage can be bought even now for relatively small sums.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate started with an excellent speech from the Under-Secretary of State, on which I congratulate him. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Pollok
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
made a most thoughtful and constructive opening for our side. As the debate went on it reflected the grave concern in Scotland about the proposal to disband the Scottish Symphony Orchestra. I was glad to hear the Minister's remark in his opening speech, but it was only a remark, and I hope that, before long, we shall have a clear statement of intent from the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The disappearance of the orchestra would be a terrible blow to the musical life of Scotland. I cannot believe that the Minister, who understandably has called attention to increased expenditure on the arts in Scotland, can contemplate with equanimity this loss to our artistic life, which would far outweigh the other advances he spoke of. The disbandment of the orchestra would have most serious repercussions. My hon. Friend the Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) was right to say that public opinion in Scotland must be altered to the threat hanging over us. The repercussions would be enormous. He mentioned some. There is also the fact that many of our young instrumentalists who have left the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama in recent years have joined one of the three major orchestras. Now one of those opportunities will be denied to them and they may drift south and be lost to Scottish music in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an educational problem which may be caused by disbandment of the orchestra. The academy relies on young players to supply teachers from the orchestra, for the teaching of players of orchestral instruments. Members of the orchestras devote some of their time in intervals from rehearsal and performances to the part-time teaching of students. Already it is difficult to find enough teachers. If the Scottish Symphony Orchestra is disbanded that difficulty will be much largerâ€”perhaps insuperable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the wider question of education in the arts. Some disturbing figures have emerged. One was referred to by my hon. Friend in his opening speech. Since 1965, there has been a drop of 23 per cent. in the number of new entrants for advanced courses for the art, music and drama courses in further education establishments. This number has fallen from 678 to 491. The figures appear in the Scottish Education Statistics, table 23. They fell from 678 in 1965 to 516 in 1966, to 442 in 1967 and then rose to 491 in 1968. Thus
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0400">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
187 fewer people have come forward for the advanced courses. This is far greater in importance than the number and quality of ambition shown by the increase of 49 among new entrants for the non-advanced courses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be grateful were the Minister of State to comment on these figures and also on another disturbing factor, and that is the relatively high failure rate in art and music examinations for the Scottish Certificate of Education. Could the hon. Gentleman also say to what extent appreciation of the arts is likely to form part of the curriculum for those children staying on at school in the extra year when the school leaving age is raised in a couple of years?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was some reference this morning to the importance of establishing a high quality in life. It is equally important that children at school should learn to live this higher form of life. I believe there is a great opportunity in this extra year at school to help to equip young people for moving into the wider world, to understand the best, and most constructively to enjoy the growing leisure which will probably be their privilege in the years ahead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The increase in the grants made available to the arts in Scotland has been warmly welcomed by everyone who has spoken in this debate. The Minister called attention to the growing Scottish share of Arts Council sums, growing from 8.2 per cent. in 1966â€“67 to 11Â½ per cent. now. As the hon. Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) pointed out, this is a welcome movement away from concentration on the big British centres. It is also satisfying to know that Scotland is receiving a share which is in line with its population proportion, but in this, as in other fields of expenditure and investment, statistical tidiness is not proof that need is being met equitably in all parts of the Kingdom. My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) rightly said that the remoter and more sparsely populated centres will not merit much expenditure if population itself is to be the primary guide. Often in those areas the community needs and aspirations require a much higher priority than if this is based on population proportions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must also take into account the needs of development priority where leisure and cultural satisfactions add considerably to the development of an area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
It appears that London still receives a high proportion of the money available, especially when the benefit which the rest of the country receives from the principal London beneficiaries is limited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One illustration of this is the absence in Edinburgh, the other capital city, of an opera house. I agree fully with my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South that there must be great financial caution, but I hope that a decision about the opera house problem will be reached soon. The great international opera companies plan their tours years in advance and they must know what facilities will be available in Edinburgh in future. The Florence Opera Company, which is appearing at the Festival this year, has been obliged to produce special scenery for the smaller stage at the King's Theatre. This must have involved considerably increased costs. The production will be first-class and we are all agog to see and hear it, but the operatic environment of this great Festival would be happier and healthier if the building in future were in better balance, with the large requirements of modern operatic productions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that a large investment would be required, but a capital city needs to be seen to be a capital city. If Edinburgh's is to maintain its position as a premier festival it will surely need the facility to put on full-scale operas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a further growth point in Scotland. That is the wonderful advance of Scottish Opera, which is the best thing that has happened for years in the arts in Scotland. Yet the company's future is jeopardised by lack of funds and the facilities for staging opera properly in Scotland are very limited indeed. Has the Minister's attention been called to the most interesting article in last Friday's 	<i>Scotsman</i> about the touring role which the Scottish Opera Company could take on? I will say no more about that, because time is short.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be possible, were Sadler's Wells to concentrate on London entirely, that Scottish Opera might inherit the touring rÃ´le from the Wells and become the great touring company, covering Scotland and the North of England. There are splendid opportunities here. If a relatively small part of the touring subsidy could be made available, it would transform the future of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0401">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
the Scottish company. As Mr. Conrad Wilson observed in his article, "This is an inviting thought" I hope that the Minister will have time to comment on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the last debate that we had on arts and amenities I notice that my hon. Friend in opening the debate dealt almost exclusively with arts matters, but a good deal of the subsequent debate was taken up with youth and community centres and recreation centres. Therefore, I decided to deal with those matters in my opening speech this morning. However, very little has been said about the various points with which I dealt. I will, therefore, say nothing more about them now, but I hope that the comparative silence on these maters indicates a certain level of satisfaction about the progress which has been made over the last few years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the arts. First, I should like to take up the point about the numbers of students taking advanced courses in art, music and drama. I have not had time to get a clear explanation, but the drop seems to have taken place between 1965 and 1966 for some inexplicable reason. Subsequently, the figures have remained reasonably constant and the total number of students in course is roughtly the same as over the last two or three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one point about this matter concerning the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama. When it moves to the new building, which is planned as part of the proposed cultural centre for Glasgow, the number of places available will be considerably increased.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the numbers of students, there are some spheres in which I do not think that we ought to make tremendous expansion. We do not want to turn out considerably more professional actors and actresses for what is clearly an over-crowded profession, but I should like to see more students taking music and drama and going into the secondary schools, in particular, but also into the primary schools. I have not got the figures, but the number of music students entering teaching and, similarly, drama, although the figures there are smaller, has improved over the last few years.

I am impressed with the work done in our schools both on the music and on the drama side. Sometimes on the drama side some of the more inspired work is, or was, done by uncertificated teachers. I had bet-

ter say no more about that, or I am liable to get myself into trouble. However, we need more of that in our schools than we have now.

This brings me to the rÃ´le of the local education authorities generally, apart from the support which they can give to the arts by interesting schoolchildren in them and by allowing them to participate in music making and speech and drama. This point was raised by a number of hon. Members. I can tell the hon. Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles (Mr. David Steel) that one of the first things that I did after being appointed to the Scottish Office was to address a conference of local authorities and representatives of other local arts bodies in Peebles to encourage them to spend more on the arts and to take full advantage of the money being made available under the Arts Fund. I should like to see local authorities playing a greater rÃ´le in this sphere.

No local authority in Scotland comes anywhere near the 6d. rate which is allowed under local government Legislation. Even in Edinburgh, with the substantial contribution which it makes to the Edinburgh Festival, the figure is between 2Â½d. to 3d. in the Â£. Obviously there is a long way to go before local authorities will be able to play their full part in the stimulation and encouragement of local cultural activities. They can, however, give sustenance to amateur bodies.

Here I pay tribute to the considerable work done by many amateur voluntary bodies in music and drama at local level. The Arts Council gives certain support for public concerts in providing professional or semi-professional performers to back up the local voluntary effort. Some of our best music making in the choral sphere in Scotland is done on an amateur basis, and the list of amateur societies helped by the Scottish Arts Council is very impressive.

I have taken note of everything which has been said this morning about the B.B.C. Scottish Symphony Orchestra. I shall see the remarks made this morning are brought to the attention of the B.B.C. There is obviously very strong feeling, which I share, that we must not allow the B.B.C. Scottish Symphony Orchestra to be disbanded without making substantial efforts to see that the individual musicians are retained to enable the contribution which they have made to the music and life of Scotland to continue. Any solution

	<span class='label label-info column'>49</span>
to this problem, which is not just a continuance of the present position, seems to depend on getting the orchestra and the groups of players involved more frequently out of Glasgow and the B.B.C. studios and playing a more active rÃ´le in local concerts and so on. I understand that this is also the thinking of the Arts Council.

The Scottish Arts Council gives assistance to the Edinburgh Festival. The current figure is Â£50,000. Up to about five years ago the figure was Â£20,000. Therefore, it has greatly improved. I am not sure that it is necessarily a good thing, even if the Festival Society would allow it to happen, to take the Festival away from the Society and pass it over to the Arts Council or deal with it in some other way. But we want to see the Festival sustained. Despite the recurrent financial crises, which are endemic to virtually every artistic enterprise of this kind, progress has been very encouraging over the last few years, except for the provision of the new opera house where discussions have gone on for a long time. Any festival which aspires to the standards to which the Edinburgh Festival aspires, and achieves, can only do so if it is able to produce grand opera. It will only be able to do that in the long run if it is able to house the opera satisfactorily. Arguments about where the money will come from apart, there is no doubt about this for the long-term future of the Edinburgh Festival.

The responsibility at the moment lies at the door initially of the Edinburgh Corporation. I have attended at least two meetings which the Edinburgh Corporation has had in London with the Arts Council, representatives of the Scottish Arts Council and my hon. Friend the Minister of State, Department of Education and Science. The attitude both of the Scottish Arts Council and the Arts Council in London has been extremely helpful all along. In so far as the Scottish Office has responsibility, it has also been helpful, as has my hon. Friend the Minister of State. I say that without prejudice to what the attitude might be towards any proposal which Edinburgh Corporation brings forward. The important thing is that it should finalise its proposals, cost the project, not only from a capital but also from a revenue point of view, and see what it looks like so that we can consider whether, and, if so, how, we can give
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
financial assistance to this important project. I hope that does not sound too formalistic and legalistic, but I must place the responsibility where it belongs, which is initially with the Edinburgh Corporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On housing and the arts generally, I do not accept the criticism of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Wright). Even on the figure which he gave for 1967â€“68, on a population basis Scotland came out very well indeed compared with England and Wales. However, I take his point that a lot of money was for one project at Motherwell. We would like to see a more encouraging response from local authorities to the scheme which is now available to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollok also raised a point on the Citizen's Theatre. I take issue with him on its being a matter of decades rather than years before the Citizens' could be rehoused in the new centre which, following the Martin Report, the Corporation is likely to decide will be on a site rather to the south of what was originally envisaged in Glasgow. The initial responsibility rests with Glasgow Corporation. I have had informal meetings with the Corporation on this matter within the last year, and a good deal of progress has been made. I hope that, whatever the final solution will be, there will be a final solution, and that the Corporation will make up its mind about it fairly quickly, so that some of the work can go on, because many things in Glasgow, including the rehousing of the Citizens', depends on a decision on that matter. We must not forget that the Corporation owns the King's Theatre, and certain developments in Glasgow over the last two or three years have been reasonably helpful.

Reference was made to a triennial system of grants from the Scottish Arts Council and the Arts Council in London. Although I have no authority to speak for the Council, I think that I am interpreting it right if I say that it would like to have this kind of system, which would go a little further ahead. But there are difficulties which the Council and we know in the kind of system which we now have of budgetary allocations largely on a yearly basis. I know that this is a point to which the Council attaches some importance. So far as it can give more certainty for two or three years ahead, I know that it is anxious to do so and is studying that problem. The question of patronage generally was
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0403">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>51</span>
raised this morning. I think that public patronage of the kind that we have through the Scottish Arts Council is bound to play a major, or perhaps the major, rÃ´le in the development of artistic activities in Scotland, their stimulus and their support, but I do not exclude private patronage. There is nothing to prevent individuals from sponsoring artistic activities. Some do this now, including someone who was criticised for other reasons by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison). Some individuals do this very successfully and altruistically. Commercial organisa-
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
tions, industry and so on, can also play a part. Just as I should like to see the Arts Council activities extended, so I hope that patronage by commerce, industry and individuals, both in financial terms and in terms of their interest and encouragement of the arts, will continue to prosper in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
