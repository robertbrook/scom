	<p>[MR. JOHN ROBERTSON in the Chair]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>HOUSING (SCOTLAND) BILL</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed</i>, That the debate be now adjourned.—[	<i>Dr. Mabon</i>].</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Dr. J. Dickson Mabon)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That during the further proceedings on the Housing (Scotland) Bill the Committee do meet on Tuesday 10th June and Thursday 12th June at half-past Ten o'clock and thereafter on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and on Tuesdays at Four o'clock.</p></blockquote>
I ought to explain that because of the nature of the business in the House of Commons which may be proposed this afternoon and the heavy burden which will fall upon Scottish Members in the week when we return, when we are to deal, to the best of my knowledge, with three—four, counting this Bill—substantial Scottish Measures, it would be unfair to expect Members to be both here in Committee on the afternoon of Tuesday, 10th June, and also trying to work in the House of Commons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had discussions about this through the usual channels, and I have made inquiries about the possibility of an alternative Sitting during that week. However, for various reasons which I do not want to pursue now, it would be too difficult at this stage for me to give notice that I want to sit on some other afternoon that week. Members of the Committee have other commitments, as have you, Mr. Robertson. We shall therefore have to make the best of the situation, and I am grateful to the Opposition for their substantial understanding of the position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Sitting on the afternoon of Tuesday 17th June—our first afternoon sitting—will have to be very substantial if we are to try to recover part of the progress which we had hoped to make by the end of the first week following our return. I am sorry about this, but at least by deleting a sitting one is not inconveniencing Members but
	<span class='label label-info column'>54</span>
rather adding to their ability to be in the House of Commons without changing their diary arrangements. I hope that the Committee will understand that I move this Motion with some regret, but I think that it is inevitable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the Minister made that statement. Subject to what the Leader of the House announces this afternoon as business for the week of our return, the information which has reached us indicates that there would have been a clash between important Scottish business to be taken on the Floor of the House on that Tuesday and the Committee sitting here. We always try to avoid such a clash, particularly where both Bills are important and where it is almost impossible for hon. Members to follow debates in both places at the same time. It also seems likely that there is to be important Scottish business on another day of the same week, which would make it difficult for us to have an afternoon sitting during that week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our original understanding of having an afternoon meeting was subject to an unfortunate coincidence of this kind taking place. I should like to agree with what the Minister suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I return to a point which has been raised before and which has been put before the Committee on occasions such as those outlined by the Minister of State. It seems to me that we are always attempting to cram all the business which falls to us into three days in a week when we have five days available. The circumstance which has occurred this morning is not unusual; it has occurred from time to time during the years I have been in the House and it has resulted not only in sittings on awkward or difficult days but also in all-night sittings. When my right hon. Friend is faced with such a difficulty again, I suggest that he bears in mind that there are more than three days in the Parliamentary week and tries to make a little more use at least of one of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I quickly acknowledge with gratitude the attitude of the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. G Campbell) on behalf of the Opposition. I also acknowledge what my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) said. But all I am doing is to propose to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1176">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>55</span>
the Committee that we delete one sitting—no more than that. I could not feel confident that it would be fair to bring hon. Members back to an afternoon sitting on Monday, 9th June. It would be rather difficult, in view of the fact that the tabling of Amendments might well be held up until that day. Knowing the business—here I am privy to some knowledge which may be made firm this afternoon—I believe that the Friday of the week when we return—the last of the five days which my hon. Friend claims for us instead of the three days of which I have spoken—might be a very substantial day in terms of Private Members' time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure whether Committees may meet on Fridays, but even supposing that they are entitled to do so, I do not think that that particular Friday would be a wise day on which to call a Scottish Committee to sit. I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Govan will accept my apology for this situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>DEFINITION OF HOUSE MEETING TOLERABLE STANDARD</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Amendment No. 10 proposed</i>—[20th May]—in page 2, line 27, leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>"for the exclusive use of the occupants of the house."—[	<i>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</i>.]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief, since we have lost ten minutes of our time for procedural reasons this morning, and we shall want to get on and to make as much progress as possible with the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was on my feet at the end of the last Sitting in speaking to Amendment No. 10. I do not intend to go back over the arguments which I used then, except to repeat that I am not satisfied with the reasons for which the Minister of State seeks to reject my Amendment. I refer to column
	<span class='label label-info column'>56</span>
50 of the Official Report, in which he is reported to have said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Amendment would undermine the position that we are seeking to establish."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>First Scottish Standing Committee</i>, 20th May, 1969, c.59].</p></blockquote>
He did not answer, however, why it would undermine that position. He then moved to another Amendment which he proposed to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder whether he would be slightly more explicit, as I do not think that there is any difference in what the Minister of State and I are trying to achieve in this Amendment. We on this side of the Committee seek to make the Clause slightly more understandable in its English. I appreciate that my attempt to do so may not be ideal, but I do not consider that the Clause is ideal as it stands. Even if the Minister of State will not accept my Amendment, I hope that he has had another look at it since Tuesday, and that he will elaborate his argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When he first argued his Amendment the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) made two substantial points. He said, first, that when a w.c. existed in a house it was most likely to be for the exclusive use of the occupants of that house, so that the word "exclusive" was superfluous. I put it to the hon. Gentleman that that is not quite right. It is right in a single structure, but this legislation deals with many tenement houses about which it is fair to use the term "within a building or structure".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the hon. Gentleman asserted that his Amendment preserves the provision that where a w.c. is not within the house, it has to be within the building and for the exclusive use of the occupants of that house. But, as my hon. Friend the Member for Rutherglen (Mr. Gregor Mackenzie) pointed out—I am sorry that I misunderstood him when he used the word "back land"; I had the opportunity to discuss this with him afterwards—there is a different circumstance when one may be living on the first or second floor but when access to the toilet, even if for the exclusive use of that house, is by means of a stair which can sometimes be in the open air. The Amendment would not therefore meet the point which we are trying to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another point, which is the reverse of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1177">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>57</span>
that, is that put by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Hugh D. Brown) and my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Hannan). They asked, if we made the definition too lax—and this Amendment would make it even more lax—how would Glasgow Corporation be able to proceed against houses which were, in themselves, good, but the existence of which meant that a whole tenement could not be demolished because one house in the tenement reached the tolerable standard. These are two quite different arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the next Amendment, I shall seek to improve on the wording by adding the phrase "suitably located". It is the Government's view, as I said at our last sitting, that it is essential for the standard to require a w.c. which can be reached without going into the open air. That is the intention. In order to achieve that, the paragraph is drafted as it is. What I say to my hon. Friends from Glasgow—and it is a fair point which they are making and one which we acknowledge—is that the Corporation, instead of concentrating on individual houses, and seeking the closure of those under these provisions, would look to the latter provisions in the Bill which deal with housing treatment areas. The Cullingworth Committee made this point when they recommended that, when dealing with the problem of substandard houses, greater emphasis should be given to the treatment of areas of houses rather than to individual houses within that area. That is the reason why the provision is drawn as it is and why the Amendment which the hon. Gentleman has moved, would, if anything, loosen the definition. That is not what we want to secure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Were we to accept his Amendment, it might meet some of the points which we are making, but it would still leave open the possibility that a person would have the use of a w.c. reached by going into the open air. I do not think that any of us agrees that that is a right circumstance to be called "tolerable". It ought to be improved to a tolerable standard. Although, strictly speaking, the toilet may not be within a person's house, it should be within the building and away from the elements, as my hon. Friend the Member for Rutherglen described it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember a story told by David Pryde, who used to represent Midlothian with great distinction in this House, which I
	<span class='label label-info column'>58</span>
shall not recite to the Committee just now, but it is one of the nicest stories in Parliamentary history. I will save it for another occasion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the Minister's assurances, and with my assurance that I am not attempting in any way to make the Bill more lax, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 12, in page 2, line 30, after "from", insert ",and suitably located,".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred to this Amendment in our previous discussion. Both the Sanitary Inspectors Association and the County Councils Association asked us to tighten paragraph (	<i>f</i>) so that it would be absolutely clear that not only was the w.c. readily accessible but it was suitably located. I am told that what happens now is that under Section 5 of the 1966 Act, sanitary inspectors usually proceed relying on the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"adequacy and accessibility of sanitary and other conveniences".</p></blockquote>
The Amendment would render liable to local authority action the house where the water closet is inside the house but unsuitably located. As my hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline Burghs (Mr. Adam Hunter) knows, there are some houses in his constituency where the toilet is reached through the kitchen. Often it is necessary to travel an unreasonable distance, from one part of a building to another, in order to reach the water closet. Therefore, I think that this is a sensible Amendment and I should like the Committee to accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is important. To some extent, it exposes the difficulty in which we find ourselves, as responsible Members of Parliament, discussing in Committee the location of a w.c.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can remember Aneurin Bevan saying that the advance of society was such that we should be able to watch on television the starving millions in the world. It seems that in Scotland we might be able to sit in draughty w.c.s watching on colour television, men landing on the moon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure that the matter of suitable location is very important, but I want to be certain that I have understood the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1178">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>59</span>
point. In Glasgow there are w.c.s on the half-landings. Will that be accepted as a tolerable standard provided that the w.c. is for the exclusive use of one family and not, as at the moment, shared? Would that fit into the definition of "suitably located"?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to reduce the standards at which we should be aiming but there is much to be said in favour of an outside toilet which is only next door as against one which can be reached in the middle of the night only by going down half a landing. I do not say that it should be accepted, but is it the Minister's intention that a tolerable standard will allow the location of a w.c. on a half-landing, provided that it is for exclusive use?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should not like to specify a particular case because it is a matter of discretion by the sanitary inspector in interpreting the phrases which we are inserting into subsection (	<i>f</i>) of "readily accessible" and, if this Amendment is made, "suitably located".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In general, I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Proven (Mr. Hugh D. Brown) that if that toilet were for exclusive use, it could come within the tolerable standard. In Glasgow, as we all know, it is not often the case that the half-landing toilet is for the exclusive use of one family. Usually the reason for its being on the half-landing is that it serves two or even three families on that landing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of our hopes is that in the very common case where a room and kitchen or more are located on one side, and a room and kitchen or more on the other side, and there is a single end in the middle, that single end would be converted into part of either of the two houses on either side of it, and that it might be used for this purpose. I appreciate that there would be considerable plumbing difficulties in some of the very firmly built buildings which Walter Elliott once called "castles of misery". The plumbing work required would be quite substantial, but this area could then be used for baths, w.cs., 	<i>et cetera</i>.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
he items which we are discussing will be the minimum under the law. We shall make provisions for raising the standards in different areas at different times by Resolution of the House of Commons. That is a matter which we shall discuss in
	<span class='label label-info column'>60</span>
a moment, but I should like to make the point that, by leaving subsection (2) as it stands, we, as Labour Members or Conservative Members today, are not saying that we regard that as a tolerable standard for ever. What we are saying is that we regard it as a tolerable and practical standard in today's difficulties, and we hope that any steps which the House of Commons will take after that will be to raise the standard in different areas as soon as circumstances permit us to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alex Eadie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My local authority wrote to me on this precise issue. One of the points which they made was that they felt that "suitable" should be inserted. The argument which they advanced was that they did not think that a water closet should be provided off a kitchen or a kitchenette where food was cooked, stored and possibly consumed. There are many difficulties even in addition to that, but I point out to my hon. Friend that my own local authority suggested that "suitable" should be inserted in order that this matter might be cleared up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 13, in page 2, line 34, leave out "satisfactory facilities for the" and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"adequate space for the preparation and".</p></blockquote>
In introducing all these Amendments I am in no way attempting to reduce the standards which are laid down in this Clause. I say that straight away in case anyone thinks that I am trying to make them more lax in any sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arguments which I am using in relation to this Amendment are similar to those which I used on Amendments No. 7 and No. 9 in relation to the supply of hot water. I do not intend to rehearse those arguments again in relation to this Amendment. What I want to ask it whether a cooker must actually be in the house. That is the point. Does there have to be a cooker, or may it merely be the space for a cooker and the facilities for making a cooker work? In some of the older houses, previous generations had a fixed range—either a kitchen range or a range in the living room—upon which to do the cooking. Nowadays, as we all know, far more cooking is done by electricity, and that requires an electrical power point, although in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1179">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>61</span>
many cases the occupier or tenant is not provided with a cooker. Therefore the modern type of cooker is not always regarded as a fixture in the house. As long as there are facilities and space in the house for a cooker to be fitted, one would regard the house as up to a tolerable standard. That is the simple point of the Amendment. I am not attempting to reduce the standard but trying to make it more realistic in the light of modern practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I quite accept the hon. Gentleman's concern about this matter of there being adequate space for a cooker, and not a cooker itself. On the other hand if we accepted his Amendment it would be possible for the landlord to represent to the local authority that he had provided space and that that was all that he was required to do in law. There would need to be no question of an electrical connection or a connection by gas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a Freudian moment the hon. Gentleman forgot to mention gas. Many people prefer to cook by gas, and the Gas Council will be very angry with him, although I am sure that he omitted to mention it inadvertently.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Gas is much cheaper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged. If the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) gets into trouble with the Gas Council, then my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) will be in trouble with the Electricity Council. As long as I am not in trouble, I do not mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Amendment were accepted, there would be no need to provide electric points in a house, which I am sure is not what the hon. Gentleman intends. I have taken legal advice about the phrase.
	<br><blockquote><p>"satisfactory facilities for the cooking of food"</p></blockquote>
and I understand that it means the provision of a gas or electric point for a cooker but not a cooker itself, which is normally a piece of the tenant's property. There must be the requisite space, as the hon. Gentleman seeks, and of course it also must be properly ventilated and it must be suitable for cooking. These are obviously within the general meaning of "satisfactory facilities". After that explanation, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not proceed with his Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>62</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the explanation. I become rather worried by varying support from both sides of the Committee for different methods of cooking. To put the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) at ease I will tell him that in my household we cook by gas. To that extent I have no bias against gas, although we cook by bottled gas, which is provided by private enterprise—consequently, cooking well and efficiently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the Minister of State for his legal explanation of exactly what the words in the subsection mean. They obviously cover the points which I have raised and, in those circumstances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment No. 14 made,</i></p>
	<p>In page 2, line 34, at end insert "within the house".—[	<i>Dr. Mabon</i>].</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Steel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 15, in page 2, line 36, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>(	<i>j</i>) a safe and effective system of electrical wiring.</p></blockquote>
I hope that the fact that electricity supply at the moment is a monopoly of public enterprise does not mean that I shall lose the support of the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) for this Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Amendment gives effect to a need about which I believe at least one of the major local authorities has already made representations to the Government. It is a point on which we in the Shelter Committee in Scotland feel quite strongly. In laying down the standards of tolerability of a house, it is surely arguable that some reference should be made to the state of electrical wiring, and to the availability of lighting, heating and power points in this day and age when even those in fairly straitened circumstances make use of such basic electrical equipment as television sets and small electric fires.

Once when I was a prospective candidate in the City of Edinburgh, I was canvassing a street and I introduced myself as the prospective candidate for the constituency to an elderly lady, who said, "I am so glad to see you". I immediately thought that I had made another convert, but the only reason she was glad to see me was that she wished me to go into the house and to help her disconnect an elec-

tric fire which had been connected by a thoughtful relative or neighbour on a cold winter's night to the electric light point in the ceiling because there was no power point in the house. From this electric point in the ceiling there was operating a one-bar electric fire and an electric blanket. When I touched the unit in the ceiling I found that it was red hot and could at any time have burst into flames.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that the provision of a modern system of 13 amp wiring with its built-in fuses and plugs should be the kind of standard for which we are looking if we are talking about raising the standard of houses. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will receive this Amendment sympathetically.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ought first to remove any question of there being a defect in the electrical wiring system. For new consumers that is unlawful. Wiring must conform to the Electricity Supply Regulations, 1937. When a new supply is being installed it must be, in the words of the Act, "safe and effective". I would point out that in the South of Scotland virtually all premises in the area of the Board are connected, except houses in very remote areas—and there are few of them. In the North, 96 per cent. of all premises are connected. We are trying to connect the remainder, but it is very expensive, sometimes costing much more than the figure at which the house itself is valued. Thus, while we agree that all consumers should be connected to the system, it will for other reasons, take a few years before we are able to supply electricity. Many of these houses are quite habitable even though they do not have at present a supply of electricity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it were the case that there should be a standard grant for the conversion of houses in these remote areas in the South, quite apart from others in the North, then under Part III of the Bill grants would be given. The hon. Gentleman is quite right in drawing attention to the question of wiring being unsafe and ineffective. But these are strictly matters of repair, which come under Part II of the Bill. However, if he is dealing with the type of wiring, at present we are laying down a standard which we shall seek to improve, perhaps not all over the country at the same time. We shall not wait for the slowest authority or area to catch up with the rest, for later provi-
	<span class='label label-info column'>64</span>
sions in the Bill permit different standards in different areas of Scotland. Edinburgh, for example, is pressing us that once the Bill is passed the standard applicable to them should be raised. That is a good thing, and I am happy to respond to it. We shall take the circumstances in each area and look at the evidence for raising the tolerable standard accordingly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But at the moment it would be unfair to put this into the Bill as an absolute requirement right at the beginning. I take his point that in time it should be a requirement. Very few people want to have lighting by gas or paraffin lamp. But it does not follow that everybody wants to install electrical storage heaters or even to cook by electricity. A "safe and effective" system of electrical wiring has to be qualified. A "safe and effective" system of electrical for what purpose? The first and obvious—and minimum—purpose is lighting. Even then, while I am willing to concede that that will come in time, I should not necessarily say that for a tolerable standard we must insist on it, where the person is having gas-fired central heating or is cooking by gas or has some other form of heating or does not want central heating. It would be quite wrong to write into the Bill that there must be electrical supply of that standard in every case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not dissenting from the point that we should seek to improve as we go along. All I am asking the hon. Gentleman to do is not to press the point that in all houses there must be an electrical wiring system. I agree that if it is in the house it must be safe. I agree that if it is there it must be effective. I agree that we should seek to encourage this installation under Part III. I agree that the installations should always be in repair, under Part II.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But what I am saying to the Committee is that we should not write this into the Bill at the beginning. If an hon. Member feels aggrieved that in his area the standard is low, he has recourse to the Secretary of State, after having exhausted his position with the local authority. He can say to the Secretary of State: "Why do you not promote an Order in the House of Commons to raise the standard in my area, because it is quite wrong to tolerate the situation there." That is the right way of doing it, rather than by imposing a blanket provision at the earliest stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. W. H. K. Baker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister of State has neglected one small point, and perhaps he would comment on it. He mentioned that in the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board area 96 per cent. of consumers were connected to supply. That is true. But there are two areas within my constituency which are not yet on supply, and, as far as I can see, they will not be on supply for a few years. We all regret that very much. But the point is that new houses are going up in such areas, and it is possible that the owner will wish to install a private Do-It-Yourself Startomatic, for example. If this Amendment is not accepted, and if some other provision is not written into the Bill, it will be possible to install a defective system of electrical wiring with no kind of sanction whatever. Perhaps the Minister would comment on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that my hon. Friend took the point of the Amendment—although I am not presuming to know what is behind the Amendment. It struck me that nobody was arguing about safety; they were asking, what do we mean by an effective system of electrical wiring? Everyone recognises that in certain remote parts of the country it would be unreasonable to insist that there should be an electrical system in the house. We are not arguing about that. What I am concerned about—and I think that this is the point which the hon. Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles (Mr. David Steel), raised—is that under paragraph (	<i>c</i>) we read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"has satisfactory provision for … artificial lighting, for ventilation and for heating".</p></blockquote>
Surely that covers the point. I take it that that means that, for example, there should be an electrical point in the room. Where some of the chimney heads are blocked off, unless we are quite clear that there is an electricity or gas point, we might have one of the contributory causes to the use of so many second-hand, second-rate, paraffin heaters, which can be disastrous. Perhaps the Minister would clear up that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles (Mr. David Steel) spoke of the heat engendered at one of these points. The considerable amount of heat which could be generated has resulted in questions by the fire prevention officers. Bad electrical points must come high in the list of the causes of fires.
	<span class='label label-info column'>66</span>
It may well be that part of the answer will lie in the Report, which some of. us have long awaited, of a Committee which is sitting to consider new provisions for fire prevention. This point may be covered in that Report. But time and time again in building regulations, and in other legislation, reference has been made to bad electrical fittings and points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a great responsibility on the tenants and on the Do-It-Yourself people who run long connections under the carpet from one side of the room to the other. I am not asking here for any provision of that kind. But attention should be paid to the fixed points in a house. If the ordinary occupier cares to abuse the provision, that is his responsibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to my hon. Friends for these comments. Of course, if the Electricity Board are aware of a report from the tenant, or from the landlord for that matter, that a supply is defective within the house for all kinds of reasons—neglect or having inadvisably long leads, for example—they have the ultimate sanction of cutting off the power on the grounds that the situation is a danger to the occupants because of the likelihood of fire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must not confuse this provision with the possibility that the system might be in disrepair. A house can meet the tolerable standard but be in disrepair. One could then proceed under Clause 25. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) argued this earlier, and I asked him to divide his complaint into two parts—major and minor. If it were major, I answered, the point fell within this Clause, but if it were minor, then he must look at Part II of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Hon. Member for Banff (Mr. W. H. K. Baker), who spoke about new houses, is concerned about what happens to those whose introduce rather unusual means of electrical supply into a house. He asks, how can we be sure that they are safe and effective? The answer is that the building regulations governing new houses would deal with that. If an owner is installing his own Do-It-Yourself system, he is governed by the building regulations. If the Board are doing it, they are governed by electricity supply regulations, which insist that they are responsible for making sure that installations are safe and effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a great deal of sympathy with
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1182">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>67</span>
the point made by the hon. Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles, if we were confining the requirement to lighting, although I am told that it is not always the case that people are willing to have electric lighting. Some are quite content to go on with forms of lighting which are not electrical. That came as a great surprise to me. Perhaps a great deal of education has to be done by many people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, we are not prepared to lay it down that they must have electric lighting. Paragraph (	<i>c</i>) states,
	<br><blockquote><p>"has satisfactory provision for natural and artificial lighting …"</p></blockquote>
We have not stated that it must be by electricity. The term "artificial lighting" in its different varieties is entirely up to the interpretation by the inspector and the authority as to whether it is satisfactory. It has to be satisfactory in the eyes of the authority. The landlord may think it satisfactory while the tenant may not. The tenant may think it satisfactory while the landlord may not. The deciding factor is the assessment by the local authority of whether the artificial lighting is satisfactory. But I should not like to insert this requirement into the Bill, for the practical reasons I have given, even with a further Amendment to this Amendment qualifying it only in terms of lighting. To do so would be unwise at this stage. I take the point in principle that we should be able to move towards this aim, and by raising the standards as we go along, we can achieve it, I hope, quite soon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In submitting my Amendment, I had not in mind the provision of supplies to new houses, nor was I thinking of the problems of remote areas. I recognise that the effect of my Amendment would be to cover these, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister raised the question of remote areas, may I say in passing that I have always been slightly puzzled in dealing with individual cases by the complete contradiction in policy between the two public authorities, the Post Office and the Electricity Boards. If one lives in a remote house and wants a telephone installed in that house, there is a flat rate charge for the installation. The theory is that the urban consumer is subsidising the expense of the installation of this public service in the remote areas. With electricity, that is not the case. In several cases with which I have
	<span class='label label-info column'>68</span>
dealt for my constituents, I have felt that people are often hard done by because of the policies of the Electricity Boards. People cannot afford the installation of an electricity supply, even though very often the Board leans over backwards to try to bring the cost down to as low a level as possible. This is a problem in many cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Proven (Mr. Hugh D. Brown) was quite right: I was principally concerned with the decaying properties in which there is no question of a system of central heating being installed. We are thinking not of that kind of property but of the older type of property which may have an old system of electrical wiring which is inadequate. This leads, as the hon. Member rightly said, to the use of paraffin heaters where they should not be used, or to an overloading of the present electrical system. In the example which I gave it would not be adequate to deal with the situation in terms of a wiring system for lighting. I am not quite sure what subsection (1)(	<i>c</i>) means when it refers to "satisfactory provision" for heating. If there are old fireplaces in the house which have been blocked up and there are inadequate electric power points, what is "satisfactory provision" for heating? Is it the purchase of a paraffin heater from the shop round the corner?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not at all happy about our standards on electrical wiring. They should be brought within the provisions of standard grants as distinct from discretionary grants—and they are not at the moment. I accept the practical difficulties in putting forward the Amendment. I accept what the Minister says. I hope that this point will be kept under very careful review as we go on trying to raise standards. On that understanding, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>(	<i>j</i>) has satisfactory facilities for the collection and disposal of household refuse and waste.</p></blockquote>
As I move the Amendment I am aware of some of its practical shortcomings. We are talking about these houses, and there is no provision under any of the headings for the disposal of household refuse and waste. To provide for such facilities within the build-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1183">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>69</span>
ing might seem impracticable. It would depend on what we, or those who own the houses, were prepared to spend. One thinks of a brick chute built on to a building with an opening on each landing to facilitate the disposal of the refuse from the household. It could be collected at the bottom, and that would make it easier for the local authority employees to collect it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that this discussion would be more appropriate at a later stage of the Bill, when we deal with amenity, and if my hon. Friend says so, I shall accept that, but at least he will have been warned that it will be raised at that point. All of us agree that one of the sad features of the tenement buildings in the cities is the desolation and the dinginess in the back lands and in the back courts of many of these tenements. Even if the houses themselves are brought up to the tolerable standard, many of the people in those houses, and, as we are learning, in some of the relatively new local authority houses want to get out of these houses—not because of the houses themselves but because the surroundings, the back lands repel some of the better type of citizens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If my hon. Friend has given some consideration to this Amendment, I shall be pleased to hear his views. This is a part of civilised living. The receptacles, whether in the back court or near the houses, are almost as vital for health as the sanitary conveniences of which we have been speaking. I am sorry not to be more precise. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Hugh D. Brown), whose name appears with mine to this Amendment, may have given a little more consideration to the point. I hope that I have said sufficient to draw the attention of the Committee to what I consider a real problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I sit down, may I say that I have great sympathy with the Minister and with the local authority who have to face this problem, which arises because of the lack of discipline and the lack of social behaviour of many of the tenants themselves, even though a minority. This is not the duty of Parliament or the local authority; we cannot dragoon or drill people. But there is a necessity for people living in such houses to recognise that for the overall happiness of their neighbours and friends, better use of the facilities which could be provided under this subsection ought to be made. It does not
	<span class='label label-info column'>70</span>
matter whether it is private or public property. I am sorry to say that standards in this field have deteriorated and are deteriorating.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I trust that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Hannan) will forgive what I am about to say. I am not critical of the Amendment as such. But, should it be accepted by the Government, I should be critical of the fact that we were thereby producing blanket legislation to cover all areas. I repeat, I have every sympathy with the points which the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill made regarding urban, as opposed to rural, areas. But my point is that building costs in remote areas are already higher than those in the central belt. Anything which we did by way of legislation to increase these costs, but which would be completely impractical in operation, I should wish to resist. I hope, therefore, for that reason, that the Minister will not accept the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is one point which the Minister may be able to clear up. Is this point appropriate to this Clause or should it be dealt with under amenity in Clause 58?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Hannan) said, it raises a problem. It creates a squalid impression of an area, depending on the efficiency of the cleansing system and the type of containers used. There is a problem of disposal in many areas, aggravated by the extension of smoke-free and clean-air areas and by the extension of packaging of goods, food and many other articles. We are trying to find out whether this is one of the considerations, and if so, where it is included and what is a tolerable standard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In new housing schemes, as my hon. Friend knows, there are a variety of ways of disposing of refuse. In Glasgow we have big steel containers. They are reasonably effective, although bad social behaviour still gives untidiness. Nevertheless, it is a fairly hygienic and efficient way of disposing of refuse. But in the areas which the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill and I have in mind, with miles of tenement property, where there is sometimes no access—one of these bins could not be taken through the close, never mink taking a lorry round the back to collect them—there is a serious problem. We are trying
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1184">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>71</span>
to find out whether the efficient disposal of wastage comes within a "tolerable standard", and if so, what thought has been given to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gregor MacKenzie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to clutter up this Clause with lots of additional provisions, but this is an extremely important matter and one to which we should give a little thought. It may well be that it crops up later in the amenity Clause, as my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Hannan) said. It may be that it has been dealt with already under an Act dealing with health or under an old burgh police Act, but we should nevertheless like to hear from the Minister how he proposes to deal with this problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not very happy about the Amendments moved by my hon. Friend. Perhaps we all have different interpretations but when I think of the disposal of household refuse I think of what we have in some very new and efficient modern blocks of flats where this is done by the process of incineration. I should not wish that provision to be written into this Bill, although if we read the Cullingworth Report we see that provision is made for adequate provision for the storage of refuse. I should like to think that we had added a provision about the storage and collection of refuse, because the point made by my hon. Friend is valid. Many of us here are Glaswegians and we know what we are talking about when we say that the state of the middens in the West of Scotland is pretty bad. We certainly need to look at this point. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister of State will give us some assurance that this is taken into account in this Clause or later in the Bill, or that there is provision in one of the burgh police Acts or Public Health Acts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, am glad that my hon. Friend the Member for Maryhill (Mr. Hannan) put forward this Amendment. It brings us a little deeper into the increasing depths which we encounter in this Measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far we have been talking about an effective system of lighting, but there has been no exact definition of what an effective system of lighting is. We have mentioned tolerable standards of disposal without giving any definition of the word "tolerable", because I think we all agree that it is almost impossible to define some
	<span class='label label-info column'>72</span>
of these words in any exact fashion. Now we are talking about satisfactory facilities for collecting household waste and refuse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a matter on which I am receiving a great many complaints., What is household refuse? At one time, I imagine, most of us thought that household refuse was refuse which came directly from the household and particularly the type of refuse which was associated with the cooking of food. But if a bed mat and a pillowslip are flung out of the window into the back yard, is that household refuse in the same sense as the potato peelings? If the Minister is to define household refuse to include all refuse that comes from a household, perhaps he will give us some necessary guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another difficulty in my hon. Friend's Amendment. He refers to household waste. Again, what is household waste? Two or three years ago we passed another Act covering this point when dealing with the removal of waste materials from households or garden and their being deposited in the countryside. That Act is in operation and is proving very effective. Does it mean that we should be taking similar steps with regard to the cities?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the Corporation of Glasgow are trying to deal with that problem. When an individual puts refuse into the bin at the back door which the Sanitation Authorities do not regard as refuse which they should collect, it is left, and the tenant or occupier of the house is forced to use his own means of getting rid of it. There are obviously many gaps in our social legislation, particularly at local level, and I hope that when my hon. Friend replies he will be able to give guidance to those who are faced with the enormous task of getting rid of this waste, especially during the period of the year when hedges are being cut and the grass is being cut, for all the cuttings have to be disposed of. To dispose of it means the payment of a price for the collection of the material from the private owner or the tenant. But this is a question of the local authority protecting itself against this mounting problem. It may be that my right hon. Friend will be able to give us some good advice on this increasing problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>73</span>
for Banff (Mr. W. H. K. Baker) that it is not easy to apply the same rule to congested West Central Scotland, and particularly to Glasgow, with its tenemental buildings, and to the rural areas. As the result of a Government Working Party Report in 1967, we have sent out some advice to local authorities, in a circular dated 16th May, 1967, about the problems of storage, collection and disposal of household refuse and waste.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not an easy problem and we need some substantial legislation of a United Kingdom character to deal with it in terms of general principle. Great strides have been made, as my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Hugh D. Brown) said, in the disposal, in modern terms, of waste which formerly had to be buried in coups and thrown into rivers and lochs. It can now be disposed of in much more suitable ways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But we ought not at this stage to make an Amendment of this character. It is true that Cullingworth referred to the storage of waste, which is a very important matter, but the collection and disposal of it is a matter outwith this Bill and a subject about which we should be concerned in another context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Ruther-glen (Mr. Gregor MacKenzie) was right when he said that there were powers under local Acts to make improvements. But even proceeding under Sections 12, 13 and 14 of the Glasgow Act, 1960, which applies only to Glasgow, one would be dealing only with ash bins—although that is important, of course. But I take the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan that more should be done, for example in the rehabilitation of many back courts. It is all very well putting the bins or the storage places in order, but, as my hon. Friend said, we are limited by the size of the closes as to the kind of containers which we can get in and out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I confirm that even using these local powers, it would be useful for local authorities to look at Clause 58, as my hon. Friend suggested, if they want to rehabilitate these back courts. During the war many of the railings were removed between one property and another, which meant that a whole area suddenly became desolate. In Possilpark, where I used to live, we had next to us what was called a private court—a wally close with china tiles. This private back court had railings, and could
	<span class='label label-info column'>74</span>
thus be kept tidy, and grass grew there. We played there, and it was a much more pleasant place than the rest of the back courts, which were one great, desolate mass of neglected land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under Clause 58 the local authority could proceed with the rehabilitation of some of these back courts. More important, under Clause 59, we could repay them, at least in part, for the money spent on such rehabilitation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
1 do not suggest to my hon. Friends that this is an insignificant matter, but I feel that it would be inappropriate to put it into this Clause. I hope that they will accept my assurance that powers exist, in Glasgow and in other authorities, for the provision of storage space, with particular reference to ash bins, and that under Clause 58 they can rehabilitate back courts. It is very important that we should look at the whole problem in British terms, in regard to the improvement of standards of storage, collection and disposal of domestic waste. We are studying this matter at the moment, and it will involve separate legislation. We have not been asked by the Sanitary Inspectors' Association, for example, to make this Amendment, since they know that we are proceeding, under a different heading, to deal with this matter in a long-term manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that, given that assurance, my hon. Friends will feel content that their Amendment has sufficiently probed the Government's intention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I have tabled this Amendment as it is not clear to me what is implied by the word "wholesome" and what its legal interpretation is likely to be. I have also tabled the Amendment in order to protect the interests of Edinburgh. The City has been somewhat shabbily treated by the Government on a number of fronts, namely schools, exclusion from development area status, rate support grant and

However, it has been lumped together with a lot of other authorities in the South-East and is no longer its own master.

I have never yet had a firm answer to my question, what happens if some of those authorities want fluoridation and Edinburgh does not. Who wins and which view prevails?

In my opinion the people of Edinburgh are quite right. Personally, I have a rooted objection to having drugs or other substances pumped into me by one method or another, except in cases of dire necessity. Let anyone who wants fluoridation buy his own pills and pellets and put them in his own drinking-water or other beverages.

But it is quite clear that by his proposed Amendment he is seeking to narrow the meaning of wholesome in a quite unacceptable way. If this Committee were to accept his Amendment, it would virtually mean that provided there was no fluoride in the water, that water was wholesome. That would be an extraordinary conception, and certainly not one which the Committee would find acceptable. Furthermore, I take head-on issue with the hon. Gentleman on this point of fluoridation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have no objection to the hon. Member taking issue as long as it comes within the matter we are
	<span class='label label-info column'>76</span>
discussing. I do not wish him to go too wide on this point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would be very far from my intention, Mr. Robertson, but the point to consider is whether wholesome water could possibly mean water untreated with fluoride.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this connection, I recall having been told in all seriousness by a colonel at the West Point Military Academy that fluoride had the effect of weakening the resistance of the individual to Communist brainwashing. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman would not go so far as that, but I certainly find his argument quite unacceptable, and he should do the Committee the justice of explaining why—if he proposes to press this Amendment—he thinks that water clear of fluoride is pure, wholesome or of a sufficiently high quality to be provided in houses of the standard which we are trying to ensure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to add a word in opposition to this Amendment. The plain fact is that the artificial fluoridation of water supplies has been practised for over 21 years and in the United States affects more than 50 million people. During all that time there have been campaigns against fluoridation by such organisations as the John Birch Society and the Ku-Klux-Klan, and other bodies of the lunatic fringe. I am surprised that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) does not know what the words "pure" and "wholesome" have been taken to mean.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the judgment given by Lord Upjohn on behalf of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the case of the Attorney-General of New Zealand 	<i>v</i>. Lower Hutt City Corporation he said that for practical purposes and as a matter of common sense there was little difference between the adjectives "pure" and "wholesome". He added that although the water in this particular corporation's area was, no doubt, "pure" in its natural state, it was very deficient in one of the natural constituents to be found normally in water in most parts of the world. The addition of fluoride added no impurity and the water remained not only water but "pure" water and became a greatly improved and still natural water containing no foreign elements. So far as I know, that is the highest case that has dealt with the question of fluoridation.

Kilmarnock is the only area in Scotland
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1187">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>77</span>
which has been studied in this matter and a report is about to be published which shows that since Kilmarnock stopped the fluoridation of its supply, there has been a considerable increase in dental decay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the hon. Gentleman's Amendment would be to remove from the South-East Water Board the possibility, in their judgment, of adding fluoride to the water supplies. This would be a great mistake. It must be left to their judgment, in the light of the latest medical and scientific knowledge. We should not give way to this pressure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very much tempted to become involved in this argument, Mr. Robertson, in spite of your strictures from the Chair and the fact that I am the Minister in charge of the Bill. However, I shall desist from that temptation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Dealing with the point of my hon. Friend the Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Mr. Maclennan), as I understand it, there has never been a definition in England or in Scotland, in English law or in Scottish law, of "wholesome". On advice given to me this morning, "wholesome" has always been taken to mean that the water as such will not cause harm to anyone who drinks it. I am also advised that originally, in the old days, when water-borne disease was prevalent, its purpose was not just to remove harm but also to do good to the citizenry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am much obliged to my hon. Friend the Member for Caithness and Sutherland for pointing out that the Amendment is defective, not for the reasons advanced by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) as such, but in its phrasing. I would never quarrel with an hon. Member on that matter, because I get into trouble myself when trying to compose Amendments without any legal advice. I am sure that he does not mean that wholesome water is solely and exclusively water, however else it may be contaminated, to which fluoride is not added. I am sure that is not his intention, but that is what it would mean if we incorporated the Amendment in the Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not follow the hon. Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles (Mr. David Steel) into the arguments that he advanced, although I personally agree profoundly with them. We are making a grave mistake in not doing this more often
	<span class='label label-info column'>78</span>
throughout the country. The decision at the moment is that each local health authority—not each water authority—must decide whether or not this step can be taken. If there is no coincidence between the numbers of the health authorities and the water authorities, this cannot arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another argument against this Amendment is that it is not right that in statute we should select a place for special consideration. I come back to what I said earlier, when the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South nodded in agreement, that if we were to change circumstances in Edinburgh or any other part of Scotland, we would use our power under Clause 2(2) to vary or extend the circumstances of the provision of Clause 2(1). It would be wrong in Clause 2(1) to identify any place.

Finally, Edinburgh Corporation is still opposed to fluoridation. It has substantial influence with the South-East Water Board. Edinburgh Corporation, which was formerly a joint water authority with Midlothian, still has a majority of the membership of the seats of the South-East Water Board. It can hardly say that it is no longer the master in its own house, as the hon. Member said. It has no proposals in hand to fluoridate the water in the area serving Edinburgh. I repeat that there is no urgency about this. The position is quite clear about the local health authority. It would be wrong to vary it in subsection (1) as opposed to subsection (2), and the hon. Gentleman ought not to press this Amendment. Should he do so, I shall have to ask my hon. Friends—and, indeed, some of his hon. Friends—to support me on these arguments of principle, not on the fluoridation but on what I have been arguing otherwise, so that we do not incorporate this in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clark Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I propose to continue this battle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several hon. Members referred to what happens in America. I do not care what they do in America. I am concerned with what happens in Edinburgh. The city does not want fluoridation, and the medical officer of health was quite clear on that point. It is not clear to me whether he may continue to order the water board not to fluoridate the Edinburgh supplies. It is not at all clear. Even though they have a majority on the water authority, this may
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1188">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>79</span>
not always be the position. There might be a meeting when some of the Edinburgh representatives were away or sick.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment is correctly drafted. It was drafted by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) and is, no doubt in order. I believe that the City has been ill-treated by this Government in the many ways that I have mentioned, and I am trying to protect it. I am prepared to vote on this issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman consider what would happen if we accepted this Amendment? Never mind its merits; never mind all my arguments. Let him consider what would happen if we put it in the Bill.

I have argued that we should not have any reference to this in this Bill, just as I argued that we should not have sanitary regulations dealing with the clearance of sewage as such. It deserves a Bill on its own, as this deserves an entirely different vehicle of legislation.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
A substantial point is involved in this Amendment, as it raises fairly wide issues as to how the Secretary of State may
	<br><blockquote><p>"from time to time vary or extend the criteria set out in the foregoing subsection".</p></blockquote>
The Minister of State has already referred to this matter on earlier Amendments, although he has not elaborated on this point, and I should like to go into it more deeply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of this Committee will recall that the Cullingworth Committee Report laid down two standards for houses—one a tolerable standard, and the other a satisfactory standard. Only the tolerable stan-</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>80</span>
	<p>the part of Edinburgh members or even because they had changed their minds, which is possible with some Edinburgh councillors. Then, if the water was supplied to every house in Edinburgh, every single house in Edinburgh would fall below the tolerable standard and would be subject to compulsory acquisition by the City. There is Socialism for you! Every single piece of private property in Edinburgh that had a tap would be open to this acquisition. The hon. Gentleman surely does not wish to have such back door municipalisation. I appeal to him in the interests of the owner-occupiers of Edinburgh not to perpetrate this outrageous revolutionary and Marxist act.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clark Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, but I did not follow the Minister's speech. It would mean that there would be no fluoridation of the supply because it would be contrary to statute and there would be recourse to the courts. There is no question at all of houses being taken over.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put</i>, That the Amendment be made:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 1, Noes 14.</p>
	<p>dard is written into this Statute.</p>
	<p>I appreciate that the Cullingworth Committee, in the two standards which they put forward, regarded their tolerable standard as a condemnatory standard, which is the precise purpose of the tolerable standard which is being laid down in Clause 2. At the same time, it is worth recalling what the Cullingworth Committee said when they were discussing the satisfactory standard. I emphasise that this is in relation to the satisfactory standard and not in relation to the tolerable standard.</p>
	<p>In paragraph 89 of chapter 3, the Report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The 	<i>Satisfactory Standard</i> is not an optimum: it is a standard which we think is the minimum which can be regarded as acceptable for existing houses today and in the immediate future."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1189">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>81</span>
Therefore, I think that this must emphasise—and everyone in the Committee will agree with this—that the standard which we are laying down in Clause 2 is the absolute minimum standard. It must be the aim of all of us—including the Government—and I hope that here we shall have the assurance of the Secretary of State—to move towards what the Cullingworth Committee laid down as a satisfactory standard. We only regard the minimum standard as tolerable at the moment because it is, of course, relative to the housing problem which we face at the present time. We appreciate, as Cullingworth appreciated, that to go a higher standard than a simple, tolerable standard would create difficulties with certain local authorities.</p>
	<p>Therefore, I should like to have an assurance from the Minister of State—which I am sure he will give; as, indeed, he has indicated on earlier Amendments—that the standard which we are laying down in this Clause is definitely the absolute minimum standard and that he will strive toward meeting the satisfactory standard as laid down in Cullingworth Report.</p>
	<p>We must also get from the Government some clarification of precisely what is meant by these words, "from time to time".</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacKenzie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does it mean precisely the same as in Amendment No. 20? In Amendment No. 20, which is in his name, the hon. Gentleman uses the expression "from time to time". It has probably been drafted by one of his hon. and learned Friends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would have been happier if the hon. Gentleman had given me a little time to elaborate on this. I thought he would have realised, in listening to me so far, that I am not in any way criticising the use of the words "from time to time". He cannot have been listening. I want the Minister of State to explain what he means by "from time to time". I shall be very happy to explain what I mean by "from time to time" when I reach my Amendment. I do not think that these two references are necessarily related because the qualification of "from time to time" obviously applies strictly to the context in which it is placed in the Bill. As I am quite sure the hon. Gentleman realises, I am devoting my
	<span class='label label-info column'>82</span>
remarks to the particular context of this phrase "from time to time" in this subsection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want the Minister of State to tell us how often he expects these standards to be varied and how often the criteria will be varied. I ask this in relation to two points—first of all, in relation to the standards themselves. The point which I have particularly mentioned in my opening remarks on this Amendment is that, while we accept this minimum tolerable standard for the present, over the longer term we are looking forward to meeting the satisfactory standard as described in the Cullingworth Report. Therefore, the first question I wish to ask is: how often will the standards themselves be varied in striving toward this higher standard?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second question is: how often does the hon. Gentleman envisage these criteria being varied geographically? Subsection (2) says,
	<br><blockquote><p>"… in relation to the district, or any part of the district, of"</p></blockquote>
a local authority. My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North (Earl of Dalkeith) raised this point on Second Reading in relation to the City of Edinburgh—I think that I am right in saying that the hon. Member for Midlothian (Mr. Eadie) raised similar points—and said that certain local authorities were already operating above this minimum tolerable standard. Therefore, in the very early stages of this Bill becoming law, there will be pressure from certain local authorities to have these standards raised for their own particular authority areas in order to meet the standards which they themselves are operating at the present time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to go on to raise one or two specific points of variation—both variation in standards and geographical variation. First, could the Minister of State tell us if the local authority itself must apply to him for variation in order to have an order laid in the House of Commons, or will the Secretary of State himself take the initiative in varying criteria in relation to different local authorities?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can see that in cases of variations in the standards themselves, the initiative may well be taken by the Secretary of State himself with his general oversight of housing standards in Scotland, and I hope that he will always exert pressure to raise these standards. This is very important. I would imagine that the initiative in cases
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1190">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>83</span>
of geographical variation will rest with the specific local authorities themselves. I should be grateful if he would say how he sees this working out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, there will be a gap in time scale between the passage of this Bill and the time that, by resolution of each House of Parliament, these standards may be varied. What will happen, in that interim period, to authorities which are already operating above the tolerable standard? For example, I pose the practical problem which has been put to me by one local authority. What is the position of houses in a particular local authority area which has had houses closed as substandard, under standards which are higher than those set in this Bill? In theory, because these houses were closed under a standard higher than that set in this Bill, it could be possible for those houses to be re-opened as they comply with the absolute minimum standards laid down in this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This point has been made to me. It may not be a valid point, and it may not be possible for this to happen, but certainly there are some local authorities which do see this possibility. Of course, there are local authorities which want to see these standards raised for their own areas, in order to avoid that happening, and, in the longer term, to make sure that they can continue to apply the higher standards which they have been accustomed to apply in recent years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said all that, I appreciate that the points which I have raised affect, in particular, those areas which are operating a higher standard than the standard which we are laying down in the Bill. I appreciate thoroughly the position of particular local authorities, notably Glasgow who, with this minimum standard because of the concentration of the problem which they have in that area, will find it difficult to reach even this minimum tolerable standard. I appreciate the difficulties facing those authorities and the reasons why we cannot have as high a standard absolutely as many of us would like to see.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be grateful if the Minister would answer these points. They are wide points, and they are points of principle and importance which affect the whole of the working of this Clause, and they are not
	<span class='label label-info column'>84</span>
confined strictly to this particular Amendment. That will answer many of the questions which we, as Members of the Committee, have in our minds about the way in which this Clause will work, when it comes into effect, and, in particular, about the way in which we shall progress with our housing standards in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Ruther-glen (Mr. Gregor MacKenzie) about the usefulness of the phrase "from time to time" in other parts of the Bill. That is quite right. I think that the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) is moving this Amendment for two reasons. One is that perhaps this phrase in this context is not necessary, since it is clearly implied by past legislation. Secondly, on the basis of the Amendment he has proceeded to ask me a number of questions which I shall try to answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I take the first point? I certainly agree that where phrases are written into other parts of this statute or any previous statute, we ought not to have an excess of words. Against that, there is the argument, too, that for the sake of the lay reader we should make things clear as we go on. There is always this balance to be struck between how the Bill reads to a non-legal person and how the Bill should be drawn, tight and legally correct, but at the same time with no superfluity of words. Having regard to that, I will look at this point closely. I am prepared to advise the Committee that we do not need the phrase "from time to time" in this subsection. But I do not want this argument turned against me at a later stage. In this subsection I think that the Amendment is a fair one to make, and I recommend it to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that it was the primary intention of the hon. Member just to ask me all these questions. I confirm that under the Bill the initiative for making these orders lies with the Secretary of State. Of course, in practice, he will listen to the representations which are made from the individual authorities concerned. Where, for example, there is evidence, presented either to these authorities or to the Secretary of State, that in a particular area hardly any houses fall below the standard of the Bill, it will be time for an order to be made for that area, unless an order is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1191">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>85</span>
to be made for Scotland as a whole. The initiative lies with the Secretary of State, and he will consult any local authorities in whose area the order will apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman raised an interesting point about houses which have been closed and yet do not fall below the standard. I am advised that we know of none. There are various arguments about this, but under past legislation if someone has managed to make representations to get closing orders on houses above these standards, then perhaps he deserves our congratulations and admiration. My advice is that that has not been possible. But irrespective of whether it has been possible, the fact is that if hon. Members look at Clause 66 and Schedule 5, they will see that if a closing order has already been made on the basis of the present statute and is in operation, that will be carried forward as applied in this Bill. There is no question of closed houses being notionally re-opened. The hon. Gentleman put that forward as a hypothetical possibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I have answered all the points raised. I agree that the Amendment is a reasonable one to make and I hope that my hon. Friends will agree with me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 104, in page 2, line 41, leave out "vary" and insert "improve".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The significance of this Amendment will have been appreciated by the Committee. I do not think that I need dwell on it. At first reading it would appear as if
	<br><blockquote><p>"from time to time to vary or extend"</p></blockquote>
offered alternatives, but on a closer reading of the subsection it clearly means a variation of the various sub-headings. I am one of the most unsuspecting of hon. Members, but it could be that under other Administrations, other Secretaries of State, they would not accept what I believe to be the intention here, which is merely to vary. The word "vary" could mean a change in any direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Remarks have been addressed to the previous Amendent, many of which, I think, could apply to this, about the two standards. Reference has been made to Cullingworth. But, as time goes on, we and the local authorities will want to raise and improve the standard of tolerability. It may be done over a period of years. My view is—and I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister of State and the Committee
	<span class='label label-info column'>86</span>
will agree—that this is at least a reasonable Amendment which will make quite clear what are the Government's intentions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I be permitted in passing to make reference to the next subsection which, of course, refers to the orders giving effect to this situation." They will not be effective unless they have approval of a Resolution by each House of Parliament. Is my hon. Friend quite sure that that form of Resolution is the correct one to give effect to subsection (1)? What about the negative Resolution? Are there not some merits in that procedure. At least it could be debated in the House on a Prayer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some of us, while not necessarily naturally suspicion, want to know what is meant by "vary or extend". Perhaps the best illustration I can give is that in the Housing Acts, where there is mention of a statutory obligation to review rents; everybody now recognises that that means that they go up. Here we are dealing with a fairly new provision. To "vary or extend" may well mean that, for physical reasons connected with buildings, and because of some of the difficulties which we have already discussed, some local authorities will want to vary the standard in a downward direction, if that is the right way of putting it, by lowering the standard. It might be regrettable, but there might be a case for it. But I am assuming in general terms that when the Minister talks about varying or extending he means improving the standard that we have been discussing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Hannan) read quite rightly into my remarks on the last Amendment that what I am hoping for, when these orders are made and the standards are varied, is that the variation will always be in an upward direction. I should hate to think that it would be possible to vary the standards in a downward direction. All our debates on these varying standards have shown that most of us want to see them higher still, and I look forward to an assurance from the Minister of State that there is no likelihood of these standards being varied in a lower direction. I therefore support the sentiments behind the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I accept absolutely the point made concerning variation.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1192">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>87</span>
Variation ought to be upwards in all cases. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Hugh D. Brown) said that some authorities might for good reasons want to vary downwards. But as far as I am concerned, that would not happen, and I hope that all future Secretarys of State will make sure that that would not happen. The standard should be put up and not down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the point, however, that the Bill does not say that and that therefore we cannot go to the courts or complain as Members of Parliament that the Secretary of State has not obeyed an order. I cannot hold any Secretary of State to what I am saying this morning. I appreciate that it must be in the statute. Since the Amendment was put down on the Order Paper and since this doubt has been raised that there could be a variation downwards, I have tried hard to think of a word which could be inserted to overcome the difficulty. I am not satisfied that the word "improve" would achieve the objective which we are seeking. Therefore I am prepared to try to find a substitute phrase which means, beyond doubt, varying upwards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps we might discuss the point which my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Hannan) has raised on the Question, That the Clause stand part of the Bill, as there is no Amendment to subsection (3). I take his point that if we do not change the word from "vary" it will be all the more important for discussion in the House of Commons to be on the Affirmative Resolution procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, as Ministers—and my hon. Friend was a distinguished Whip some years ago, as was the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Gordon Campbell)—we know the difficulties of Governments in relation to the promotion of Orders. I might, therefore, suit the position for Scotland if the procedure were the other way round, that is to say a negative Resolution by Prayer pleading against an order being imposed. I give the assurance that I will look very closely at the wording, because the intention of the Government is that the orders varying the standards should always vary them upwards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I am speak-

ing for hon. Members on both sides of the Committee when I say that we could not have had a more forthcoming assurance from the Minister of State that improvements would be made. I had difficulty in finding the right terminology. I have on my notes two or three phrases—"in an upwards direction" or "to raise the standard"—but I thought that I might be getting into the song, "To Raise the standard on Braes o' Marr", and somebody might suggest that I had gone over to another political party. But since my hon. Friend has given his assurance and has underlined the importance of the form of Resolution, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a very good debate on the various parts of the Clause and I do not intend to go back over any debates which we have had on Amendments. I should like to ask the Minister one question. If a house is defective in any of the respects detailed in subsection (1), I presume that it will be possible for a closure order to be put on that house. That seems clear and it certainly tightens the position from that which has existed previously, but I noted in making a comparison with previous legislation that in Section 5(1) of the 1966 Act a certain amount of discretion was left with the local authority in the interpretation of these standards. It reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"and the house shall be determined to be unfit for human habitation if, and only if, it is so far defective in one or more of the said matters that it is not reasonably suitable for occupation in that condition."</p></blockquote>
I am interested to know why this element of discretion has been removed from the Clause. I appreciate that it may well be to tighten it up, and that is a good reason which should be accepted. But the point of view has also been put to me that while removal of discretion makes certain that discretion is not used in a downward direction, and to that extent it is tightening up, equally it means that by using this element of discretion, some authorities were tighter in their interpretation of the previous standards of a house being unfit than were some others. There is a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1193">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>89</span>
suggestion that some local authorities would like this discretion to be retained to enable them to interpret these standards always in a higher direction. That use of the discretion gave rise to the reasons behind the last Amendment which I moved. I have not put down an Amendment on this point but it would help clarification if the Minister explained why this dicretion has been removed. As I said, we do not want to see the discretion used in a downward direction; we want it used in an upward direction. It has proved useful to certain local authorities in the past. I shall be glad to have the Minister's comments on that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is probably the most important Clause in the Bill, certainly in this Part of it. While supporting the Clause, I want to express my regret for the necessity to be discussing in this year such minimum requirements in a house to classify it as tolerable. I do not wish to provoke any hon. Members on the other side of the Committee—there is scarcely anyone there to provoke—but the debate has to be put into perspective. Just for the record, I would point out the shameful neglect there has been of action to solve the housing problem in Scotland in the past. For example, I reckon that the Conservative Administration in those wasted years lost us 100,000 new houses. In other words, there are 100,000 families, who are living in the houses about which we are talking and which we are trying to bring up to a tolerable standard, who could be enjoying houses with all the modern amenities and facilities. That is certainly no exageration, and it is one of the main reasons why in the big authorities, such as Glasgow, what has conditioned the number of houses being cleared has not been the standard but the availability of new houses. The rate of house building has determined the standards, and that is regrettable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore I take every opportunity to remind some of our friends that it may be depressing at times that we are discussing this problem—and that one of the reasons that we have to do so is the failure of Conservative Governments in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An impression is growing that the house building programme in Glasgow is declining because of the number of forms which have to be filled up at the Government's request. This amazing statement seems to
	<span class='label label-info column'>90</span>
have been made to a sub-committee of the Estimates Committee, no less, when they were in Glasgow on Monday of this week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be the last person to attack or criticise an official. I have a great respect for the integrity and ability of the city architect, and I am not attacking him. But I am certainly attacking the Progressive Conservative Alliance who allowed officials to make such statements as excuses for what many of us suspect to be not fantasy but a deliberate run-down of the house-building programme in Glasgow, since they have to appease their political supporters in their attempt to reduce the rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me tragic that we should be discussing tolerable standards, and arguing at this stage about whether a house should contain a w.c. or a hot-water supply. It seems regrettable that we should have to do this in the light of all that has gone before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I may add that Glasgow councillors have often in the past been accused of being interested only in jaunts abroad, or in providing themselves with free lunches. It seems regrettable that this image is to be counteracted by the rather inhospitable reception which was given to the Estimates Committee when they visited Glasgow on Monday this week. At a time when the Progressive Conservative Alliance of Glasgow are meeting M.P.s—tomorrow, as a matter of fact—in an effort to get more money, it seems to me shocking and outrageous that when an important subcommittee of this House visit Glasgow nobody apparently is interested in meeting them, let alone looking after them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is regrettable, in this context of housing, that all of us should be asking local authorities to do something which should be quite unnecessary in this year of 1969. I hope that some of our supporters outside will be heartened by the rapid increase in the number of houses which are being cleared and that perhaps in future we shall not need to argue about what constitutes a tolerable standard for housing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacKenzie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Hugh D. Brown) was right when he said that it was exceedingly unfortunate that in this year of grace we should be discussing tolerable standards for houses, particularly those in the West of Scotland, which many
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1194">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>91</span>
of us, including the Minister of State, know so well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was encouraged to hear the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) also say that we must regard these tolerable standards as being of a bare minimum and must proceed on that assumption. I hope that these standards will be rapidly improved. One of the crimes of the previous Administration was their failure to clear some of the slums in the West of Scotland as quickly as they might have done. This, as my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan, pointed out, certainly had a bearing on the number of houses which were closed under the tolerable minimum standards at that time. If we look at the problem of tolerable standards, we see that if the present Government are allowed to continue building their record number of houses—we should not be mealy-mouthed about taking credit for this from time to time—then these standards will have to be improved, not just from time to time but rapidly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope, therefore, that my hon. Friend will look at subsection (3) and at the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Hannan) that we shall have to do this by Affirmative Resolution in the House of Commons. I do not claim a great knowledge of procedure; it has always been somewhat beyond me. But if there is to be any form of improvement at all—I am sure that there will be, for the reasons just advanced—we shall want to do it as quickly as possible. I like to see an Affirmative Resolution when I am uncertain of the Government's attitude. But since subsection (2) makes it clear that these orders will improve the standards which have been laid down, I am sure that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee will wish to make them as quickly as possible. Bearing in mind the argument put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill, and replied to by my hon. Friend the Minister of State, about the time-consuming processes of putting forward Affirmative Orders of this kind, I hope that the Minister of State will look again at subsection (3) to decide whether that is the best form of procedure available for introducing these improvement orders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 2 can be welcomed
	<span class='label label-info column'>92</span>
with a certain amount of pleasure, since I think I am right in saying that it raises the standard higher than that which will be required South of the Border. This is a situation which all of us in Scotland will welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to echo a point made in a previous Sitting by the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith). I should certainly like to see us moving as quickly as possible towards the higher standard, from "tolerable" to "satisfactory" housing, laid down in the Cullingworth Report. If we look at the list of minimum conditions and facilities required for a tolerable house contained in Clause 2 there are obvious, glaring omissions, quite apart from those debated earlier today. For example, we do not require as a minimum facility the provision of a bath or shower.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may not be so in the big cities, but in certain parts of the country I am convinced that substantial public investment in improving old, but structurally-sound property can make a major contribution to our housing problems. But in these days of rising standards of living and, as I said on Second Reading, of rising standards in new council housing, I do not believe that spending public money on raising houses to this level of tolerability will in itself make a contribution to the overall housing situation in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not take part in the earlier debate whether the word "vary" or the word "improved" should be used, but I think that this point is of significance. While welcoming and proceeding with the Bill, I hope that we shall not be complacent and that we shall want to see a much higher standard specified, so that we can make an additional contribution to the standard of decent and satisfactory housing in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Small</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome this Clause, and I hope that the Minister of State is emphatic in raising these standards. Housing should be a social service, but in fact it is not. I have never known houses which were built in the private sector unless from motives of profit. We are dealing with a marketable commodity. The young people in his country during the post-war period have been paying too much to purchase a home for themselves—£800, £1,200 or £1,400 for a room and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1195">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>93</span>
a kitchen, well below the standards described here. In the market-place, therefore, the Bill will offer a degree of protection, a certificate of worthiness, for those engaged in finding a home for themselves. To that degree I hope that the Minister of State is resolute. Now we have removed several discretionary weaknesses which kept these standards low, he has my 100 per cent. support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Scotstoun (Mr. Small). Quite apart from what he said, the strength of what he said demonstrated the passion which many of us feel about the low standards of housing which we in Scotland have endured for far too long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The local authorities have not been disturbed by this Bill, even though they lose a large area of discretion. Under the provisions of paragraphs (	<i>b</i>), (	<i>c</i>), (	<i>g</i>) and some of the other paragraphs there is always an element of discretion. But Clause 2 as it stands is a very big step forward. This is not paralleled in England, but is a great step forward in trying to bring national standards, minimum standards, of housing in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard representations from the Convention of Burghs who have said that they are content with the Bill as drafted in this context of standards. The county councils have generally welcomed the Bill. They have put forward some detailed and, as is usual from them, constructive comments. Edinburgh regards the Bill as satisfactory. We have had discussions with Edinburgh. The Committee will recollect that on Second Reading the point was made to me that Edinburgh already operates a higher standard, in which case we should want to use subsection (2) in order to promote that higher standard by identifying Edinburgh in the order by which we are varying these different standards upwards in particular areas. Glasgow raised a number of detailed items, and in principle they welcome the Bill. One is not surprised at that in view of the fact that in Glasgow we have the biggest core, quantitatively, of bad housing in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities in the past have complained that a need for discretion on a wider scale than had previously been the practice meant a subjective judgment by themselves, leading to uncertainty and hesitation when they had to go to court—
	<span class='label label-info column'>94</span>
as they will have to go to court under the Bill—to prove to the Sheriff that they were right in what they judged to be the situation for a clearance area or for proceeding with demolition and closure. They will be protected to a large extent by Clause 2, as they were not protected in the past, by having definitions which we are trying to make as exact, positive and objective as we can. I confess that no statute can be written which completely eliminates an element of discretion, but we reduce that element to the minimum possible. We shall seek, in the succeeding orders flowing from this Clause, to reduce that area of discretion further and to try to get more positive and objective assessments and higher standards of assessment. I give the Committee that assurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We respect to the important point about subsection (3), I shall look at that again. It is probably wrong. If we make the Amendment to subsection (2) which I promised that we should try to make, and have a provision that we are always varying upwards, I take the point that it will then be useful for hon. Members who wish to complain to do so by the negative Resolution procedure. If what I said in the first instance is right, we shall always be varying upwards. Hon. Members will tend not to object to that, and if they wish to object, they can do so by the negative Resolution, so that the burden on the Minister and on the Government of finding Parliamentary time is removed. It is a question of the hon. Member finding time, and not of the Government finding time. I accept that. It is a fair point. I will discuss this point with the Secretary of State. I promised that to the Committee. We shall see whether we can amend subsection (3) in accordance with the wishes of the Committee.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be convenient, to save time, if we took at the same time Amendment No. 46, which is a similar Amendment concerning houses in disrepair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a probing Amendment. If we consider the opening subsection of the Clause, including these words, we see that it is rather haphazard in that the action of a local authority would be based upon
	<br><blockquote><p>"any information in their possession".</p></blockquote>
Either a local authority should have adequate powers of entry and inspection in order to know beforehand the condition of the buildings concerned or, if they have no adequate powers, we ought to be considering that in Committee. My own impression is that local authorities have adequate powers to enable them to examine areas and buildings. They would have a good idea of the conditions of all the houses in question before they took this action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An important point arises under subsection (3). The local authority are required to except any site of a building, the houses in which are all up to a tolerable standard. It will be quite a difficult job for a local authority to draw an area which does not include a single building which contains even one defaulting flat. They could not do this job thoroughly without good information. We should like to ask the Government whether the local authorities, in the Government's opinion, have adequate powers of entry and inspection to obtain all the information which they would need to define a housing treatment area as required by the Clause. If that is so, is it necessary to have these words in the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will be convenient. All three Amendments refer to the same principle. I hope that the Minister will accept these Amendments with the same expedition as that with which he accepted the previous Amendments. Failing that, would he at least undertake to give the same assurances as those which he gave on the previous Clause?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These Amendments are all concerned with the proportion involved in
	<br><blockquote><p>"the greater part of the houses".</p></blockquote>
Following the last Amendment, the Clause reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where a local authority on consideration are satisfied that the houses, or the greater part of the houses."</p></blockquote>
These words are giving some concern to the Glasgow local authority. The Amendments further concern houses under clearance orders, demolition orders or closures. In various areas or portions of areas of Glasgow, where some houses have already been cleared, there might not remain the requisite number of houses to meet the words, "the greater part of the houses". If this first Amendment were to be
	<br><blockquote><p>"of such lesser proportion within that area as the local authority"—</p></blockquote>
after consultation with the Secretary of State and after an agreement has been reached—it would give greater flexibility to that phrase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to subsection (4), where the words are:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1197">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>97</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"For the purposes of subsection (1) … a house in respect of which a closing order has been made"—</p></blockquote>
Here the reference is only to that category of house. The words which I have quoted are to be amended, I hope. The local authority officials think that a better Amendment would be to make reference to Section 15, I think it is, of the previous Act, because that Section refers not only to houses and their closing orders but to demolition orders as well. The other Amendment deals with clearance areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me try to illustrate the problem. We have a street in the city of Glasgow within an area or section which is designated as a treatment area. Already, because of some dangerous factor in a building, the local authority may already have taken down two closes, each with 12 houses, and the total number of the houses in the proposed treatment area may not reach the designated number. I know that that is an Irish way of putting it, but in that event it would give the necessary qualification for that area to be dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know if I need to labour the point. It is a bit technical, but I hope that my inadequate words have pinpointed the problem. There are local authorities—particularly Glasgow and there may be other local authorities facing the same problem—whose representatives feel that in various areas throughout the city clearance areas have already been effected, and the houses which have been cleared should be counted in the total. Not only should the houses which are provided for under closing orders in the Bill be included in the total going to make up the greater part of the houses, but those which are in process or for which demolition orders are being sought should also be included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the content of the three Amendments which we are taking together. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister of State will be able to accept at least the Amendment providing for the previous Section of the Act—not only closing orders but demolition orders. I would be grateful to hear his views on the question of cleared sites, because that is an important point. Otherwise it would mean that a progressive, forward-looking authority like Glasgow, which has taken action from time to time in bringing down two closes, could be penalised. We think that they should get credit for those vacant spaces in the total which is to be considered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Hannan) for raising this question. I must confess that, on reading this Clause, I raised in my own mind the particular points which he made, and I considered putting down an Amendment along the same lines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, looking at this more closely—I hope that this is where the Minister of State can give us some clarification on this point—it would appear that from the way in which the Bill is worded, the local authority, in designating a housing clearance area, has complete discretion as to what lines it draws for the boundaries of that housing clearance area, or treatment area. Therefore, if it has its own authority and discretion to do that, presumably it can, in practice, manipulate the boundaries of that particular area—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a bad word.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely why I want to know. Otherwise, I would have great sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's Amendment in the way in which he has framed it, and would support it. I imagine that this was what was in the Minister of State's mind. If the Minister of State says that this is a bad argument, it merely indicates what I think of the Minister of State, because this is the kind of argument which I thought that he would have in his mind. If he thinks that it is a bad argument, it must be a reflection of the opinion which I have of the Minister of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said it is a bad word, not a bad argument. I do not like the word "manipulate" in this context.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That shows the danger of the Minister of State intervening from a sedentary position. I took him up wrongly, and I agree that "manipulation" is a bad word. My hon. Friend the Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. G. Campbell), with his great experience of Parliamentary matters, suggests the use of the word "adjust". This is certainly a word which I shall adopt. I would have thought that in practice, the local authority, when designating a housing treatment area, might well have considerable discretion, ability and practice to adjust the boundaries of that area in order to avoid
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1198">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>99</span>
the very genuine and practical difficulties which the hon. Gentleman has raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I support the hon. Gentleman in the spirit of his Amendment. I had intended to raise this point in the debate on the Clause, but now it has been covered by this Amendment. I think that it is a valid point, and I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two points here with which I shall deal in turn. First, I will take the point about the 50 per cent. If the Committee will look at the Cullingworth Report, they will see in paragraph 124:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We envisage a new provision for 	<i>Areas of Unsatisfactory Environment</i>".</p></blockquote>
It goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"An Area of Unsatisfactory Environment is an area in which the majority of the houses fall below the Standard for a Satisfactory House…"</p></blockquote>
The logic of the position is, I think, quite apparent. The Bill provides that when houses fall below the tolerable standard, one can do one of two things, and one must make up one's mind as to which it must be. The first choice is to serve closing or demolition orders and deal with the houses individually under Part I of the 1966 Act, which is amended by Clause 17 of this Bill. Or one can decide—which is what Cullingworth was advocating—to include them in a housing treatment area under Part I of the Bill with a view to their demolition or improvement. In the second course, the Cullingworth Committee—and we agree with it—took the view that if a majority of houses were of this kind in any given area, wherever one wishes to select an area—and I take the point that the selecting of areas is a very important part of housing strategy—to do this piecemeal is quite wrong; it must be decided, consciously and deliberately, that one is going to do H.T.A.s or one is going to deal with them individually.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One would, therefore, choose a housing treatment area where the majority of houses were below the tolerable standard and where, therefore, one would be taking away good houses—one does this with reluctance—to clear out a whole area. What the Amendment seeks to do—and this disappoints me in a way; I hope that this is only a probing Amendment—is to lower the figure of 50 per cent. and say that, even when it is below 50 per cent., where the authority is willing to go to any
	<span class='label label-info column'>100</span>
percentage below that, that should be allowed within a housing treatment area. In effect, it says to the Government, "Even though the majority of houses are good, we should have the power to sweep them away." That is really too much. It is fair to say that they should use closing and demolition orders on the minority of houses which they have in that area and, where they choose the majority, they should have housing treatment areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps it is my fault, but I think my hon. Friend misunderstood me. Glasgow cannot overhaul 50 per cent. of her houses all at once, so an area is selected in which they know that there are houses not reaching the tolerable standard, but not up to the 50 per cent.—not up to the requisite number within an area. There may only be 47 per cent. or 48 per cent. Yet they would like some flexibility because there may be another spot near at hand for which, with the sanction and agreement of the Secretary of State, an exception might be made, to allow them to deal with the selected area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I think that if my hon. Friend looks again at Clause 6, he will see that where the authority is able to acquire land adjoining a housing treatment area, if it is necessary for the satisfactory development or use of the area, that will deal with intermediate cases. What I am suggesting to my hon. Friend is that while I admit that it is very difficult when dealing with tenements, where the percentage is three out of 12, three out of eight, and so on—I am not saying that it is an easy judgment to make—we are not just passing legislation relative to Glasgow; we are passing legislation relative to Scotland as a whole, and it would be wrong, with our housing shortage for many years to come, to lower the percentage below 50.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have given a major concession to Glasgow Corporation, as a result of the representations which they made to the Department in January and again in April, in including subsection (4) of this Clause. Subsection (4) is directly because of Glasgow's representations. I have conceded this point to them, where we will count a house, which is still standing but which has been closed, as a house in that area. My hon. Friend goes on to argue that we should count the houses which are not there as within that area. He is really stretching credibility too far. We have tried very hard
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1199">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>101</span>
to convince Glasgow of the unfairness of this suggestion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How much more can I concede? It is my natural god nature which leads me into these treacherous situations. Here we have conceded that we can count a closed house. Why? Because it is there. It has been deliberately closed for all kinds of reasons—reasons which perhaps ought not to persist in advance of an H.T.A. being arranged. That is fair. I think that that argument was sound and one that, after discussion, we readily conceded to the Corporation.

But for the Corporation to argue that once it had proceeded, under Section 15 of the 1966 Act, to take a house, demolish it, and then say, "Oh, by the way—we forgot. We are coming back again. We want to deal with the whole area, and we would like these houses to be counted as well", is going too far. I think that what the Corporation has to do is to decide which areas it will have as housing treatment areas. If it wishes, it can use Clause 6 to help it in the marginal cases, where there are intermediate difficulties between the 50 per cent. and a number lower than 50 per cent., and also to decide what it is going to do about demolition. If it wishes to acquire a house for the purpose of closing and demolishing it, then it ought to do this consciously, in the knowledge that it is not going to have a policy of wholesale demolition in that area. In fact, it should be knocking down bad houses where the majority are good. That is right. But if it is going to knock down a lot of houses, then that ought to be declared a housing treatment area.

I have tried to explain this as best I can, and I do not wish to appear awkward to my hon. Friend, but I think that we have moved quite considerably. I welcome the fact that the Glasgow Members have been invited to meet the Glasgow Corporation officials and councillors tomorrow, and I hope that, as a result of these discussions, the Members who so loyally defend their city—irrespective of who is running the city—will look again very closely from the point of view of this Committee at the arguments which are deployed to them. They may say that Glasgow is wrong in some respects; they may say that Glasgow is even more right than they had thought in the first instance. But in this case, it would be a mistake to depart from Cullingworth's proposition about the situation of
	<span class='label label-info column'>102</span>
more than 50 per cent. and it would be a mistake to ask for a further count, and, in an Irish way, as he said, count the houses which were demolished as if they were existing houses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is a little unfair to my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Hannan) and myself. I am not willing to defend all that the local authority in Glasgow do. I had doubts about it before the municipal election, and certainly since then I am not prepared to defend everything they do.

My hon. Friend is just a little unfair. My hon. Friend the Member for Maryhill and I feel that, by not allowing this flexibility, we might well give a laggard authority the chance to say, "We cannot define this as a housing treatment area because the majority of houses are either up to the standard or closed". If we are thinking here of the compulsory acquisition of land, we may give rise to objection simply because we have adjusted the boundaries in such a way as to meet the requirements of the Act even though they do not, in themselves, make sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not necessarily advocating that houses which are not there should also be included, but we want to make sure that, in fact, action is taken to ensure that houses are either raised to the tolerable standard or closed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend confirm that he is not thirled to the second Amendment? He accepts my point that, if the Corporation wish to do this, they ought not to have gone ahead with demolition but should have treated the whole area as one. I realise that he is not abandoning his first point. I know that he feels very strongly about that. I accept that. But do I take it that he follows my argument on the second point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that is right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that I do not follow my hon. Friend's argument. Glasgow may by order have had to bring down in Glenfarg Street otherwise good houses because of structural faults. They are within the area known as Cowcaddens. If Glasgow had proceeded to deal with a section of that area and had found themselves short of the requisite 50 per cent. perhaps by four or five houses within that area, what would have been the position? Would they be able to proceed? Houses

may be brought down to leave gaps here and there because they are dangerous structures or because of some other faults. These gaps are within one of these areas. Machinery, earth-moving equipment, men and materials may be brought in, but it could be that that area is disqualified because of the shortage of houses which once were there, to use the Irishism. Because of the action of the local authority in dealing with these houses at an earlier stage, it seems to me that they are being penalised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
