	<div class='title'>HANDICAPPED CHILDREN</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed</i> [	<i>This day</i>], That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>4.0 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Bruce Millan)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had spoken about teacher supply in special education and had dealt with points which hon. Gentlemen had made on that aspect which are relevant to the Clause. Perhaps I could now say something about accommodation. In the first instance, if we are thinking of accommodation for children at special schools—that is, the over-fives—then, generally speaking, we can say that the position in Scotland is satisfactory. There may be areas in which the accommodation is hardly adequate. There may be cases in which the buildings are not as good as they could be. The same kind of criticism, of course, might apply to ordinary schools. But, in terms of the total number of places available, I think that the situation is reasonably satisfactory. The figures were given in answer to the hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) on Monday of this week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These places, of course, may be at special schools in separate establishments, and they may be in special classes in other schools. The position varies from one area to another, partly depending on the number of children involved in the education authority area. In areas in which the numbers are small, one very often finds attachment to an ordinary school; in other areas, one finds special accommodation separate from the ordinary school provision. Generally
	<span class='label label-info column'>530</span>
speaking, we can say that the position is satisfactory in respect of day schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is very difficult to make a general statement about residential accommodation. I would certainly not accept that the general position is unsatisfactory, but, of course, there are difficulties both with particular types of disability, which may affect only small numbers of children, and with areas where, because of the sparsity of the population, the numbers of children likely to be involved in special education as a whole are fairly small. In these areas there is sometimes a difficulty in providing adequate provision without residential accommodation, and in residential accommodation there is sometimes a difficulty in getting sufficient children involved by combining areas, for example, to build up a viable school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Looking at the situation of the country as a whole, and taking account of the grant-aided special schools, the position is certainly improving. I do not feel that the position, generally speaking, can be described as unsatisfactory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Brewis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the hon. Gentleman a question about maladjusted children? Apparently there is quite a high proportion of maladjusted children, but I understand that there is only one residential school for them in the whole of Scotland, which is somewhere near East Kilbride. Should we not have a bigger provision in that category?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are some difficulties about the definition of maladjusted children. The kind of provision which is best made for these children depends a good deal, of course, on the extent of the maladjustment. First we must consider whether they need to be classified as requiring special education before we look at the question of provision for them. But there is more than one school for maladjusted children. I draw the attention of hon. Members to the 1966 Report of the Scottish Education Department, which has an extensive chapter on special education. At that time there were three grant-aided schools for maladjusted children and there was also residential provision by the Glasgow Education Authority. The situation is rather better than the hon. Gentleman stated it. In other places there is also day school provision. There are problems of definition, and there could
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0739">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>531</span>
also be differences of view in particular instances as to how best to provide for children who may be classified as maladjusted—whether they need residential accommodation, attachment to a special school class or special guidance and care in the normal community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
None of these problems is easy, but the provision is certainly improving and is much better than it was a few years ago. However, taking Scotland as a whole, we still have a long way to go before we can feel satisfied that we are making adequate provision for all the children in these various categories.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn from the children who are within the authority of the education authority to the children who may be reported to the local authority as a social work authority, as it will be under the Act. The number who are reported as unsuitable for either education or training has been running at an average of about 170 per year over the last few years. At present the local health authorities and the voluntary bodies between them provide places in day centres for about 330 children. That is not adequate provision by any standards, but it is no simple proposition to relate that figure to the figure which I gave earlier of the number of children who are reported annually.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To begin with, some of the children, unfortunately, go into hospital and at present are not provided for by the local health authority. Some of them are so badly handicapped that it is difficult to make any kind of provision for them outside hospital. In some cases one must take account of the wishes of parents who may not necessarily want the particular day centre which is provided by the local health authority. It is not simply a question of relating the two figures. But we can say that this is a field in which, under, I hope, the stimulus of the social work departments which will be established later this year, additional provision ought to be made. I hope that that will happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that I cannot make any kind of general pronouncement which would apply all over Scotland. The position varies from one education authority to another, and the way in which authorities meet the problems which they have at present varies not only according to their enthusiasm for meeting these problems and their willingness to meet
	<span class='label label-info column'>532</span>
them, but also according to the circumstances of their area. What may prove to be right and workable in scattered rural areas, for example, would not be right and workable in a bigger urban area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having made all these qualifications, I will sum up by saying that the position is not yet completely satisfactory but has certainly improved. I expect that the implementation of this Clause and the extended powers of ascertainment which are given to local education authorities will make the position rather better, and more quickly better, than is being achieved at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further point concerns special education for the under-fives. It is possible for education authorities, under existing powers, to provide nursery education for the under-fives. The extent to which that ought to be provided depends a good deal on the kind of child with which one is dealing, but if one takes the deaf child, or the partially deaf child, for example, and particularly the wholly deaf child, one recognises that it is important to get nursery education going as quickly as possible. In relation to the total number of deaf children a large proportion are catered for before the age of five—at the age of three and the age of four. That is an example of the authorities already, under present legislation, providing under-five special nursery education, and I expect that provision again to be improved by the new powers which we are giving to authorities under the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. Mr. Jennings, I do not know whether it has struck you, but it has struck me that the atmosphere in this Committee room is somewhat close. I wonder whether it would be within the bounds of order for hon. Members to strip down to the extent of taking off their coats, if they so wish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My mind goes back to last year, on another Committee. The straight answer is that it is perfectly in order, provided that it is kept within the bounds of decency. There are precedents. I have no objection to the hon. Member taking his jacket off.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Buchanan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order. I think you will remember, Mr. Jennings, that in the Committee to which you referred—which was
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0740">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>533</span>
the Committee on the Finance Bill—the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Bruce-Gardyne) made the same request and did exactly as he is doing now—that is, stripping off. He caught a whopping cold, and for the next fortnight he infected everbody with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Arising from those comments, I ask for your protection, Mr. Jennings, against what I can only regard as a somewhat infectious remark from the other side of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the hon. Member needs my protection, that will certainly be the day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that this is one of the important Clauses of the Bill. If we can get it right, as I think we have every intention of doing, then in the years ahead those unfortunate children who are affected by the Clause, and their parents, will have reason to thank us for our efforts here today, and earlier, of course, this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Clause is a new way of ascertaining the problem of handicapped children in the light of modern thinking. Here we are looking at the total condition of the child, the psychological, educational, and environmental position of the family as a whole, which is, of course, very closely tied in with the medical aspect of each child's situation. At the end of the day it has to be decided which is the best and most appropriate form of treatment for each individual child. This is where I think we ought to be asking ourselves questions in relation to this Clause, because there seem to be so many different streams and so many different forms of handicap that I wonder whether all those in a position to decide on the future of a child are aware of all the alternatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Presently we are working under the 1962 Act, and into this, of course, we are embodying Clause 11. We discussed that in detail this morning. But it certainly widens the duties of the local authorities and imposes on them stricter procedures for the assessment and the allocation of handicapped children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like briefly to consider the facilities which are available. In the more medical sense, the Minister is aware that in the last three Estimates debates, in 1966, 1967 and 1968 I raised questions about the hospital at Larbert and other
	<span class='label label-info column'>534</span>
facilities for mentally retarded children in the West of Scotland. There are so many classifications, and I, as a layman would find it hard to differentiate between each group, but perhaps the hon. Member for Glasgow, Kelvingrove (Dr. Miller) will break his silence and enlighten us on these classifications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have the mentally-retarded and psychiatrically sick children, for which there is a very good unit at Crichton Royal in Dumfries called Ladyfield, but that unit deals only with primary children. I am worried, in relation to this Clause, about the position of secondary school-aged children, the mentally disturbed adolescents—another word which I do not particularly like, but it is the one which is in common use. Perhaps the Minister might enlighten us on how he thinks that units for this type of secondary child are being developed in Scotland generally. We appreciate that we cannot have all the hospitals and all the units we want, but we should like to know his priorities and where these mentally disturbed adolescents are going in the near future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What facilities are available for these various classifications? How are we to co-ordinate the decision on these children in the social work department or the local education authority or by the Medical Officer for Health—or, again, with the help of the Scottish Society for Mentally Handicapped Children. There are a great number of people who want to do the best they can for the child but I am far from certain that the right answer has been reached, because so many people have a right to participate in this decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister gave me a full answer on Monday, to a Parliamentary Question dealing more specifically with education, on the number of places available in special schools. All of us will be glad to see that there are more places than there are children receiving such an education. I wonder whether at the same time I should have asked him the number of teachers available for the special schools. Perhaps then the picture might not be so rosy. The Minister might answer that when he speaks again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to know especially the position of the five to eight-year age group where it is difficult for a child, par-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0741">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>535</span>
ticularly a mentally retarded child, to go away long distances to school for the day. In my own constituency there is a first-class special school in Dumfries for children of five years and upwards. But a child may live 15 miles away in Annan. The school there is for children of eight years upwards. Therefore, from five to eight years of age, at perhaps the most difficult period for the child, the educational authority has difficulty in arranging transport for one or two children to be taken into Dumfries for special education. The hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) said something along these lines this morning in relation to dentists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This may, in fact, operate in reverse in the rural areas of Scotland. Great distances may be involved for the really young child, who needs his parents' help at night and who at such an age cannot be residential. It is difficult for such a child to travel long distances to special schools. Does the Minister feel that these schools are spaced geographically in the right places throughout Scotland? I know that this is a difficult problem, and I know, too, that local authorities are doing their best to overcome the difficulties. But the problem is there, and it has to be solved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to points which have been put to me by the teaching profession. All of us pay tribute to those teachers who have decided that their calling is to help mentally retarded children. It is a worthy calling. Those who have chosen it are particularly entitled to good working conditions. We want good schools for these children—schools which are good for the children and good for the staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope—and I am sure that the Minister will confirm—that classes of mentally retarded children are very much smaller than normal. These children are unique in many regards. Some of them may have very high I.Qs. although they may be retarded in other respects. Are teachers available to take those more advanced pupils forward, if the opportunity arises for them to progress?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main purpose of the debate on this Clause is to show the interest of all Members of this Committee in this particular form of illness and to indicate our
	<span class='label label-info column'>536</span>
determination to support the Government in every measure they may take to help these children in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make a short contribution to this debate. Of course I want to help my hon. Friend to get this Bill, but most of the remarks should not come from one side of the Committee. Many of my hon. Friends know of my interest in this matter over many years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) said that this is an opportunity for Members of the Committee to show their interest. I take his point, and I cannot refrain from adding something which may not be accepted on the other side of the Committee only since 1964 have we had any movement in respect of this vital service, which for too long did not receive the consideration which it deserved. I recall asking Questions about reports for the early ascertainment of the category of child about which the hon. Member for Galloway (Mr. Brewis) asked—the maladjusted child. It is true that some of our Questions and proddings resulted in a Committee being set up by the previous Administration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to congratulate the Department, because the evidence in the Annual Report, to which my hon. Friend referred, is there for all to see. However, I ask the Department not to halt their well-doing. In other fields connected with young people, I recall asking for remand centres and assessment centres in another type of delinquency. At one time, Scotland had none of these centres.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the category of maladjusted children, which is so difficult for assessors to define. There are different interpretations even by officers of different local authorities. I am not sure whether my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary dealt with this point, but there is a need for a more uniform assessment of the intelligence quotient for mentally handicapped categories. The Brotherston Report, issued by the Scottish Home and Health Department, states on page 24:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is obviously important that the assessment of children for handicap should be based on uniform standards throughout the country, and ways of doing this are recommended in reports by Working Parties set up by the Scottish Education Department."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0742">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>537</span>
As my hon. Friend has not referred to this yet, could we hear from him on this matter? The Report goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is not compulsory at present in Scotland, as it is in England and Wales, for school medical officers "—</p></blockquote>
and this is on another point—
	<br><blockquote><p>"to have a special course of training in the psychological and physical aspects of mental handicap."</p></blockquote>
That appears to be a gap.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that my hon. Friend will say that—and I think it is generally true—provisions for these children in Scotland are in advance of those prevailing in England and Wales. That is recommended in the Report. It goes on to suggest that medical officers should be asked to take a short course in respect of psychiatry and similar treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the maladjusted child we have one of the most complex problems, involving the assessment of interacting factors, for example, from the point of view of teachers. I originally started to inquire into this in 1963 after the receipt of letters from teachers who were making statements on the situation. I should be relieved to hear that the position has been improved. Teachers were saying, for example, that 17 pupils in classes for mentally handicapped children at this school in Lanarkshire had I.Qs. between 74 and 89. Some of those children, even with such I.Qs., had some behavioural traits which could be called maladjusted. Because of the lack of specialisation, a unit for such categories should be provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Teachers generally, and others who have been thinking about these matters, take the view that, as far as it is humanly possible, even this type of child should be admitted to the ordinary school. Where do they go? There is not a special unit for them. These children were being put into classes for the mentally handicapped. But children of an I.Q. of 89, with behavioural traits, were upsetting the behaviour and the conduct of those classes. That has been obviated to some extent, but I think it is worthwhile drawing further attention to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take it that part of the answer from the Department to the hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) will be, "It is all right in cities where there are sufficient numbers, as it were, of afflicted persons. It is then much easier to bring them in,
	<span class='label label-info column'>538</span>
and to justify public expenditure in providing that unit. But what do the S.E.D. do in sparsely populated areas where there may be only one or two of these people?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One would think that the solution was to have accommodation on a cooperative basis, as between local authorities. I can understand that some local authorities may want to do this and that some may not. Probably the answer is in the forthcoming Royal Commission Report on Local Government which would provide the opportunity, through extended local government boundaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return briefly to the point discussed earlier in new Section 63(2), in which we were concerned with an Amendment about local authorities' powers for those under five years of age and the distinction made for children over five years of age. It seemed to me clear that we were concerned not only with ascertainment and information for those over five. But, after early ascertainment for those under five, what were we to do? It seemed to me at that stage that the Bill was not clear. Are the provisions linked with provisions of Clause 3. Particularly in regard to deaf children, for whom there is most hope—and the Bill does not seem to provide for this—what is to be the treatment?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I leave it there, except to emphasise the point about the staff and teachers. I think that the figure is about 700, but what about recruitment? Tribute has already been paid to these dedicated, affectionate people who devote their lives to this work. The recruitment of such teachers is broad in age, and it could be that in a few years time, with retirements, the problem will be aggravated. I hope that I have not offended anyone, but knowing my hon. Friend's anxiety, I hope that he will understand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brewis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be very brief, as the last two speakers referred to several points which I hoped to mention. I take the point made by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Hannan) about maladjusted children being put into classes for the mentally handicapped. It is also true that maladjusted children in classes with normal children can throw out those classes. Therefore, it is very pertinent to ask that further provision
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0743">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>539</span>
be made for special classes or schools for this category of child, which, I believe it has been assessed, amounts to 5 per cent. of the children entering Scottish schools. The figure is certainly a great deal higher than was previously assumed—that is, the number of children suffering from some sort of maladjustment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to ask the Minister, what is the present position about I.Q. tests? They seem to be getting less and less fashionable. But I believe that the mentally handicapped are divided into those who are from 55 to 70, who are educable; from 40 to 55, who are trainable; and under 40, who are classed as un-trainable. But what one should be dealing with is the ability of these children to participate in real life activities, and what expectation they have of leading an independent life when they grow up. I wonder whether the I.Q. test should still be given as much prominence as it has been given in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to the teachers, I think that all points on this subject have probably been made, but I believe that about 50 per cent. of the teachers are over 50 years of age and that 75 per cent. are over 40 years of age so that the question of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill about recruitment is very apposite.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last subject I mention is that of the deaf. The deaf children are graded into three grades. Grade I can benefit from normal school instruction. Grade IIA children are given special places in the class; they can be at the front of the class or in some position from which they can hear better. Grade IIB deaf children need some special treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There remains the question of the Grade III deaf, whom I would describe in layman's language as being stone deaf from birth. The point which we have to remember is that these children may have normal intelligence outside of their deafness. What we must aim at is educating such children who have physical handicaps. An educated cripple—an educated deaf person, for example—can get on quite well in grown-up life. If he is not educated, he will be a liability on society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There seems to be no course for training the teachers of the deaf in Scotland. Should there not be some provision made
	<span class='label label-info column'>540</span>
at Jordanhill, Moray House for such a course? Secondly, a deaf child tends to fall further and further behind in his education through lack of language ability. I believe that there is virtually no means in Scotland of giving secondary education to what are described as the stone deaf. Is any unit being established at Donaldson School for the Deaf in Edinburgh for giving secondary education to what I believe are described as the Grade III deaf?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro), I suffer with the great problem of mentally handicapped children in a remote area. One sees the terrible difficulties not only of the parents but of directors of education in providing facilities for the education of children who come from a long distance. These facilities should include small occupation centres. I feel that this is a great lack at the moment in the scattered rural areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Small</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the principles of the Clause. The debate has illustrated the worry felt by parents. I do not think that, initially, the Clause will make great headway when it is put before the local authorities. Local authorities in Scotland always have an allocation of funds to provide the best educational facilities for the best pupils. I have had some experience of this matter. I have been in the Crichton Royal, the Donaldson School for the Deaf, and the Royal School for the Blind in Edinburgh and have seen many facilities, including those at the Bridge of Weir. I have done my best to meet the problems of the handicapped child.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past there was nothing to prevent an education authority or medical officer of health from employing a psychiatrist. In fact, in Ayrshire, Dr. Angus, who is a practising psychiatrist, was with Ayr County Council for four years when I was chairman of the relevant committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a rule, members of education authorities are parents and are approachable locally. That is what local democracy is all about. Appeals are always made for the unfortunate child who is handicapped, and there is always pressure to assist him. But whenever one approaches the committee to find a place for him, one has to fight against
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0744">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>541</span>
many other aspects of an education authority's requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Generally, I welcome the Clause and I hope that its implementation will lead to greater help than in the past being given to the unfortunate people in the community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the opportunity to discuss this matter. There are few pieces of legislation which come before us which give us the opportunity not only of expressing our compassionate view towards unfortunate people but also of taking practical steps to do something about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one difficulty which I do not think has been touched on very extensively so far, which I believe needs looking into, and it may well be that the Minister can tell me that this situation is covered by the Bill. It seems to me that one of the difficulties in dealing with handicapped children is that one gets a very wide range and different forms of handicapping—it may be a mental handicap, or a physical handicap—but one does know, from experience, that some children who are physically handicapped have exceptionally well-advanced I.Q.s. Because of this, within a group of children of the same age, a much greater range of I.Q. is found than would be found amongst unhandicapped children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure whether this problem can be catered for under these provisions, but it must create a demand for the right kind of teachers to cope with such a wide range within a comparatively small age group. If the Minister can give me some assurance that this matter is being borne in mind I shall be that much happier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Esmond Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to reinforce what has been said on both sides of this Committee, and put one question to the Minister. I endorse what has been said by my colleagues about areas like Galloway and Dumfries, which suffer far more acutely than does Edinburgh or Glasgow. I do not think the educational problems of Glasgow and Edinburgh, acute as they are, are as serious in this respect as they are in the more remote areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share the point of view of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Hannan) that this is a very individual
	<span class='label label-info column'>542</span>
problem, and that if we talk about categories we are apt to forget the individual. The emphasis on deafness brings out the fact that one disability is often the root cause of other disabilities. That is why it is important to begin educating children before the age of five.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept what the Minister said in his reply earlier this afternoon of the importance of the Social Work Act and the light it can throw on this. I do not quarrel with him when he confesses that we have a long way to go with accommodation. But his answer to my question about the supply of teachers was a shade Utopian. I appreciate that in the education of abnormal or subnormal children there is great value in having teachers who have had some experience with normal children. This is unquestionable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures cited by my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) and myself are very disturbing. I suggest to the Minister that not enough recruitment is taking place among teachers in the training colleges, and I suggest that there is considerable potential interest in this matter. I would qualify the point made by the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill, about this being a post-October, 1964 development. Many of these reports are dated from 1945 to 1951. This interest in the maladjusted, mentally and physically handicapped children has risen during the last 20 or 25 years. But the point remains that we ought to enlist the interest of teachers in psychiatry and psychology. They are growing subjects these days, and I believe that we could recruit people of 24 and 25 years of age into the schools to remedy the age disparity which, in 10 to 15 years' time—unless we take action now—will be a very serious problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that the Minister skated over the exciting aspect of this Bill, which is that we are going to begin educating children before they reach the age of five. This is where the real breakthrough can take place, particularly with deaf children. Why is there such a magic about the age of eight in respect of maladjusted, physically or mentally handicapped children? There are too many instances of the parents of children of that age being told that no more can be done for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must start to use the facilities of the Social Work (Scotland) Act in terms of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0745">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>543</span>
the relationship between medical officers of health and general practitioners. If we are to discover what is taking place in families before children go to school at the age of five only the general practitioner can help us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had the honour of serving on the Birsay Committee, which examined general practice in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland. This problem was hitting us very sharply the farther we went away from Glasgow or, indeed, Inverness. I suggest—and this is where the Social Work (Scotland) Act might be helpful—that there should be far closer relations between medical officers of health and general practitioners in the more remote areas, where general practitioners should be doing a lot more of the work at present carried out by the medical officers of health. If we really want to help children we should do so at the point where they can appreciably be helped—at the very inception of the discovery that a child is in some way handicapped, perhaps at the age of 2 or 3. It is in this way that the general practitioner can be of most service. If the Minister has the opportunity I hope that he will consider this point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Many points have been raised, and the general attitude of hon. Members has been to welcome the Clause. I am glad that that is so, because we are here providing a better statutory framework for the work of the local education authority. It is because we attach this importance to early assessment that we have worded the Clause as we have. There is literally no age limit and no age bar to the process of ascertainment, although we must remember that in respect of children under the age of 5 parental consent is required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not a serious disqualification. In the vast majority of cases the parents themselves—naturally worried about the progress of their children—are only too willing to have the process of ascertainment, and the advice and support that that involves, started for their children. We are providing that it shall be a duty of the education authority to do this in the widest possible way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>544</span>
It is true that this is not the kind of subject in which we can make a dramatic overnight improvement. This is a process of improving provisions all the time. This represents an important step forward, but I should be misleading the Committee if I were to pretend that getting the statutory framework right, by itself, makes a really major contribution towards solving the problems that are involved in dealing with the children with whom we are here concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the reasons for the difficulty arises from the fact that in many of the categories requiring special educational treatment the total number of children in Scotland is very small. We must all be extremely grateful for that. But, the numbers being small, the educational problem—both for individual educational authorities and for Scotland as a whole—is considerably increased.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, more than 400 children are now classified as deaf throughout Scotland. Taking account of the fact that between 300 and 400 are classified as partially deaf, individual education authorities are facing formidable problems because of the small numbers involved, particularly if we want to maintain the home connection and allow the children to be educated as day pupils rather than residential pupils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of these problems are so great that it is virtually impossible for an education authority in one of the smaller counties to deal with them on its own. The numbers are not there. When we are dealing with mental handicaps—and this is by far the largest category, of course—the numbers even in the smaller areas are sometimes sufficient at least to enable a special class to be run at an ordinary school, if not for a special school itself to be established. But even there, one has the problem which the hon. Member for Dumfries raised about travel, and whether one should persevere with day school accommodation or provide residential accommodation. I do not think that I can make any genera] statement about that, except that which I have already made, that we should all like to see the maximum number of children being educated in circumstances which allow them to stay at home. Education authorities in the more sparsely populated areas have that very
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0746">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>545</span>
much in mind in the kind of provision they make. Nevertheless, there may be cases in which residential accommodation is the only way of dealing with the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dumfries also raised the point which he has raised on a number of occasions previously about hospital provision for mentally defective children in the South-West of Scotland. This is not dealt with, strictly speaking, under this Clause, because we are here dealing with children receiving special education by an education authority at home, or else with children who are classified as suffering from a disability of such a nature or extent as to make them unsuitable for education or training either by ordinary or by special education. In these cases, of course, the children become the responsibility of the social work department, as it will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the children who have to go to hospital may be in the second category which I have mentioned, but they pose rather different problems of hospital accommodation. Either the disability is a very severe one, which makes it unmanageable in the domestic situation, or there may be, as often there are, associated physical disabilities which, again, make the situation unmanageable at home. That becomes, I think, a matter of hospital provision, which is not what we are dealing with in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman knows, I think, the position in the South-West of Scotland, if only because I have written on that on several occasions recently, at his request. I admit, and I admitted in letters to him, that the position in Southwest Scotland is not satisfactory at present, but, as he will know, the Western Regional Hospital Board has plans for improving the situation in the years to come, as part of its hospital development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Among the other points which were raised were those referring to teachers. I have said something about that already. I hope that what I said earlier was not read as being complacent about this situation, because we are short of teachers and we are not getting an adequate number coming forward. That was said, if I may say so, very explicitly indeed in the Scottish Education Department Re-
	<span class='label label-info column'>546</span>
port for 1966, to which I referred, and which dealt with the whole problem of special education at some considerable length. This is a difficulty. There are courses available at Moray House and at Jordanhill, but we are by no means out of the wood yet in getting an adequate supply of teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I made points this morning about the age distribution which I think are valid, again provided that they are not taken as implying that I am by any means complacent about this position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Galloway (Mr. Brewis) raised a point about the training course for teachers of the deaf, which has until recently been available only at Manchester. I am glad to tell him that next session there will be a course of training for teachers of the deaf in Moray House in Edinburgh. That will fill a gap which we have had up to the present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member also raised with me another matter about the deaf, in connection with secondary education. I think that he had this wrong. Secondary education is provided at Donaldson's School for the Deaf, Edinburgh, and in the Glasgow School for the Deaf. What I think he had in mind was senior secondary education or, in the English term, grammar-school education for deaf children. The only place in which such education is available at present is at the Mary Hare Grammar School for the Deaf in England, which a small number of Scottish children attend, if the education authorities concerned feel that they can profit from a senior secondary type of education which is not available in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to see this type of education provided in Scotland, but it is a question of numbers. We do not yet feel that we have enough children capable of taking full senior secondary education to justify special provision in Scotland. I believe that there are children in the two schools I have mentioned who go to "O" grade at present, but I will check on that. It is a question of numbers, and, as I have said, we have to rely to some extent on the provision made by the Mary Hare Grammar School in England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having seen what can be done in special education for the deaf and for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0747">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>547</span>
the blind, I feel that on the whole our special schools make a magnificent effort to do the best they can for the children who attend them, whatever the disability from which they suffer. The results obtained in many of these schools are well beyond what our expectations would have been even five or ten, and certainly 15 or 20 years ago. The standards of attainment are improving all the time, largely because of the devoted work of the staff, to whom tribute has been paid and to whom I should like to add my own tribute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already made the point that we have not nearly enough accommodation for maladjusted children at present. There is provision on a residential basis for the maladjusted secondary-school child at Lendrickmuir School, a grant-aided school in Perthshire. This school provides education for both boys and girls at secondary level. A new school for maladjusted secondary-school children is to be built shortly near Kilmarnock by Dr. Barnardo's—again with grant aid from the Scottish education Department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mention of both these schools serves as a rather interesting illustration of the opportunities for voluntary effort in this field. In a way, it is a pity to have to say this, because it may imply some reflection upon education authorities, but in some ways, when one is dealing with small numbers of children, it is easier for a voluntary organisation to decide where to build a school and what to provide there than it is for half-a-dozen education authorities to get together and to decide amongst themselves where the school ought to be, the basis upon which children should be admitted, and the financial arrangements. It is, however, a very interesting example of the way in which a voluntary organisation can make this provision on a grant-aided basis, with support from the education authorities who send children to the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Hannan) was one of several hon. Members who raised the problem of the under-fives. Nursery education can be provided, and I very much support that for under-fives who are ascertained as requiring special education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>548</span>
Perhaps I could give the figures for deaf children, at least, who are attending special schools under the age of five, and if they are related to the 400 or so, which is the total deaf population, I think hon. Gentlemen will see that deaf education for the under-fives is the standard, not just at which we aim, but which we virtually obtain everywhere. There are 40 deaf children aged four attending special schools; there are 24 aged three; and there are five aged two or under. It is possible to make provision, and we want to encourage authorities to make provision as soon as they possibly can, as soon as it can possibly be of benefit to deaf children, particularly, where much can be done at these early ages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But we must also face the fact that there are some other kinds of handicap where it is very difficult indeed to make provision under the age of five. Again, there is nothing in the Bill to prevent an education authority from doing it; in fact, it is the very opposite, for we want to encourage them to do it as much as we can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.0 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will conclude by dealing with the point about the tests for mentally handicapped children in the process of ascertainment. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill mentioned—if I heard his references correctly—a report which he called the Brotherston Report. It was a recent Departmental Report on the school health service, rather than on the education of mentally handicapped children. As I recollect it, that Report was sent to authorities only about 23rd January of this year, so that it is a little early for us to get responses to it. It covered, of course, many things apart from dealing with matters affecting mentally affected children. It dealt with a much wider field than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would rather draw my hon. Friend's attention to the Report of the Working Party on Degrees of Mental Handicap, dated 1961, which is the Report which laid down the guidance for education authorities in determining the level of ability, as it were, for the purposes of ascertainment where mental handicap is concerned. It is rather a lengthy Report, and it would be wrong for me to read from it at length. I simply say to my hon. Friend that no test of intelligence should
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0748">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>549</span>
be taken as the determining factor whether a child is to be considered mentally handicapped and requiring special education; or so mentally handicapped that, rather than a special school, it is education in an occupation centre that is required; or again, so severely mentally handicapped, that he must become the responsibility of the local health authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The testing which is indicated in this Report is meant as helping the process of assessment, but it is very important indeed, in making any assessment for these purposes, particularly mental handicap, where there is mental retardation, that all the circumstances of the child should be taken into account, including, of course—and this is very important—the home situation as well as the school situation. When one looks at the home situation in some instances, and when one sees some of the disabilities under which a child may be operating in his home situation, one's attitude to the child may be considerably changed. While tests are helpful in the ascertainment process, they must not be taken as the determining factor, because that could do a good deal of injustice to particular children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But this Report is a far too complicated and subtle document for me, as a layman, to interpret at any length to the Committee. All that I want to say to my hon. Friend and to other hon. Gentlemen who have raised these points is that all the points which they have raised are very much in our minds and are very much in the minds, too, of local education authorities. A good deal still requires to be done, but we have made a lot of progress in recent years, and what we are providing here, under this Clause, is the framework within which that progress can be continued, and, I hope very much indeed, accelerated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged, Mr. Jennings. May I raise two points on this Clause without recapping all the ground which was gone over this morning about the words "power" and "duty"? First, I should like to ask the Minister at which point the decision was taken to insert this phraseology in Clause 12, because, as he appreciates, it alters Section 67 of the 1962 Act by changing the word "duty" to "power". This may be desirable in the light of the new attitude towards the inspectorate, and indeed of the inspectorate towards their own duties. It is quite clear that not only in Scotland but throughout the whole United Kingdom H.M.I.s are changing from being, as it were, inquisitors, into being guides, philosophers, friends, curriculum advisers—whatever words one cares to use which removes the note of examination from the school situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to quote two problems. First, when the Select Committee on Education and Science visited Edinburgh—perhaps I should emphasise that that Select Committee did visit Edinburgh last year—it spent two days talking to officials of this Department, and this specific question was put to the Secretary of the Scottish Education Department, Mr. Norman Graham, on 29th May:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Do I understand"</p></blockquote>
—asked Mr. Gilbert Longdon—
	<br><blockquote><p>"that you are anticipating that Section 67 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1962, which imposes a statutory duty upon you to cause these inspections to be made, will be revised?'</p></blockquote>
Mr. Norman Graham replied, "No".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not very long afterwards comes this major step of a change of wording which is a total change of function. Why and at what point was the change made? It was plainly made only recently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I raise the second and much broader question on which no doubt a number of hon. Members may well want to speak? That is the whole question of the wisdom of accepting and converting into law this change in the character of the Inspectorate. I accept that H.M.I.s have increasingly become guides in the school, and that they are increasingly involved with the subject of their study,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0749">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>551</span>
often in working party reports. A great many of them—some people might think too many—are seconded to other groups than actual teams of inspection, and many of them are becoming specialists. It could be argued—and perhaps the Minister will want to argue this—that they can do more service in the school by going on an 	<i>ad hoc</i> basis as individuals, talking to other individuals, than in joining in a great team and taking over the school for a week or ten days, causing all the difficulties that this has occasioned in the past. If that is the Minister's view, may I suggest to him that there is a grave danger.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The danger seems to me to be reducible to three points. First, if one says "power" and not "duty", is there not the risk when the Secretary of State sends a team to look into a particular school, the situation becomes very specialised and peculiar at that point? If there is a five-yearly visitation, the school anticipates it and knows that it is coming. If suddenly, for some special reason, a whole galaxy of talent walks into the school, that will occasion trouble in the school which the normal five-yearly visit, awkward though that might seem, will not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, if the function of the H.M.I.s is increasingly to be specialists, working in a particular subject and talking to subject teachers rather than in the classroom, what about the old function of inspection, as such? Is there not still a place for the old-fashioned, quinquennial visitation by a team? No doubt the Minister will reply that it is difficult, because of shortage of staff and the rest, to guarantee a five-yearly rota. But even if there has to be a ten-yearly rota there is still a great deal to be said for the ultimate sanction—the duty of inspection—and not the slight degree of permissiveness that creeps in with the use of the word "power".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a third reason for some alarm at this change, namely, the growth, alongside H.M.I.s, of local authority officials with varying titles but rarely titles suggesting that they are inspectors. I know that there is some doubt in the profession about the use of the term "inspector", as being slightly Germanic, and dated. Local authorities do not have inspectors. Larger authorities have local authority
	<span class='label label-info column'>552</span>
advisers, especially in Glasgow and Edinburgh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister is saying that no duty of inspection is laid on H.M.I.s, how does he see the relationship between the H.M.I.—now increasingly an adviser and a subject specialist—and the local authority adviser, who has no duty in the same degree, and no real sanction to inspect in the old-fashioned way, or in the way that one is now apt to think is old-fashioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am really probing here. I should like to know at what point this major decision was taken. It must have been fairly recently. I suggest to the Minister that there is still value in the old-fashioned phraseology—if that is the way to describe it—of the 1962 Act, in other words, retaining "duty" rather than "power".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I hope that the Minister will be able to satisfy me. Most of my constituents would rather the present system remained. It is a long-stop. It lays a duty upon the Secretary of State and provides a check on schools. My constituents would be reluctant to lose this safeguard, and I agree with them. Unless the Minister is extremely convincing I shall vote against the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want first to deal with a small, uncontroversial point. The phrase "educational establishment" is defined in Section 145 of the 1962 Act. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Scotstoun (Mr. Small) is thoroughly familiar with that Act, and will remember the definition. Since he is so familiar with the Act, perhaps I need not read it, because it is a rather
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0750">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>553</span>
lengthy one. The phrase is defined there, and it covers establishments apart from schools, including further education colleges, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am astounded that there should be any suggestion that we should not make this change and I am particularly astounded that it should come from the hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Wright), who is a member of the Select Committee on Education and Science. It was an explicit recommendation of that Select Committee that in England and Wales the duty should be converted into a power. In the case of Scotland it was implicit throughout the Report—which the hon. Member presumably agreed—that a similar change should be made in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Member were to ask me when we took a decision to make the change I should probably not be able to put an exact date on it, but I can tell him that we were very much influenced by the excellent Report of the Select Committee on Education and Science, of which he is a member.

Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) on this matter? Did he go into the question of the great agitation in Edinburgh, South?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find it very difficult to remember what was going on in Edinburgh, South. I was once a constituent of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>554</span>
I do not suppose that he will consider that any particular honour or privilege, but I was, and I know that there was no particular agitation in Edinburgh, South at that time on this point—or, indeed, any other point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Clause does not make any change in practice; it simply brings the Bill into line with what is happening now. It provides that it shall be the duty of the Secretary of State to cause inspection to be made at such intervals as appear to him to be appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The former five-year inspection of individual schools does not happen now. It is no longer part of our inspection system. That does not mean that where special circumstances make it desirable to have a full scale inspection an inspection will not take place. It does take place. The change that we are making will not alter the procedure in the slightest. Where we consider that a full-scale inspection is required we can carry it out under the Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The former provisions catered for the old arrangements for inspection—the idea that there should be an inspection of every school at appropriate intervals, and that everything should be considered at that time. That is completely out of keeping with the present relationship between the inspectorate and local education authorities, headmasters and individual teachers, which is now a much closer and less formal one than it used to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other words, the job of the inspectorate is to keep in touch with what is happening in the schools in their area on a day-to-day basis, and to provide assistance and guidance where necessary, or to make representations as the situation demands. That is the present relationship. This relationship is not only very much welcomed by the inspectors but is very agreeable to directors of education, headmasters, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be quite useful for the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South and any other hon. Member who is concerned to read the evidence of directors of education, and so on, to their Select Committee about the question of relationship, to see how much the system is welcomed by all those who are actively concerned in education in Scotland, as compared with the old, rather forbidding relationship which sometimes existed between
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0751">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>555</span>
the inspector of schools and the classroom teacher, or even the headmaster, and which is now very much out-dated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Clause is welcomed by education authorities, directors of education and teachers' organisations. It seems worth making this change, particularly as I can assure the hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Wright) that his fear that there may never be a formal inspection, even where required, is unfounded. There is nothing in the Clause to prevent it, and it will happen if occasion demands in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clark Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the whole, the Minister's reply was a lot of waffle.

	<div class='title'>POWER OF SECRETARY OF STATE TO MAKE GRANTS TO EDUCATION AUTHORITIES AND OTHERS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman will give us some explanation for the introduction of a Clause to replace Section 75 of the parent Act. The general layout and presentation of the Clause is very different from that of Section 75. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will comment on that and about any changes of responsibility for providing funds that the Clause might present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an important Clause. While it replaces Section 75 of the parent Act, it provides the means whereby the Secretary of State can, in future, pay out of moneys provided by Parliament sums allocated for a variety of purposes. These purposes are all-important. They include the payment of grants to education authorities, to universities and so on. The one heading to which I should like to direct my comments is the payment of grants to education authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>556</span>
	<p>schools, not just a duty to be carried out as and when it is felt in St. Andrew's House to be necessary. I am not satisfied with the reply. There is a point of principle here. I do not mind if some iron discipline is put into the schools by the Inspectorate. I urge a Division.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman sounded as though he supported what his hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) called the jackboot of Fascism.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I congratulate the Minister on a speech in which he took notice of the unanimous Report from the Select Committee? I hope that this will provide a precedent in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 8, Noes 7.</p>
	<p>We have already had a full debate on Clause 1 about the proposal to abolish fee-paying in local authority schools. At that time, and later in the debate on Clause 1 as a whole, as during Second Reading, my right hon. and hon. Friends and I asked repeatedly what were the Government's intentions regarding the other independent or semi-independent sections of the Scottish education system. We suggested that the assault on the fee-paying schools in Clause 1 was simply the beginning of a major attack on the grant-aided schools and the independent schools.</p>
	<p>I assume that I am right in believing that the grants payable in respect of grant-aided schools would be paid under the authority of the Clause. If so, it must be relevant to ask one or two questions, as briefly as I can, about the Government's intentions toward grant-aided schools. We are here being invited to authorise the Secretary of State to make grants to education authorities. Part of those grants will be towards the maintenance of grant-aided schools.</p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0752">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>557</span>
	<p>I will not elaborate now—although there may be an occasion later on—the rôle which the grant-aided schools play in Scottish education. Theirs is an honourable and an important rôle. I believe that events over the last months have shown that the Government, through back-door methods, are trying to weaken the position of grant-aided schools in Scottish education.</p>
	<p>Every time that my hon. Friends and I have referred to the erosion of freedom in education and the assault on grant-aided and independent schools, hon. Gentlemen opposite have cheered. They have shown by their thoughtless cries that they wish to cut out freedom of choice in education in Scotland. They have shown that they want to crush, not only the fee-paying corporation schools, but the grant-aided schools and the independent schools. This, I believe, would be nothing short of a tragedy for education. I hope that this is the moment when the hon. Gentleman can rise to his feet and assure the Committee—and, through us, the people of Scotland and the parents of the pupils of these schools—that it is not the Government's intention, declared, semi-declared or obscure, to assault grant-aided schools any further.</p>
	<p>It is appropriate to raise this question now because there is shortly be laid before the House a Statutory Instrument setting out the new scale of grants for all the grant-aided schools. I submit that it is relevant to raise this now because, I assume, these grants will be paid by authority of Section 75 in the 1962 Act, or under the authority of the Clause.</p>
	<p>Whatever the Government say about their intentions towards education, whatever they claim in terms of increased expenditure, the truth of their intentions is revealed in the Statutory Instrument which I have in draft in front of me. Here we see the cuts that they propose in the level of grant for grant-aided schools. Here we see the threat which they represent to parents, and the children attending these schools which play such a critical rôle in Scottish education.</p>
	<p>There are about 19,000 children at these grant-aided schools, and 29 of them all over Scotland. I have looked at the cut in the grants for these schools which is to be made in the coming year. The Government propose to cut nearly £100,000—</p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>558</span>
	<p>5.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. These are draft regulations. When they become final regulations they will be debated in the House of Commons. I find it very difficult to understand how it can be in order to debate them under this Clause, unless we are, for example, to be allowed similarly to debate the U.G.C. grants to universities and all the other grants to educational research, and so on, all of which, one way or another, might be taken as being covered by this Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Jennings. The hon. Gentleman is mistaken, as he so often is. This Clause does not cover U.G.C. grants. It simply provides for the benefit of grants to universities, which are other forms of financing the universities which the Minister must comprehend. We would not attempt to raise the question of the University Grants Committee. To do so would be totally out of order. I submit that what is totally in order, if you rule accordingly, is the question of the grants payable to grant-aided schools for which the authority rests exclusively in this Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order. Is it in order to anticipate a debate that is likely to take place on this order on the Floor of the House?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order. We are considering whether to give to the Government powers to do something. We want to know whether they intend to continue to do it. If the Government are trying to do away with, abolish, or blow-up all our grant-aided schools, what is the point of having legislative provision for them to give grants? I think that it is absolutely in order for my hon. Friend to say that before we give the Government these powers we want to know whether they will need them, or use them. This is all we say. We cannot possibly agree to this legislation until we know whether the Government will use the powers, will allow a miserable continued existence to the grant-aided schools, or want to eliminate them altogether.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not lost sight of the fact that while the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) was talking, particularly
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0753">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>559</span>
when he raised the question of the Statutory Instrument, the question of point of order and relevance might be raised. While he was speaking, I carefully considered my reply. I direct the attention of hon. Members to the title of this Clause:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Power of Secretary of State to make grants to education authorities and others".</p></blockquote>
"Others" is a very wide term. It would take in the whole implication of direct grant schools. Secondly, I direct the attention of the Committee to new Clause 75, paragraph (	<i>d</i>):
	<br><blockquote><p>"… payment of grants to any other persons providing education or educational services".</p></blockquote>
The hon. Gentleman's general theme was therefore absolutely valid and in order. Where the doubt arises is in the use of the details from the Statutory Instrument. I rule that it is perfectly in order to mention the details, without arguing the merits or demerits of such details, in order to use them as an illustration. But there must be no debate, as such, on the Statutory Instrument. The answer to the point raised by the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) is that it would be out of order to anticipate a debate. Within those confines, the hon. Gentleman is in perfect order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to you, Mr. Jennings. As you will appreciate, I never abuse the rules of order. It was not my intention to debate the Statutory Instrument. That opportunity will present itself, and we shall take that opportunity as soon as the regulations are laid. We will then debate them in exhaustive detail, and try to force the Government to change their minds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All I say is that the draft regulations, which I do not propose to develop in detail at all, because that would be discourteous, provide that the grant to these grant-aided schools should be reduced by nearly £100,000. I do not propose to say more than that, but it is reasonable to mention just it. That is an indication of what the Government have in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not surprised that the Minister should have talked inaccurately about the University Grants Committee, and so on, because it is in his interests to suppress us when we try to raise this sort of point. It is in the interest of hon.
	<span class='label label-info column'>560</span>
Gentlemen opposite not to let the people of Scotland know what is happening to the grant-aided schools. We shall not allow the Government's gagging tactics to suppress the truth. It is right that people outside should know what the Government propose. If the level of reduction proposed takes place, the grant-aided schools will be squeezed out of existence in not so many years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh, no.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman says "Oh, no". Let him do the sums. I cannot develop the point in detail. We shall do so on another occasion. But he will see that that is the fact. The cut is substantial, and there is no justification for it whatsoever.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before we give the Government authority to proceed with Clause 75, before we give them authority to pay a grant, we must know much more than we do at the moment about the Government's intentions—how the grants under paragraph (	<i>a</i>) are to be paid, and for what purposes. In what other directions are they to be cut?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not even under paragraph (	<i>a</i>): they are under (	<i>c</i>).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are under paragraph (	<i>c</i>). I am much obliged. They come under the payment of grants to the managers of educational establishments. What are the Government's intentions regarding payment of grants under (	<i>c</i>)? What is to happen to the grant-aided schools? How far is the squeeze to be applied to them, and what is the justification for any squeeze at all at a time when, quite rightly, expenditure on education is rising? Surely the first thing we should do in our economic system is to defend spending on education. This must be the greatest priority of all in our investment. Why should the grant-aided schools within that pattern of investment be squeezed?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know the answer already. It is that the Government, in their hatred of selectivity of any kind, propose to squeeze these schools out of existence, not so much to kill the schools themselves as to force on Scotland one universal system of education with no choice for anyone. That is the threat which hangs over us, and I hope the hon. Gentleman will be able to dispel that threat this afternoon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0754">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>561</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend's plea for grant-aided schools, particularly as it affects two schools in my own constituency. I accept that we cannot go into details on this Statutory Instrument, but I would remind the Minister that it comes into operation on 1st April. If he does not get around to laying it very soon, there will be no time to deal with it on the Floor of the House. As so often happens with Scottish legislation, the time to pray usually ends up during the Summer Recess. We want to have it as soon as possible to deal with the grant-aided schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will take the point that we on this side, feel that the grant-aided schools have a very valuable part to play in education in Scotland. These two important Roman Catholic schools, St. Joseph's College in Dumfries, and the Benedictine Convent school, play a valuable part in the education of both boys and girls in Dumfriesshire. It is important to have a reply from the Under-Secretary indicating that these cuts will not take place. As my hon. Friend has said, we can all see the writing on the wall, and we know that it is the Under-Secretary's intention to squeeze them out of existence. That would be intolerable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope and I am confident that the Under-Secretary will not give any such assurance to hon. Members opposite. Why on earth we should given them any long-term assurance of that kind is beyond me, for them to ask for it is an impertinence. For one thing, we have still to debate the Statutory Instrument in the near future, before we know exactly what is to be approved by the House of Commons. For hon. Members to anticipate all that as part of their argument is within order, in general terms, but highly irregular, in many ways. To ask the Under-Secretary to give any sort of firm assurance that there would be no cuts is, of course, absolute nonsense. No Minister can give that assurance in the light of the debate that is coming along in the House in a few days' time—certainly within the next week or two.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been over all this subject already. I do not think there is scope here for any debate of any reasonable length. We have been over the principle in respect
	<span class='label label-info column'>562</span>
of fee-paying, and the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) knows it perfectly well—this is why he did not blow his top completely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We did not go over this precise point. During the debate on fee-paying, as the hon. Gentleman will remember, I asked the Under-Secretary repeatedly for some declaration of the Government's intent towards the grant-aided schools. Because we had no answer to our question, we seek an answer this afternoon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is now saying that, in a different debate which was not on this theme, he asked the Under-Secretary for the same assurances for which he is now asking on this point. There is not much sense in that, is there? He is now asking for something which he obviously cannot get in relation to what is embodied in the Statutory Instrument. That debate is what will decide the cuts proposed in the Statutory Instrument. Only that debate can decide that and only after that can we know the extent of cuts, once the Instrument is approved, if it is approved. So this discussion is hypothetical to that extent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To ask the Under-Secretary for a long-term assurance that we will never embody—if that is the word—the grant-aided schools within the general system of education in Scotland is also asking a lot. The hon. Gentleman knows perfectly well that the parties are sharply divided on this issue. Ultimately, this is an issue of fundamental principle, and it is only a question of time, obviously till it is settled. I should think that nobody on this side of the Committee would deny that he finds highly objectionable the principle of the parents of ordinary children—which is what it comes to, taxpayers in general—subsidising the special claims and demands by a certain minority of the public for special treatment in the education of their children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the hon. Member is well aware that children in these schools are educated at less cost to the public purse than those who are educated completely under the State system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We must get back to debating the Question, "That the Clause stand part of the Bill."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0755">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>563</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is reduced to mere simple arithmetic at this stage. If the hon. Gentleman is talking only in terms of pounds, shillings and pence, and simple arithmetic, per capita in education, we could have a good debate, but not at this moment, on that subject. But a far more fundamental principle underlies all this. The hon. Gentleman is perfectly well aware that special treatment for a few is being asked for and given, and is being largely paid for by the public. That is the principle at stake.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not merely a matter of quality of education. Hon. Gentlemen opposite can pretend that the concern is about education; in fact, it is concern with a special brand of education; special treatment in education; special education establishments, able to provide those special facilities and that special treatment. It is about staking a claim in future life for the people who get that special treatment at the expense of the ordinary consumer of education who does not enjoy these privileges. Hon. Gentlemen opposite know perfectly well that that is the basic aim of people who send their children from the far ends of the country to the State grant-aided schools. That is largely the reason for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, these schools have a high reputation. Nobody denies that they are good schools. But our purpose is to raise the general level of education throughout the country. We are not concerned with retaining a small number of schools permanently upon a privileged basis at the expense of the taxpayer, and at the expense of parents and children who have no access to them, but by whom a considerable contribution still has to be paid for others. Not everyone can pay that contribution. Yet those who can afford to pay their part of the costs can make a special claim upon the State and upon the ordinary taxpayer who can not. If the hon. Gentleman sees any justice in that, I certainly do not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a growing demand in Scotland for getting rid of the whole idea of this special and privileged form of education. If people are prepared to pay the total cost themselves, that is a matter for them; but they are not. The hon. Gentleman must remember that people in general are tired of paying year after year
	<span class='label label-info column'>564</span>
from the public purse for a small number of selective schools of this kind, for the purpose of giving a small number of individuals all the privileges in their later lives which they are enjoying in the State-aided schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will not give any such undertaking as is asked for by the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire. Nobody has any right to ask for such an undertaking, and to the public in large to give it would be an injustice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am slightly surprised that this debate should take place on this Clause, since it includes under paragraph (	<i>c</i>) power for the payment of grants to the managers of educational establishments, which is presumably what hon. Members opposite want. If we had left that out, I might have understood some of the indignation, although even at that I do not know that I would have understood the indignation of the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur). In fact, the power to pay grants to grant-aided schools is continued under the Clause, along with a number of other provisions. The Clause is basically a re-drafting and simplification of Section 75 of the 1962 Act. We have tried to lay out the provision in a rather more intelligible and up-to-date form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall be able to debate grant-aid schools when we come to the regulations. I for one shall be absolutely delighted to have a debate in the House about grant-aided schools. Hon. Members opposite are always making passionate speeches about grant-aided schools, and when the covering letter with the present regulations went out the other day, one or two of them immediately put a Motion on the Order Paper to complain. They said that no one had told them this was coming along.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of my hon. Friends pointed out that the announcement had originally been made on 30th January, 1968. Far from this being produced as a surprise, the grant-aided schools had been told about it in a circular from the Scottish Education Department on 6th February, 1968. It had apparently taken hon. Members opposite, who profess this tremendous interest in the grant-aided schools,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0756">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>565</span>
about a year to discover what was to happen under these regulations. There is nothing surprising about the regulations which were anticipated long ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I say, I should be delighted to debate them in the House. The main reason for the reductions is simple. When we were making other cuts in public expenditure, in accordance with the announcement by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister on 17th January, 1968, it seemed appropriate to us—and I am surprised that it should not have seemed appropriate to hon. Gentlemen opposite, too—that when public expenditure was being cut, a share of the cut should rest with the grant-aided schools in Scotland. That seems a reasonable proposition. The cuts were modest, particularly the cut made in the past year, or even the cut which is now agitating hon. Members opposite so much.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When is the hon. Gentleman to lay the regulations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member might take account of the fact that we have draft regulations as well as final regulations under the present procedure. It will all be done in good time; he need not worry about that. If he is desperate to make a passionate speech about grant-aided schools, I am only too happy to afford him facilities for so doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to our general policy for grant-aided schools, I have not the slightest intention of stating that today. Apart from anything else, the question of grant-aided schools has recently been referred to a special Scottish sub-committee of the Public Schools Commission. When we have its recommendations then, of course, we shall consider them and the Government will no doubt be making a pronouncement in due course—but certainly not now and certainly not before we get the Report of the Public Schools Commission. We can look forward to debating that when the occasion arises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All that we are doing in this Clause is providing for the continuation of the payment of these grants. Hon. Gentlemen opposite want to dispute that proposition and say that they will not allow the Government to have this Clause till we tell them rather more, or care to put down an Amendment on Report to take out paragraph (	<i>c</i>). I will certainly consider that, but at the moment I think
	<span class='label label-info column'>566</span>
that we ought to continue this provision. Therefore, I assume that we shall get the support of hon. Gentlemen opposite for the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very disappointed indeed with the Minister's reply. I suggest that he is treating the whole of this large problem far too lightly. I appreciate, of course, that the question of grant-aided schools is before the sub-committee of the Public Schools Commission at this moment, but this is no reason why the Minister should not state, honestly and frankly, what the Government's attitude toward grant-aided schools is. Why will he make no pronouncement whatsoever on this point?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must add to that that one has become used to this sort of evasiveness from the Government: "We cannot give any expression of view about such and such because a committee is looking into that matter now"; "We cannot make any comment about the financial future of so and so because we have already indicated our intention of cutting the grant for that purpose." We have heard exactly the same sort of argument today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had the warning that the grants were to be cut. We have had them frozen. Now we have had them cut, and cut substantially. Why should they, out of the whole of education, be singled out for a cut?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They have not been cut.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that they have not been singled out, but they have been singled out. They are being cut very substantially, indeed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a piece of nonsense, because another part of the announcement on economy which was made a year ago referred to the raising of the school-leaving age, which principally affects the public sector of education and which was a very substantial cut, indeed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that point, and I believe that the hon. Gentleman is being very firm, very firm, indeed, because one of the tragedies of the announcements last year was the postponement of the raising of the school-leaving age through the Government's economic bungling. The fact, however, is that the school-leaving age had not already been raised; this was the postponement of a desir-

able objective, What is happening here is that something which is already in being is being tampered with and weakened by the Government, and that is, the structure of the grant-aided schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not in this Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman may say, "Not in this Clause", and, technically, he is quite right. It is not being weakened by this Clause, but this Clause provides us with the opportunity to question the Government about these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regret very much that the hon. Gentleman has not given us any answer. Because he has not given us any answer I believe that my hon. Friends will want to join me in dividing against this Clause. If its defeat embarrases the Government, they must find a way out of their embarrassment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to say anything after the splendid and absolutely outstanding words which have been said in such a brief and objective way by my hon. Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur), and I also hesitate to speak at all on this matter when I have been out for a few minutes. What I was doing was getting hold of the regulations, which we are not allowed to mention, but I thought that it would be just as well to have them with me in case other hon. Members might slip through the net of order and refer to them briefly. The reason why I was able to go away was that, although we have had a great deal of courtesy and consideration on many occasions from the Minister, I knew that on a subject like this, which is concerned with ideology, we should probably have a flippant and irrelevant reply. From what I hear, this is certainly—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] Quite honestly, Mr. Jennings, with the mood of the Committee as it is, we should make better progress if I sat down. But I thought it was a shocking reply. My hon. Friend demolished the arguments entirely. If the Minister would briefly reply, we could have a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to my hon. Friend's defence against the attacks of hon. Gentlemen opposite. They are getting all excited about nothing at all, because in response to an interjection
	<span class='label label-info column'>568</span>
made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis), the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) said that my right hon. Friend was quite right technically. I cannot understand why there is all this excitement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of us on this side of the Committee consider that the distasteful decision which the Government had to make about the postponement of raising the school-leaving age was one of the more disastrous decisions, in spite of the overall priorities which the Government had to decide. Some of us think that that decision has been carried out at the expense of some desirable objectives. But we cannot have an important provision like this criticised in this fashion without some response from Government supporters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was just emphasising the fact that this is a very important Clause and that we need to discuss it very thoroughly. My hon. Friend appreciates that it is very important that the public in Scotland should know that the Tories are rigidly against any expenditure on education in Scotland. It is important that we stress that, so that the people of Scotland know what this is all about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend will remember my analogy that the Opposition are like the irate football supporter who, when the ball was lost, said, "Never mind the so-and-so ball, let's get on with the game!" They are asking us to take decisions in advance of the evidence which the Committee will produce. We ought to await the report to which my hon. Friend referred before we proceed further in this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>MR. MACARTHUR 	<i>rose in his place, and claimed to move,</i> That the Question be now put, 	<i>but</i> The CHAIRMAN 	<i>withheld his assent, and declined then to put that Question.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Jennings, may I call your attention to the difficulty with which we are faced? We have been summoned here this afternoon at the Minister's request in order to make progress with the Bill. My hon. Friends and I wish to make progress by having a Division now. Hon. Gentlemen opposite are filibustering and delaying the proceedings of the Committee quite artificially
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0758">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>569</span>
because they are unable to get enough of their hon. Friends to attend the Committee to muster a majority. I hope that even if procedurally it is not possible to have a Division now, people outside will notice the way in which the Committee is being treated by the Government, and the way in which time is being wasted. I warn the Minister that if he goes on in this way he cannot expect any help or support from us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.0 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having listened to that outburst, might I remind the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur), first, that this is only the third time that I have spoken in 12 sittings. One could hardly call that filibustering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a very interesting Clause. We are discussing whether we should replace one set of words by another set of words. That is all we are discussing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it is only a matter of replacing one set of words by another, and there is nothing in it, there is no need to make a filibustering speech about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So much nonsense has been talked on the other side of the Committee, and it has been talked with such spurious emotion, that one has to reply to some of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that my right hon. Friend is wrong. I know that he does not wish to mislead the Committee. But is he not minimising the effect of the Amendment and the attitude of the Opposition? Supposing they carried it to a vote—and won. The totality of provision, not only for education in all these various forms—grant-aided schools, education by local authorities—but also for the universities and all the rest would be completely wiped out. Surely that is much more serious.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend. What we are discussing is whether the power of the Secretary of State to make grants to education authorities and others shall be expressed in one Way or in another way. That is what we are discussing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Gentlemen opposite have got so excited about this that they have decided to vote against the Clause. What will be the effect of that? Against what do
	<span class='label label-info column'>570</span>
hon. Gentlemen intend to vote? What situation do they want to create in Scotland? They wish to create a situation in which the Secretary of State will not be able to pay grants to education authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alex Eadie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend is on to a very good point. I have a Question down for the Secretary of State for Scotland. I am seeking to find out whether in the next six years pupils are to have an increase in their bursaries. Is my right hon. Friend arguing that that comes under this Clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eadie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does that mean that for the next six years pupils in my constituency are not to have any increase in their bursaries?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We have to bring a sense of perspective back into the debate. Instead of going into all these little details—I prevented the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) from dealing in details—we must keep to general principles. This Clause deals with the power of the Secretary of State. Allied' with that power is the question of the payment of grants. In discussing power it is very difficult not to debate the question of payments, and that is where the Committee—and the Chairman—have run into difficulties. I therefore ask the Committee to try to get back to a sense of perspective on the general principles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eadie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. I suggest that, with all due respect, it is not a very trivial matter when we are discussing powers in relation to finance.

Gentlemen opposite are seeking to do: they are seeking to prevent the Secretary of State from making payments of grants to education authorities. That is most serious.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman is right in one sense and wrong in another. We have been forced to the point of voting against this Clause—as we will do when the Government are brave enough to face a Division, and that may not be today—because the Government have repeatedly refused to answer our question about their intentions regarding grant-aided schools. If we received a clear answer, we would withdraw our opposition. The right hon. Gentleman knows perfectly well that if we were to succeed, as we may, in the event of a Division, the Government would have no alternative but to reintroduce the power to make these grants at a later stage of the Bill. We do not want to remove this power. This is a demonstration by us, and it is the only opportunity we have to make it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is like saying that because a roof might leak in three months' time we will pull the house down now so that the tenant has nowhere in which to live. That is the argument the hon. Gentleman is putting forward. I have never heard anything quite so fantastic in my life. I have never heard a more stupid proposition put before this Committee. Never before have I heard such a proposition, which would deny money being spent by the Secretary of State on education. It is the biggest single item of expenditure in the whole of Scotland, and hon. Gentlemen are wanting to stop it. What is the next thing——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I call the hon. Gentleman's attention to a very important fact. It is that Mafeking has been relieved! He can now sit down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman really should not get so excited by thinking that he can have sprung a fast one on the Committee. We are much too old hands for this sort of question. The next thing that payment will be stopped for will be the payment of grants by the Secretary of State to universities, and payment of grants to the managers of educational establishments. If hon. Gentle-
	<span class='label label-info column'>572</span>
men were successful in their vote, the very grant-aided schools about which they are so concerned would not receive a penny and the parents of the pupils at grant-aided schools would be faced with the prospect of having the fees, which they are at present paying, doubled or trebled. Is this what the hon. Gentlemen want?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to save my hon. Friend from the danger of apoplexy. We would not want a by-election, would we, if we could get round this present situation? This proposal has been misread. It is simply that for Section 75 of the principal Act there shall be certain substitutions. If these were deleted, the principal Act would remain in force. I prefer, in all its tortuous phraseology, 75(2). I will not read it to the Minister, as I defy anyone to understand precisely what it means. Nevertheless, I prefer it to the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"… the payment of grants to universities".</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) is perfectly right in asking what the payment of grants to universities in relation to the whole of the United Kingdom set-up means.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having read the Clause again, I think that the hon. Gentleman is probably correct. I must point out however that——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Let us get some semblance of order about the Committee. It has become a perfect shambles. [An HON. MEMBER: "A filibuster."] Filibuster or not, that is my business. If it is a filibuster, I will tell the hon. Gentleman. The right hon. Gentleman is, at the moment, perfectly in order. Mr. Willis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Assuming that the hon. Gentleman is right, even if this Clause were defeated hon. Members opposite would not be doing anything more for the grant-aided schools. The pupils would be in just the same position as they are at present. The hon. Gentleman very cleverly got in a little propaganda about an order that is not yet before the House, but that has nothing to do with the Clause. And the questions the hon. Gentleman asked had nothing to do with the Clause. When a Committee has been set up to make recommendations to the

	<span class='label label-info column'>573</span>
Government, my hon. Friend is quite right in telling the hon. Gentleman that he will not say what the Government's intentions are. That is precisely what my hon. Friend said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend would be very foolish if he started to pontificate on what the Government's intentions were, when a Committee was sitting to consider precisely this point. One does not set up a Committee to consider something, and then announce its policy in the middle of the Committee's sittings. Committee members would just chuck their hands in if a Government acted in that way. The hon. Gentleman knows that quite well, but as he had not been on the soap box for two or three sittings I suppose he felt the attraction of once again letting himself go. So he got up, and let himself go.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The right hon. Gentleman should come to the question of the principle of the Clause. It is a lot of words, very attractive, very interesting, but let us get down to the meat of the thing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very grateful for your help, Mr. Jennings. I know that I am apt, at times, to wander a little bit, but I do not think I have wandered any more than hon. Gentlemen who spoke previously on this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would only say that I prefer the wording proposed in the new Clause, and my hon. Friend has served the Committee very well in the answer that he has given——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman says that he prefers the wording in this Clause to the wording in the original Act. What precisely does he prefer about the wording in this Clause to the wording in the original Act?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been asked to cut my remarks short, and I am anxious to get this Bill along. I am prepared to sit here until Saturday morning, but as not many other hon. Gentlemen are prepared to do that, I will cut my remarks short, if the hon. Gentleman does not mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I prefer these words to the others. I think my hon. Friend has answered the debate very well indeed. He is quite right in refusing to reply to the hon. Gentleman's request for information——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>574</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clark Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. Is it in order for the hon. Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) to be standing there like a dummy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I simply heard the latter part of the sentence and I did not catch the first part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clark Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Should he not be seated if he is not speaking?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a little disturbing for hon. Members to wander around the Committee room. I hope that they will desist.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I might be allowed to finish—I have hardly been allowed to utter more than two or three sentences without an interruption. My hon. Friend was quite right to refuse this invitation to speculate about what the Government's intentions might be in regard to the grant-aided schools at a time when a Committee is inquiring into the subject and will make recommendations. Obviously, this matter will need to receive some attention. I have my own views, but it would be out of order, Mr. Jennings, for me to say what they are. Nevertheless, I think that my hon. Friend was right, and I am quite sure that he will get this Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must admit that I do feel a little rebuked by the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis). Although he was, with his customary courtesy, reluctant to put his thoughts into, perhaps, language as tough as many other members of the Committee might have used, he has really been criticising, and rightly criticising, people like myself for not having made our contributions to this debate earlier on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had many things that I wished to say on this Clause, but I desisted for a considerable period earlier on because it was my desire to help the Minister in his somewhat erratic course towards the end of this Bill. I have put away my notes for a speech on the Clause purely in order to help the Minister get it through. I have been, as I thought, doing my best to help the Minister, and the right hon. Gentleman—and I must give the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East full credit for this—comes along and, in his charming way, rebukes me for having not put forward my views. I am afraid that that is the only way in which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0761">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>575</span>
I can interpret what he said. He started off by saying that he felt this was such an important Clause that it should be fully debated. I may be over-sensitive, but I took that to be a reflection on myself, which I feel was justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should give this matter very cautious scrutiny. The Minister has asked us to pass this Clause without giving the background necessary in passing important legislation in this Committee. He shrugs off our request that we should be told his views on the purpose of the payment of these grants, and the policy to be followed by the Government in helping such educational establishments as will receive these grants. What will be the Government's policy towards these establishments in the years ahead? If we are not passing legislation to decide that, what on earth are we passing legislation for?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has rebuked us—and he rebuked me, who had not made a speech at all—and has expected us to agree to the Clause with the cool excuse that he cannot be expected to tell us what the Clause is intended to achieve, because he has set up a committee which will eventually tell him what it thinks should be done. Even if the right hon. Gentleman's committee does produce some concrete suggestions about the way in which these schools should be run in future, we have no guarantee that the Minister will accept them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot rely upon this committee eventually to tell us what should be done about these schools, yet we are being asked to renew provisions allowing us to give Government money to schools, without knowing the Government's intentions towards them. We should resist this. Before coming here this afternoon I would have been surprised to hear that this was to be done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is the argument now deployed by the hon. Gentleman, why did his hon. Friend move the Closure to cut the discussion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a very good point. The hon. Gentleman asks why my hon. Friend moved the Closure. The answer is that my hon. Friend was following the policy which he has followed throughout our discussions—of trying
	<span class='label label-info column'>576</span>
to make progress. I very much hope that our discussions will finish by next Tuesday. Nobody can accuse me of having held up the Bill. I have held back from speaking time after time, purely in order to help. Yet the Closure has been moved by my hon. Friend——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Sufficient unto the day with regard to the Closure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Tuesday is my target for finishing the Bill, even if it is not the Minister's target. The Minister must tell us how these schools fit into the Government's educational plan. He owes this to us, to the parents who send their children to these schools, and to the staff who work in the schools, who want to know what their future is. We cannot expect them to toil on, term after term, year after year, with a vague threat hanging over them, knowing that whenever the incompetence of the Government demands a cut in education anywhere in the United Kingdom they are going to come down like a ton of bricks on these schools and reduce their grants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Every time the Minister effects a reduction in the grants of these schools he makes it more difficult for the less well-off parent to afford to send his child there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Again hon. Members are getting wide of the principle of the Clause and are now discussing details discussed on Clause 1.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should hate to do that. I would not dream of doing that, although I point out this Clause has nothing to do with fee-paying schools. It concerns what are known as grant-aided schools, and I think that what I am saying is perfectly relevant in that way, at any rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we have debated the subject here for a long time, I hope that the Under-Secretary will tell us, irrespective of the Public Schools Committee—and I hope that it produces a most interesting report—what is his view of the future rôle in the education system in Scotland of these schools. If he does, we can make progress towards next Tuesday, which must be the target for finishing the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must say something more in view of the speeches we have heard. Apart from my hon. Friend's
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0762">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>577</span>
excellent contribution, we have had a so-called speech from the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis), which was all too representative of the kind of contributions we have had from hon. Members opposite on what he agreed to be a most important Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under Secretary made only two points in reply and both, as I think he will agree on examination, fall to pieces. First, we asked him why he wanted these powers to continue and how he would operate them. He said that it was only fair that the grant-aided schools should bear their share of the reduction in spending. He must know that in almost every other item of education expenditure there have been substantial increases. With the effects of inflation, to reduce the grants will add enormously to the burdens of the grant-aided schools and make their task even more difficult. To that extent the Under-Secretary gave no answer. He did not take into account the enormous increase in costs which has taken place which, in view of the cuts, will make life intolerable. It is not too much to ask that we should have a clear indication from the Under-Secretary of how he is to operate the powers for which he asks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the lambs of our education system are to be carried to the slaughter. They are to be carried to the slaughter by the arrival of all the sheep in the Committee who have been drummed in to make sure the Government get their provisions through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will not have escaped you, Mr. Jennings, and I hope that you will remember this in our later deliberations, that we were about to reach a conclusion on the Clause with the issues absolutely clear. We had a disrespectful and disgraceful contribution which appeared to be a deliberate wasting of the Committee's time. As we are sitting tonight to make progress, I hope that you will remember the deliberate filibustering tactics which were an affront to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Filibustering is not unknown on either side of the Committee. When it is skilfully done, it is often within the bounds of order. Whether I recognised filibustering this afternoon, or last Tuesday, or on another occasion, is a matter for me. I observed certain trends, but they were within the rules of order and I could not interfere, either this afternoon or last Tuesday. It is not
	<span class='label label-info column'>578</span>
right to say that the Chairman is not aware of hon. Members wasting time. If they deliberately waste time, I shall tell them. It is not without the recollection of the Chair what are the tactics on either side of the Committee, and I take due note of these things in making decisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. Is it not remarkable, within your long experience of being Chairman, Mr. Jennings, that we have seen what appears to be an attempt by Government supporters to take a little time after the Government had introduced a Sittings Motion which compels us to be here for a long time? Is not this exceptional?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order. I have no control over the tactics employed by either side of the Committee, as long as those tactics remain within the rules of order. That is all that concerns me. The battle of tactics is a matter for other people. I will step in when needed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Small</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order. I know you are no innocent abroad, Mr. Jennings. You had to declare that there was a demonstration on the other side. So the matter of filibustering is, in my opinion, an aside. As a matter of fact, it was, as declared, a demonstration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I call Mr. Taylor again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we are considering the future of historic schools which have made a major contribution to Scottish education, for the Government to treat the whole thing as a joke and a farce is something which must be deplored.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have only been two arguments put against us. One of them was put by the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East. He said that if we make our demonstration for these schools, for their future, and for Scottish education, what we are doing is throwing out of the window the opportunity for the Government to make any contribution at all to schools, to universities, to the sixth-formers in Midlothian, and places like that. A simple reading of the Clause itself, not the Amendments, would have pointed out, as my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Wright) so appropriately did when he intervened,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0763">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>579</span>
to the hon. Member for Edinburgh, East that in fact this was simply replacing one form of words with another. When we find a Member making a long speech on a matter like this without apparently reading the first two words of that Clause, we see how weak the Government are in opposing the splendid sentiments which were put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second argument was that they can take their share of the cuts. When we see the massive, intolerable, enormous burdens which are being put on these schools, with the specific design of rooting them out and making it financially impossible for them to carry on their educational tasks, I feel the time has come to protest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we succeed in defeating this Clause, we shall not save the grant-aided schools. We shall not necessarily make their financial position better, but we shall have made it crystal clear to the people of Scotland, and to the parents who have faith in the achievements of these schools, that we protest not only about the decision, but the scandalously irrelevant way in which the Government have treated deep-rooted and sincere views which have been put forward by Members on this side of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I need not add anything to the excellent speech of my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis), who dealt with the arguments admirably. I have already made the Government's views clear on the question of grant-aided schools. It would be improper for me to anticipate the report of the Public Schools Commission on this matter. It would be insulting to the Commission to ask it to look at this matter and then for the Government to produce a pronouncement about the future of these schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Clause provides for the continuation of the payment of grants to these schools, which is what I think all Members of this Committee, whatever their views on these schools, want to happen. I hope therefore that we might now get the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must tell the hon. Gentleman that nothing which has happened in the course of this debate
	<span class='label label-info column'>580</span>
will remove the concern I have about his previous reply. The right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis), for whose views I normally have such a healthy respect, said, and I could not fail to hear him, that if we were to vote against this Clause and were to win we should be removing the power by which these grants are paid. For a moment, I believed the words of the Privy Councillor, until my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Wright) quite rightly reminded me that we should not be doing any such thing, because the terms of Section 75 of the parent Act would remain. So by voting against this Clause and removing it we should not be removing the power to pay grants to these schools; we should not be removing the power to pay any grants to any form of local education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, I am surprised that the Minister has not yet troubled to explain to us why a change in wording is necessary at all. I asked him in my opening speech why he proposed to make this change. We have had no answer, but that does not surprise us. We go on asking questions and getting no answers during the discussions on this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred a little earlier to Mafeking, when the right hon. Gentleman was speaking. The reason was that we were comfortably in the majority at one time, because hon. Gentlemen opposite were not interested in this Clause. They were not interested in grant-aided schools. They had gone away about their other business. I noticed that as I spoke the message went out, Gath and Askalon were alerted, and in came the sheep to relieve the Government and produce faultless unthinking votes for them. That is the position we now confront. No doubt, the Government, with their majority, will steamroller this Clause through. Whether they do or whether they do not does not matter very much, because the right to pay these grants continues. We shall use our votes, Mr. Jennings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is now the time at which I promised I would suspend the Sitting. If I thought the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) was making a very brief speech in the next minute or two, then I should be in a position to put
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0764">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>581</span>
the suggestion. If that would be agreeable, we could take an hour-and-a-half from that moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If you allow me, not a minute or two, but perhaps two or three minutes, no longer than that, Mr. Jennings. It is my intention to sit down very shortly, but it is also my intention to make my point, and I am sure you will allow me to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman keeps saying that he cannot make any statement about grant-aided schools. I am not going to go over this again. I have said it before. It is quite inconceivable to me that the Government cannot let us know if they are in favour of grant-aided schools or are opposed to grant-aided schools. If they will not give an answer to that, we must believe, in terms of all that they have done and are doing, that they are determined to damage, weaken or remove grant-aided schools in Scottish education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is significant that in the latest issue of 	<i>Scotland,</i> the official publication of the Scottish Council, there should have appeared an article on Scottish education by an hon. Gentleman opposite, not a member of this Committee, the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Dewar). We know that the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South is always first in the field to support the Government. We know that when he made some references to grant-aided schools the other day he had the cheers of his hon. Friends. Therefore I assume that what he writes in the Scottish Council publication reflects the views of the Labour Party. I shall not bore the Committee by reading this at length, but there are one or two phrases which I believe are very important indeed.

	<br><blockquote><p>"A frontal attack may not be necessary … The first step is to force the grant-aided schools to choose where they stand … All financial concessions must be withdrawn …"</p></blockquote>
	<p>And later:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government should strip away the financial advantages. The grant-aided schools are an anomaly."</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>That is the theme of this article, and it appears in the official publication of the Scottish Council, which is read throughout the world. It must appear to many people, as it does to me, a backdoor expression of Government policy. It is tragic that this should occur just after the publication of another pamphlet by the Scottish Council, in which the attention of incoming industrialists was called to the grant-aided schools and the fee-paying schools, the variety of choice in Scottish education, and the great contribution which these schools make to the heritage of education in Scotland.</p>

I bow most cordially, Mr. Jennings, to your proposal that we should bring this debate to an end. I hope we can reach a decision now.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I move this Motion in order to ask the Minister what are his intentions for the rest of the evening. This morning we met for two-and-a-half hours, and this afternoon we met for another two-and-a-half hours at great inconvenience to hon. Members on both sides of the Committee, particularly, I suggest, to hon. Members on the Government side of the Committee. As hon. Members will have observed, the Government found it very hard to maintain a Quorum during the earlier part of our proceedings. Indeed, they found that they had to filibuster on the last Clause in order to whistle up some of their lost sheep.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly it was an embarrassment for the Government to meet this evening, and equally it will be of considerable inconvenience to hon. Members to stay here for much longer tonight. I propose to the Minister that we should meet until 9 p.m. at the latest. That would allow us to make substantial progress on the Bill. I suggest 9 p.m. because at that time the wind-up speeches will be starting in the House of Commons in the debate on the earnings-related social security scheme. It is important that hon. Members should be able to hear in those wind-up speeches, first what the Opposition has to say and, secondly, to hear the weak defence which the Government may wish to make for their proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be quite wrong if, because of filibustering by Government supporters, we were denied the opportunity to hear these debates. I must warn the Minister that if he wishes to retain the good will of this side of the Committee, which we have offered to him throughout, he would be wise to agree that we should adjourn at about 9 p.m. which will allow</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>ABOLITION OF HIGHLAND SCHOOLS GRANT, AND COMPENSATION THEREFOR</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think we need spend long on this Clause, but it requires some explanation from the Minister. As I understand it, the purpose of the Clause is to remove the power which is provided in Section 77 of the parent Act for the payment of certain annual sums, paid half-yearly, to certain local education authorities in the Highland counties, and indeed to some which are outwith the Highland counties but in Highland territory. The sums of money are fairly small in relation to the total expenditure on education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may, within the Rules of Order, briefly refer to Schedule 1, Mr. Jennings, we see there that eight education areas are involved and that a sum by way of compensation is to be paid for these areas in place of the annual grant. The total sum is £12,586, and I believe this represents about 14 times the annual payment. I imagine that some actuarial computation has been made and I assume that the Department has had discussions with the local education authorities involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had a word with my own local authority about the £868 to be paid to Perth. I understand that they have no objection at all to this claim. I have not been in touch with the other education authorities, but it is only fair to say that I have received no representations from them. Nevertheless it is a change of some substance and I hope the hon. Gentleman will explain it and let us know why this change is being made, and tell us, too, what consultations there have been with the local authorities involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>8.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been the subject of consultation with the authorities concerned and they do not object to what we are proposing to do. It is unnecessary for me to go back over the history of this grant, but it goes back to 1837 and was originally used to endow teachers' salaries in schools erected in the Highlands and Islands where the parishes had been divided for ecclesiastical purposes. As a modern provision it
	<span class='label label-info column'>586</span>
is obviously no longer relevant, and the amount of annual grants, which at the moment for all the authorities concerned comes to £899, is trivial in relation to the total expenditure on education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However these have been additional payments to the ordinary rates for grant payment and therefore we do not think it right to abolish them without providing compensation. Compensation is provided for, as outlined in Schedule 1 of the Bill, to the extent of 14 years' purchase. This removes an outdated provision and has the agreement of all the authorities concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I was about to point out that if that had not been done, in fact Amendment No. 59 has no effect at all. I thought that we might dispose of that very quickly, if I were allowed to explain why it was so. Then we could
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0767">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>587</span>
have a debate, which I know hon. Gentlemen want to have, on the substantive point when we read the later Amendment to Clause 24. If that is agreeable to you, Mr. Jennings, and if the hon. Gentleman will accept my word on it, I think he will see that what I am suggesting will not deprive him of a debate. The debate can take place on the Amendment which concerns him, which is to Clause 24.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point in my mind is one of consultation. If the hon. Gentleman realises that—I am sure he does—I am willing to accept his assurance and to handle the Amendment in the way which he suggests, if that is agreeable to you Mr. Jennings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. In other words we take Amendment No. 59 almost formally.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. The explanation is simple but I have a very unsimple collection of papers in front of me. If he wishes to make a regulation under the Acts, the Secretary of State has to observe procedure laid down under Section 144(2) of the 1962 Act which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… the Secretary of State shall, not less than forty days before making regulations under this Act, cause a draft of the regulations to be published and sent … to every education authority, and shall have regard to any representations made by an education authority or by any person interested before he makes the regulations."</p></blockquote>
Later in the Bill it is proposed that, among other changes to Section 144, subsection (2) should be removed. The purpose of our two later Amendments is to preserve subsection (2). Our purpose in preserving subsection (2) is to make the debate on the main Amendment possible and sensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the main Amendment, No. 59, is simply to ask the Minister what proposals he has for consulting these institutions regarding any regulations which he may wish to make. In Clause 16 there is a substitution of a new Section 81 for Section 81 in the 1962 Act. There is no provision, as I view it, in that Clause for consultation with the institutions concerned. As the hon. Gentleman will know, there has been a substantial number of representations to hon. Members from institutions and colleges from all parts of Scotland, calling attention to their hope that a consultation
	<span class='label label-info column'>588</span>
procedure will be introduced, so that regulations are not made without their knowledge and without their having any opportunity to discuss the content of the proposed regulations with the Secretary of State. By retaining Section 144(2), it seems to me that we should provide a general protection for the rights of consultation in matters of this kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously, it would be possible to extend this argument at length. I think I have made the main point, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be able to respond to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had accurately interpreted what the Opposition's intention was in this matter. The reason why I did not think it would be sensible to have a long debate on Amendment No. 59 is simply that, even if the Amendment were passed, it would make absolutely no difference to the Clause, because all regulations under this Bill, as under the previous Act, will be subject to the provisions of Section 144 of the principal Act. That applies to all regulations, and, therefore, putting these words in makes no difference. They are completely redundant. They would not alter the effect of the Clause at all. It seems to me that what the hon. Gentleman is after is really an appropriate Amendment, perhaps a probing Amendment, to Clause 24 of the Bill, and we can discuss that when we come to it, but I do say to him that Amendment No. 59 is a misconceived Amendment, although I understand the intention behind it because it would not make any dfference at all, even if we carried it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So the question of consultation with the institutions which are covered in Clause 16 would not be improved, one way or another, by this Amendment. I do assure him, therefore, that this is misconceived.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the point about consultation, I would be perfectly happy to answer that in debate on the Question, That the Clause stand part of the Bill, and he really must raise the matter either then or, if he wishes, on Clause 24, and not here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are taking with this Amendment the two later Amendments, Nos. 57 and 58, one of which relates to Clause 24. I am sure that Minister is right, but I hope he will
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0768">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>589</span>
explain to me a little more why he is right, because the effect of Clause 24 and the Schedule to which the last Amendment relates is to delete Section 144(2) but it is that subsection (2) which provides the consultation procedure which we wish to preserve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we are to take the three Amendments together, I am perfectly happy. I was, perhaps over-generously, simply putting the hon. Gentleman on the right track as to the best way in which to argue the case that he obviously wishes to argue. If we are to take them together, I shall be perfectly happy to answer the points about Clause 24 now, but obviously, if I do that and we discuss them now, we cannot discuss them later. I should like to put myself in your hands, Mr. Jennings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the Under-Secretary knows the point we wish to discuss. The purpose of suggesting this Amendment referring to Section 144 was simply to call the Committee's attention to the terms of that Section. I do not mind a button if we discuss it now, or under Clause 24, or under the Schedule, provided that it is discussed. It seems reasonable to discuss it now in a grouping of three Amendments to save time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I take it that he agrees to withdraw Amendment No. 59, and to rely on Amendment No. 57.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly. If our later Amendment were to be successful, Section 144(2) would remain in the parent Act. The purpose of the first Amendment was simply to call attention to the importance of Section 144. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 30, in page 22, line 44, leave out from 'Regulations' to end of line and insert:

The purpose of the Amendment is to enable the Secretary of State to make regulations under the new Section applying to one grant-aided college, or to a number of such colleges, as well as to all of them together. It may be necessary to do this, and the wording of the Clause at present is not quite broad enough to cover that kind of situation. For example, it may be sensible at some time to have a set of regulations which deal with, say, domestic science colleges, or with colleges of education. The Amendment would enable this to be done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of these Amendments is to limit the definition of a grant-aided college to a college of education, a central institution, or a new college established under the powers given by new Section 81(2) set out in the Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first Amendment contains a substantial point. The second is simply a consequential drafting Amendment. Having reconsidered the drafting of the Clause, we concluded that the present definition of "grant-aided college" is too wide. It provides for including
	<br><blockquote><p>"any institution … for the provision of any form of further education"</p></blockquote>
That would cover a wide range of institutions, and it might well include clubs and centres for social and recreational activities which are subject to grant from the Government. Obviously, this is not what we are dealing with under the Clause. We have moved the Amendment to limit the definition to the kind of institution which we have in mind and to exclude the others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does this new definition mean that an institution like the Edinburgh College of Domestic Science would be included?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it would be included, because it is a Central Institution. That is the kind of institution we are trying to define, but we are excluding others which the wider definition would have brought in unintentionally, including many institutions which receive grants from the Secretary of State under entirely different provisions. It could be a club or a centre for social and recreational activities. Obviously, we do not want here to provide regulation-making power for the Secretary of State, including powers to set up such clubs and to dissolve them, but those powers are all included as the Clause is drafted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said earlier I am not happy about the Clause because
	<span class='label label-info column'>592</span>
it appears that there is a certain body of opinion which thinks that the Secretary of State is given considerable powers whereby he could abolish various institutions, or take extreme action, about them, without any need to consult them, or without giving them any right of appeal against his decisions. We need some means of protecting these institutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Under-Secretary assure me that my anxieties are without foundation because there is some later provision which gives the sort of safeguards required? Clause 20, for instance, provides a wide range of appeal machinery. I am not sure whether it would not be available to the sort of people I have in mind. If he can tell me that my fears are without foundation, that there is some safeguard for these people—and the Edinburgh College of Domestic Science is a case in point—I shall be happy to shut up. If he wishes to intervene now and tell me, I shall be even happier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A place like the Edinburgh College of Domestic Science enjoys a world-wide reputation, and it has greatly benefited from the fact that its type of governing body is drawn from a wide cross-section of society. This brings in some sort of little extra that is not found in every educational establishment. This is particularly important in an establishment which teaches people how to live. It is a form of art education. It teaches people how to live, how to run a family, and how to become good members of society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to have a wide-ranging group of people as governors. If the Secretary of State made use of the powers which he appears to have under the Clause completely to sweep away that structure, or change it, the effect could be very damaging. I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman could tell me whether I am talking through my hat.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Clause is a very wide extension of the provisions of the 1962 Act. The relevant Section in that Act was overwhelmingly preoccupied with teaching, with courses, with curricula, and with the content of education. The striking feature in Section 81(1)(	<i>a</i>) and (1)(	<i>b</i>) is to
	<br><blockquote><p>"make provision with regard to the constitution of the governing bodies of such colleges … prescribe the general functions to be discharged by the governing bodies"—</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0770">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>593</span>
and so on. Almost every one of the arguments on page 22 reinforces this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to hear the Minister's views about the future of central institutions, colleges of art and further education colleges, because we are at a turning point on that aspect of education. The Select Committee on Education and Science is looking into the subject, and the Minister will have to take account of this, as he does when he makes a reference to breaches of discipline. As outlined on page 22, he must
	<br><blockquote><p>"prescribe the procedure to be followed in cases of alleged breaches of discipline …"</p></blockquote>
This is very important in the present ferment of educational opinion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will go so far as to give us an assurance that in the regulations which are drawn up there will not only be some approach to genuine participation by the teaching staff in the running of the institutions but a code of discipline which is acceptable to the student bodies in these colleges. These are the most neglected people of all in the present educational development. It is there that the great ferment is likely to occur during the next two or three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have seen evidence of this in Bristol, in the relations between the students in the further education colleges and the university, and I am a little wary about our giving to the Secretary of State broad regulatory powers at a moment when the movement of opinion among junior staff and students is for participation in a process of self-government. I should like a reassurance from the Minister on this point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will answer the noble Lord the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North (Earl of Dalkeith) first. We are dealing not only with colleges of education, which are basically subject to this kind of provision already, but with the central institutions, which are not. These central institutions have been set up under private Acts of Parliament, endowment schemes, articles of association, and so on. The great majority of these are very old, and hardly meet the circumstances of 1969. There is probably no dispute about that. I think that the central institutions would accept the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>594</span>
Secondly, for their finance they depend virtually 100 per cent. on the Government at present. To all intents and purposes they are completely financed by the Government, and expenditure on the central institutions is now running at about £4·1 million a year for maintenance and £2·5 million a year for capital expenditure. This money is all being paid to institutions run by autonomous boards of governors set up under various old Acts of Parliament, and so on, and basically with no participation by the Secretary of State in the make-up of their boards of governors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only powers which the Secretary of State has over these colleges rests in the financial arrangements and in certain negative powers which are exercised in respect of courses, and so on. Basically, it is an out-of-date position. The Central Institutions themselves agree about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are here providing the framework within which the Secretary of State will be able to make regulations for the government of these colleges in the same way as for colleges of education at the present time. That does not mean that under the regulations the new boards of governors will have no authority or power. That is not the position, for colleges of education now have wide delegated powers. But it means that this is all being done under a structure of regulations. This is sensible as public money is involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Wright) raised an interesting point about staff participation. This is relevant, because none of the central institutions has a governing body which allows participation by the staff. This is simply an example of the way in which they are no longer up to date, whereas the colleges of education, which are governed by regulations, allow for staff participation on the boards of governors. This is the kind of thing that we shall be able to put right when we have the power given by the Clause. I think that will have the support of all hon. Members in the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same applies to student discipline. Regulations for colleges of education lay down certain principles for student discipline which are designed largely to protect the interests of the student who may
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0771">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>595</span>
be in disciplinary trouble with the principal of the college, or the boards of governors of the college. Again, we have no status in this matter with the Central Institutions. The only way to get some kind of statement of principles, at least, as distinct perhaps from a detailed code, which may be going rather too far, for the Central Institutions, which I think the hon. Member for Pollok wants, is by having this regulation-making power and including something in the regulations when we produce them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only other question is that of consultation. I want to give an assurance that we shall not act in a completely arbitrary way. The Secretary of State dealt with this point at some length on Second Reading. I can repeat the assurance that we shall consult and, in anticipation of the Bill going through, are now consulting the governing bodies of these institutions about what the regulations might contain. Obviously, we shall consult the existing governors, and when we make regulations in future, it will be after consulting the governors, as they may then be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I may also say that, while I have said that in many ways the governing bodies are not so representative as we should like them to be, it will certainly be our intention to have a large element of continuity between the existing and the new governing bodies, because we have no wish to see the government of these colleges upset, either in the short term or the long term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On all of these points I can give assurances that we are well aware of the views on these matters held by the existing governors. Having said that, I must also say that none of them seriously questions, or questions at all, the need to bring the government of these colleges up to date. That is what the Clause basically attempts to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"at the commencement of this Act".</p></blockquote>
Does his employment cease at the commencement of the operation of the Bill, or at the commencement of the Clause? The Amendments are intended simply to ensure that the meaning is clear, namely, the latter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brewis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Many of us have had a letter signed "Anxious parents" which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Education (Scotland) Bill proposes, in effect, that a teacher holding a responsible post must retire at 65 years of age whereas at present he may continue until he has taught for 45 years.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>This new proposal, if enacted, would lead to a sudden dramatic and disastrous reduction in the numbers of teachers (particularly well qualified teachers of mathematics and science in secondary schools) at a time when staffing is in a precarious position."</p></blockquote>
As that is not exactly how I understand the Clause, I should like the Minister to take the opportunity to say something about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not entirely happy about the Clause, and I hope that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0772">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>597</span>
the Minister will be able to reassure us. I do not like the idea of a fixed date and minute being uniformly applied throughout Scotland to the age of retirement of teachers. I recognise that the terms of subsection (1) leave a limited degree of discretion, but it can hardly be disputed that the main impact must be to make the Clause effectively mandatory on the teacher with the teaching responsibility allowance to retire at 65, and the other teacher to retire at 70. It has always seemed to me that in a matter of this kind there is much to be said for the maximum degree of discretion being left with the local authority, which must know the circumstances of the individual case and the individual employee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I belong to the age group which was brought up and educated during the war when, inevitably, one was very often taught by septuagenarians, if not by even older people—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] I had a suspicion that some hon. Gentlemen opposite might at this hour of the night, be provoked to some frivolous comment. The answer is that there are some septuagenarians—and this is precisely my point—who probably still make better teachers than others will ever make in the whole course of their teaching careers. But, equally obviously, there are probably many more who certainly should not be teaching at over 70. There are, perhaps, many more who should not be teaching at over 65, or even, conceivably, at over 60. One wants to have the maximum degree of discretion in the hands of the employers, who know the circumstances of the case. There is obviously the maximum degree of discretion with the individual teacher as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not entirely happy about this matter, and perhaps the Minister will be able to reassure me. It seems to me that if we pass this Clause as it stands, we shall be withdrawing all effective degrees of discretion and, quite apart from the valid point that my hon. Friend the Member for Galloway (Mr. Brewis) made, that there might be the danger of a substantial and sudden loss of teachers from the profession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Quite apart from that, it seems to me that there is the danger that we might either lose the services of teachers who are still able to do, and are still doing, a very good job. If we put a limit at 70, or a
	<span class='label label-info column'>598</span>
limit at 65, that limit tends to work both ways, I would submit. It not only means that we are very unlikely, notwithstanding the exceptional procedures in subsection (1), to be able to carry on teachers beyond this point, but also very unlikely that we will be able to encourage—let us put it no higher than that—teachers who really should retire earlier to do so. It becomes a fixed state, and it works in both directions. To my mind, this seems somewhat undesirable. I hope that the Minister may be able to reassure us on this point, but I do not quite like the impact of the Clause as it stands at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Small</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A small point, in the sense that we have now reached sex equality: under 17(1)(	<i>a</i>) the reference is to when "he attains the age" and the word "he" is repeated later. The only point I want to make is, does this apply to both sexes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think from what hon. Gentlemen have said already that it is clear that we are not entirely crystal clear about the meaning of the Act. There are three questions: First of all, as far as I can see, but I would like the Minister to confirm that, while there is a general obligation to retire from promoted posts at particular ages in the first group, this does not, in itself, involve any question of putting an obligation to retire. If this is the intention, it seems to me a thoroughly good thing because I think one of the difficulties of teaching, as a profession, is that promotion tends, for obvious reasons, to be very slow. If the promotion machinery were to be clogged up unreasonably by people staying on in the promoted posts above a certain age, then clearly this would be a very great disincentive to the younger teachers who were coming on. So I would like an assurance that, when it says that there is this general obligation to retire, it is related to promoted posts from 65 years of age and, of course, any posts from 70 years of age, as is later indicated. The second question is that of discretion. I think that, while the general point that I have made might be generally acceptable, we are all aware of cases in which, in outlying areas, we have people in so-called promoted posts, which might be those of headmasters, or in two-teacher or indeed one-teacher schools, and we know that responsibility payments are carried for those. I think it would be very
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0773">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>599</span>
unfortunate indeed if teachers who have integrated themselves into the community were obliged to retire. Many Members, like the hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan), must be aware of many places where someone who does under the Remuneration of Teachers Act, 1967, receive a responsibility payment in perhaps a single teacher school in one of these outlying schools, or the headmaster in a very small school. I think it would be wrong if the discretion which is provided in this, by saying "his employer otherwise determines" would not permit that as a general point to be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third question I would like to ask the Minister is whether it is wise to specify ages, as such, in an Act which may be law for a considerable period of time. Would it not be better to indicate it is his intention to lay down these two ages for these two purposes, but give himself the general right to vary these ages by regulation at a later date?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say this because I think it is clear to all of us that, as time goes on, people are becoming more and more able generally to carry jobs of responsibility at a much older age. I think many of us are aware that, as time goes on, we are finding that one of the greatest problems we have in our community is that of people who are forced to retire and find themselves with a great deal of time on their hands with a great deal of unused energy and resource by which they could make a contribution to society. Obviously, it would be wrong to use this to justify changing the age at this stage, but I think, bearing in mind the increasing health of the population, the much longer age that people are living to, and actively that there could well be a case for allowing for some change as time goes on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think all Members in this Committee will have the pleasure of going round some of the newer types of old-age pensioners' clubs—what we might call the jazzed-up old-age pensioners' clubs—not the kind which perhaps we had at one time, but the kind where one finds active people with plenty of brains and a great deal of energy. The message which comes from many of these clubs is that retirement ages, even at the present time, are quite out of touch with reality, and
	<span class='label label-info column'>600</span>
with what retirement ages were meant to be at one stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These questions need to be asked, because of the way this Clause has been drafted. I hope the Minister will reply to this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One brief point. I quite accept what my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) said about the opportunity for promotions, but I wonder whether we should not have written into this Bill something to the effect that a person should retire at the end of the term in which he attains the age of 65. Earlier on we discussed the disruption of school life when there were more than one or two school-leaving dates in a year. It seems even more important that we should not lose a teacher in a position of responsibility in the middle of a term. The point has been put to me by teachers, and it is a very genuine one, that if a teacher in a post of responsibility attains the age of 65 at the beginning of the summer holidays, towards the end of July, he would not receive the holiday pay applicable to that post of responsibility until the end of August, which all of us would agree would be his just due, because he had earned the holiday during the summer term. Perhaps the Minister could comment on this point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was very glad to hear the hon. Member for Glasgow, Scotstoun (Mr. Small) raise the question of "he" and "she". This is a matter which perturbs us from time to time. I imagine that, just as the singular embraces the plural in the Interpretation Act, so, in the words of my hon. Friend, who is much closer to students than I, he embraces she. Perhaps the Minister will confirm whether or not this is so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I confess that I am uncomfortable about this Clause, although I will not put it any higher than that. I always believe that there is something uncomfortable in requiring people in academic life to retire at a set age. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Wright) no doubt has very strong feelings on this. I have known some good teachers who were very old men. I have known some old men who were very bad teachers, and I do not think one can make a general rule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Age has perhaps some bearing, and particularly today, on the degree of kinship which a teacher feels towards his pupils. I remember the story of a provost at one of the old colleges in Oxford who year after year turned down a request by students for the installation of fixed baths in the college, replying each time, "Baths? Baths? What do the young gentlemen want with baths? They are only here for eight weeks at a time." This ran until the 1930s.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return now to the Clause, although I suggest that that was not entirely irrelevant. I am not sure that we should lay down as firm a ruling as this. As it stands, the Clause requires a teacher in a post of special responsibility to retire at the age of 65, and other teachers to retire at the age of 70. Everything depends on the two loopholes in the Clause, the two escape points. One of them, as the hon. Member for Glasgow, Spring-burn (Mr. Buchanan) reminded us with his Amendments, is that the Clause will only come into force on such a date as the Secretary of State may appoint. There is a certain discretion, resting with the Secretary of State. In determining that date, no doubt he will be guided by the number of children at school and the number of teachers available to local education authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tabled a Question for oral answer on Monday, asking how many teachers there are in posts of special responsibility over the age of 65, and how many others in posts not of special responsibility over the age of 70. However, we are making such good progress with the Bill that we have reached this Clause before I have had the answer to my Question. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman could indicate how many teachers will be lost if this Clause does not take effect now. I hope he will also tell us when he believes that the Clause might be brought into effect, in other words, at what sort of date will the Secretary of State introduce the Statutory Instrument provided for in subsection (4).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other loophole is even more important, and that is that in the first line of the Clause there is a discretion for the local education authority. My hon. Friend the Member for South Angus (Mr.
	<span class='label label-info column'>602</span>
Bruce-Gardyne) quite rightly called attention to the need for discretion in these matters. The Clause opens with the words,
	<br><blockquote><p>"Except where his employer otherwise determines"</p></blockquote>
whether a teacher shall retire at this age or that age. The employer in this case must be the local education authority. What extent of discretion will the local education authority have? For example, after the Clause takes effect, as a result of the Statutory Instrument under subsection (4), will a local education authority considering a teacher, in a post of special responsibility, and aged 69, who is a superb teacher whose services are essential for the quality of local education, be able to retain him or not? I hope the Under-Secretary will be able to tell us the extent of this discretion which is provided by this Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.0 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a further point which I hope the Under-Secretary will bear in mind. It is to think back for a moment to the circumstances in which teachers now approaching their retiring age started their teaching careers. Many of them became qualified teachers in the early 1930s when it was very difficult to get a teaching job. There are many teachers now who had to wait and to look around for one, two or three years before they could get a job, and they lost a number of years which would otherwise have counted towards their pension. If they are required to make up their 40 years, I think it is, to qualify for their full rate of pension, they will in some cases need to serve beyond the age of 65 in order to qualify fully. I believe that the Department's view is that some sort of concession has been made by allowing teachers in posts of special responsibility to carry on beyond the age of 65. I do not regard that as a concession at all. I think it is an act of natural justice on the one hand, and an act of proper regard for educational needs on the other.

I hope the Under-Secretary will be able to assure us that teachers who had these difficulties 35 and 40 years ago will not be penalised in any way by this Clause. I hope that he will also be able to assure us that no regulations will be introduced, if it is felt that the implementation of this Clause would lead to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0775">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>603</span>
a substantial drop in the number of teachers available to us. I hope also that he will be able to assure us that, in the end, the discretion will rest with the local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I start by taking up the point made by the hon. Member for Galloway (Mr. Brewis). He quoted from a note which, I think, most of us had from some anonymous source about the effect of the Clause. Of course, it does not represent accurately what the effect of the Clause is at all, for reasons which will become clear later. What we have here is a misunderstanding about the way in which the Clause is drafted, and I think, when one has cleared that up, as the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) has done, most of the fears about this Clause disappear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It does, of course, allow flexibility. It does not come into operation till the Secretary of State brings it into operation by order. I do not expect that that would be very long delayed, but the reason why we put this particular provision in was simply that we did not want it to come into operation perhaps in the middle of the term. This Bill may get the Royal Assent some time before the end of the summer term. I hope that it will.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might have been inconvenient then to have education authorities looking at all their more elderly teachers and determining whether to keep them on or to dispense with their services. That would be rather unreasonable. Since we could not fix a date for this, as one can never say in advance exactly when a Bill will acquire the Royal Assent, we thought that it was simpler to put in this provision and then bring it into operation by order, fairly soon after the passing of the Act, but in a way which would allow the authorities concerned to do it in a regular and organised way. That is the first element of flexibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second thing is that there is the qualifying phrase in both subsection (1) and subsection (2):
	<br><blockquote><p>"Except where his employer otherwise determines …"</p></blockquote>
That takes care of all the cases that have been mentioned. For example, in
	<span class='label label-info column'>604</span>
the case of the teacher who may become 65 or 70 in the middle of the term, in the middle of an examination period, and whom the authority might wish to retain for a short period to get over that particular difficulty, the authority will be able to do that by the flexibility that is written into the Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a matter of fact, since the employer's right to do this is not limited in terms, theoretically the employer can continue to exercise this discretion to a virtually unlimited extent. I do not expect that this will happen in practice. I do not wish it to happen in practice. What is intended here is to ask authorities to look at the individual positions of teachers at the age of 65, where they have posts of special responsibility, and at the age of 70 otherwise, and, as it were, make a conscious decision whether they do wish to retain them. There may be cases where it is very right that they should retain them, but that is done by conscious decision, not simply by allowing the position to continue without anyone doing anything about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This provision meets points that have been made about teachers' promotion prospects, and so on. Teachers have the right to some kind of assurance that promoted teachers, in particular, will not simply be allowed to carry on without any conscious decision having been made by the authority at all. Therefore, I expect that in the case of promoted posts, the normal retirement age will be 65. It will be the normal retirement age, for that matter, for non-promoted posts, but so far as they continue beyond 65, I would expect, again, that they would not normally continue beyond 70. That is how I expect it to work in practice, although it is theoretically unlimited in the terms in which the Clause is drawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that in practice he expected that 65 would be the normal retirement age for those in non-promoted posts as well. This is the point I want to take him up on. It comes back to what, in a sense, was the second leg of my argument; the reverse side of the coin. Precisely, if we lay down ages like 65 and 70, not only do those ages become to a large extent maxima, they also become minima. Would
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0776">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>605</span>
it not, under the terms of this Clause, be very difficult for a local authority to encourage the retirement of a teacher, in a post other than one of special responsibility, between the age of 65 and 70, even if he was really rather going over the top?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I made that comment about the age of retirement normally being 65 anyway, even for a teacher in a non-promoted post, I had very much more in mind the fact that the vast majority of teachers want to retire at 65. Now that the pension arrangements have run for sufficient time to produce in some cases the maximum pension, or something near the maximum pension, before the age of 65, one of our difficulties in years to come may very well be to keep all our teachers until age 65. This will certainly be so in the case of women teachers, who are affected by this Clause in exactly the same way as men. That is why I think that 65 will normally be the retiring age. But the Clause does allow flexibility, and does allow the authority to take account of the wishes of individual teachers, as well as taking account of its own teacher supply position. We are here making a kind of declaration about retirement without imposing such a strait-jacket on a local authority that it could not meet the circumstances of its particular case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not a completely new Clause, although it may appear to be so. Similar provisions were contained in the old superannuation regulations which formed the Third Schedule of the 1962 Act. They were supplanted by the provisions of the Teachers Superannuation (Scotland) Act, 1968. We are now replacing something that appeared, probably rather inappropriately, in superannuation regulations, and which was expressed in terms of superannuable service within certain age limits. This meets the wishes of the teachers' associations, which attach tremendous importance to the matter from a promotion point of view, and it is also acceptable to local authority associations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Section 84 of the 1962 Act gave the local education authorities the right to pay retiring allowances to any teachers. I expect that nearly all teachers are now in superannuation schemes. Will the hon. Gentleman give me the assurance that no one will suffer?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, Section 87 of the 1962 Act covered officers and servants who were not teachers. Again, may I have an assurance that they will be looked after.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brewis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Section 87 also deals with other officers and servants who are incapacitated by age or infirmity. Some of them might be infirm at quite a young age, and might not get a very good pension. The Minister seems to be taking away the power to give them a gratuity when this happens.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The superannuation provisions are, inevitably, extremely complicated, but I can give the assurances that both hon. Gentlemen require. I have looked at this point carefully, and I am assured absolutely that no one will be put at a disadvantage. We cannot think of any employee who could possibly be put at a disadvantage by the removal of these two Sections, which are now virtually obsolete. The employees concerned will either be covered by teachers' superannuation schemes or by local government schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a case should arise which was not covered by either of these two schemes it would be possible to make extra-statutory provision for the individuals concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not necessary to retain these two obsolete Clauses, and I am not aware that any of the interests we have consulted have felt it necessary to keep them. There will be no disadvantage to any individual.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It is just an hour and five minutes since we resumed after dinner, and we have disposed of five Clauses—Clauses 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18. That is substantial progress, which I am sure is in keeping with the Minister's hopes expressed earlier this evening.

This would be an appropriate moment for the Committee to adjourn. We have made good progress. It is now clear that substantially more progress will be achieved early next week, and I am confident that we will complete the Bill comfortably during the course of next week.

It would be to our general convenience to adjourn now. The winding-up speeches on the major debate downstairs have started, and I am sure that it would be the wish of hon. Members to participate in the debate, so that they can cast their votes wisely at Ten o'clock. It would be
