	<p>	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee do meet this day at Four o'clock.—[	<i>Dr. Dickson Mabon.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
</section>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 38</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>RESTRICTION ON EXERCISE BY PUBLIC AUTHORITIES OF POWER OF DISPOSING OF LAND</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed</i> [	<i>8th May</i>], That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the end of the last meeting I was trying to find out what were the intentions of the Government and to what extent this Clause would mean that approval would be needed from the Secretary of State for the sale of council houses. The Minister will now have had an opportunity of considering carefully the point which I was raising.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can summarise it in this way for the Minister, by putting three questions to him. First, does he agree that at present there are situations in which local authorities can quite correctly sell houses without seeking the approval of the Secretary of State—for example, where such houses are new, have not been approved for housing needs, and have not been subsidised?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, does this Clause now alter that situation and require the local authority to ask for the Secretary of State's approval whenever any house is proposed to be sold?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, if that is the effect of the Clause, why are the Government seeking now to cover these houses for which at present there is no need for the Secretary
	<span class='label label-info column'>440</span>
of State's permission to be given because they have not attracted subsidy and have not been used for housing needs?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Dr. J. Dickson Mabon)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to follow the hon. Gentleman in his three questions. The first question is in relation to houses built without subsidy or the promise of a subsidy—I think that distinction is important, too—and whether they can be sold without the consent of the Secretary of State. The answer is "yes". It has always been the case and this Clause does not seek to change that. Any house on which a subsidy has been paid is within this Clause and within previous legislation. This applies also to houses where there has been a promise of payment, that is to say, even before the first payment of subsidy has been made, the Secretary of State has the right of certain powers, which are tightened up in this Clause, over sanction to sell.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So the answer to these questions is that if there is a house which has been built by a local authority without subsidy or promise of subsidy—and in the case of the example given about the house in this circumstance and which was replaced because of road improvements—the answer would be that no sanction would be needed. Does this Clause alter the situation regarding these houses? The answer is "No". It alters only the situation regarding houses subsidised or having been promised a subsidy. Therefore, the third question does not arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. G. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful that the Minister has now given an explanation in answer to the points which I raised at the last meeting. I shall not open up the whole question of sale of council houses in appropriate circumstances. I made a fleeting reference to that at our last meeting. I am glad that the Minister has made it clear that the position is not changed where local authorities at present can sell without asking the permission of the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that he should think it necessary to stipulate that the Secretary of State's approval should be sought where there is a promise of a subsidy and even where no subsidy is to be used. There clearly could be a case where when a house was first being built the local authority thought that it would be for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1059">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>441</span>
housing needs, but then decided that it would not be required for housing needs, and did not ask for a subsidy for it at all; it seems unnecessary to cover that case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is satisfactory to find that the Government are not trying to alter the position entirely so that the permission of the Secretary of State has to be asked in every case. We believe that it should not be necessary for local authorities to have to go to the Secretary of State all the time on these matters, but the Minister's clarification shows that he is not trying to be doctrinaire in this case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Clause ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
</section>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 39</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>NEW PROVISIONS RESTRICTING DEMOLITION ETC. OF LISTED BUILDINGS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 145, in page 37, line 29, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'and which has been the subject of written notification to the owner informing him that it is so listed sent to him by Recorded Delivery mail'.</p></blockquote>
I am a little sorry that we appear to have to be galloping through this part of the Bill, particularly when one remembers that the English Bill took some 73 hours and 54 Sittings, whereas we have been only some 22½ hours so far. There is a tradition that we Scots like to examine and scrutinise our legislation with much greater care than the English do. Nevertheless, I shall do my very best to oblige the Committee by going through my Amendments as quickly as I can, but having, as I do, the honour to represent a constituency embracing the New Town of Edinburgh, which has been described by Professor Hitchcock as the most extensive example of a classical romantic city in the world, and what I would describe as a treasure trove of architectural and historical excellence, I feel a great weight of responsibility on my shoulders in ensuring that desired achievements in the field of preservation do not become simply wishful thinking. Once we have allowed an historic building to go it will never be replaced. Each generation must, therefore, act as
	<span class='label label-info column'>442</span>
trustees for the next in the context of this priceless heritage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I commend the Government for doing what they are doing in this legislation, and in this Clause particularly, I am unhappy about the way in which it is being done. We seem to be getting an absolute hotpotch of legislation gushing out of the pipeline—what the Minister described as "generosity of legislation"—and much of this is overlapping. We have considerable example of that in the context of the Amendment. We have several Acts, such as the Town and Country Planning Act, 1947, several Housing Acts, the Civic Amenities Act, all of which overlap to some extent. I think that the need for consolidating legislation is becoming ever more necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Amendment is a result of representations made to me by a body in my constituency. I am grateful for that, although I must confess that I could have done with a good deal more guidance and advice from some of these eminent societies who always act with great speed and decision when the bulldozers move in, but beforehand tend to sit on the sidelines rather peacefully. I would have welcomed rather more constructive assistance from them in ensuring that this Bill is right. I do not blame them, because I know that they are all busy men, leading very full lives. They look upon preservation as a hobby, and they have utmost confidence in the hon. Gentleman and myself to do what is legislatively necessary. I hope that they will not turn round, after this Bill becomes an Act, and tell us that it is no good, because if they do they will bear some of the responsibility for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will admit straight away that the point of this Amendment is covered by Section 28(4) of the Town and Country Planning Act, 1947; so I do not wish to labour the point unduly; but fair chunks of the 1947 Act are being repealed by this Bill, including a good deal of what comes before that particular Section and much that comes after it, including the whole of Section 27 and parts of Section 28, after subsection (4). I would have thought that, instead of leaving a little isolated part of the 1947 Act intact, it would have been much more convenient to have incorporated it in this Bill—more convenient, in particular, for those who have to interpret it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1060">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>443</span>
This point concerns notifying owners that their buildings are listed. I should add, provisionally listed as well, as I think this is an important point. I have four brief points in connection with this. First of all, I think it is essential, in view of the very powerful penalties which we have later on in the Bill, to ensure that everyone who owns or lives in a house which is listed knows that it is listed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I am informed by the Edinburgh Architectural Association that in the New Town, for example, where virtually all the houses are listed, in some areas notification of statutory listing has not yet taken place, and I gather it might take twenty years or so to be able to accomplish notification of statutory listing. So I think we have to work on a provisional listing idea as much as we can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third point is the question of re-notification, because many of the buildings which were listed perhaps as long ago as twenty years may now have changed hands several times and the owners and occupiers may very well be totally ignorant of the fact that their houses are listed, and, therefore, may out of pure ignorance do something which would bring great penalties on their heads. Do the Government have in mind to take the opportunity in the passing of this Bill to re-notify those who are concerned? It may well be that this is something which could be done perhaps every twenty-five years as a matter of routine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My fourth point is to suggest that there might be another way by which this could be overcome, namely, by providing that a plaque of some description, insignificant, but nicely designed, should be fastened to the wall of every listed house on rather the same lines as the Sun Insurance Company used to do several hundred years ago so that the company could distinguish between the houses which were insured by them and were worth quenching if they caught alight, and those houses which were not covered by them. I wonder if this could possibly be considered by the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think this is a fairly important point, and I hope that the Minister will look at it sympathetically, although this is partly in the nature of a probing Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>444</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. A. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take it the noble Lord is principally interested in the preservation of the New Town of Edinburgh. Edinburgh Corporation is now alive to the necessity of preserving these buildings. I think it would be a mistake to think in terms of single buildings, with labels attached to them, because the value of the New Town is not in single buildings but in the complete scheme of buildings. The mere preservation of 5, Charlotte Square, would be no use at all unless the whole of Charlotte Square were preserved. What the Historic Buildings Council has done, with Edinburgh Corporation, has been to enlist the owners in the different areas to form associations themselves, in order to preserve these buildings and to see that they do not deteriorate. Merely to list them and then allow them to deteriorate to a stage where the cost of preserving them would be enormous is to court disaster in the preservation of the City of Edinburgh.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10 45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman is kindly strengthening my argument, because he quite rightly says we have to consider whole streets of Edinburgh. It may be the individual houses may not be strikingly meritorious in terms of architecture or history, and therefore it is all the more essential that the owners are notified that the houses they live in, which may not appear to justify it, are in fact listed houses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The idea is that north Edinburgh and that part of north Edinburgh should be preserved as a whole as far as possible, and this means groups of buildings and streets, and whole areas. The Secretary of State has co-operated with Edinburgh Town Council and with the Historic Buildings Council in getting this done and I am very glad to say that in the case of Melville Street, and in the case of other parts of the area, these associations are now active.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cost of doing this might rise to £20 million or £30 million. This is an enormous cost to face, and if preservation is to be done, and some of the high cost avoided, it must be done before deterioration takes places. I am very glad to say that this is in progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1061">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>445</span>
I can only hope it is done soon enough to see that Edinburgh is preserved, because it would be a disaster not only for Edinburgh but for the country as a whole if this wonderful area, perhaps the earliest piece of real town planning in the world, were to be destroyed by carelessness and allowing things to deteriorate. So far I think the matter is in hand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I quite agree with the noble Lord that a sense of urgency ought to be imparted to it, but the listing of single buildings I do not think would be the wisest way. It is far better to make everybody conscious that he has a heritage in his possession, and that it is the duty of a community as a community to play a part in it—the owners as well as the community—and if this is done, then Edinburgh can be preserved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr, Dickson Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I very much agree with what my right hon. Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn) has said, and I am obliged to the hon. Gentleman the Member for Edinburgh, North (Earl of Dalkeith) for his remarks as well. He suggested that it would take us about twenty years to carry out the present statutory listing of the non-provisional permanent variety. I can give the Committee this figure right at the beginning, that so far we have 2,000 buildings out of 18,000 statutorily listed and it would be quite reasonable to underline what the noble Lord has said, namely, that it will probably take us twenty years under this system to achieve the listing of all these buildings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, it is a rather long and complicated process, and we will come to this later, on subsection (9).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I am trying to say to the noble Lord is that I accept this point about the urgency of this matter. I accept that we ought to speed up the provisional listing. We are handing that over to the local authorities, and we are trying to quicken up the listing so that we will get it done, we hope, in about two years from now, rather than twenty years from now. I think everyone will agree that it is very important to get ahead with that if we are to make any real impact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>446</span>
I accept the point which the hon. Gentleman made about his Amendment, that we are to some extent covering it by Sections of the 1947 Act. In paragraph 14 of Schedule 8 to this Bill provision is made for this notification to become the responsibility of the local burgh authorities instead of the Secretary of State. That should speed up matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So that the Amendment, as such, with which I agree, is unnecessary, because of this changeover and because of the early reference to the previous Act. I would hope that as soon as we can after the passing of this Bill, and after we have consulted the Scottish Law Commission on a number of priorities about other consolidation Measures, we will bring in a consolidation Measure governing town and country planning in Scotland, because I realise that it is very important to have these matters, including this Clause, brought up in a consolidated form for easier reference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of the plaque, we are very glad to know that East Lothian has already started an experiment of this kind, and since it will be a matter of persuading local authorities that this is a good thing to do, we will watch the results of the East Lothian experiment with great interest. There are certain administrative difficulties about these plaques, which I cannot go into at this moment, but it is essentially a good idea. If we do not do it in the form of a plaque, may be there will be some other way of doing it, so that there would be this physical attachment on the building to bring its importance to the notice, not just of the owner or the lessee or the new occupier, but also, indeed, of the general public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are the questions that the hon. Gentleman asked me, and I am obliged to him for moving this Amendment, but I hope he will agree that it is not necessary to make this Amendment to Clauses, because it is already covered by previous provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. G. D. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are one or two points I would like to ask the Minister on which I am not quite clear. Did he say that there were 2,000 that had been properly listed out of the 18,000 provisionally listed? Was that the figure that he was giving? If it was, then was he saying that the local authorities were
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1062">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>447</span>
going to get on with notifying the provisional listing, or was he saying that the whole process of provisional listing was to start with the local authorities and there was some change? Because I must say that, though I have great confidence in local authorities, they do not always recognise the value of their historic heritage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman pointed out that Edinburgh is now aware of this, and I am very glad to hear that, but, of course, in the case of Edinburgh, we are talking of buildings which are over 200 years old, and people usually recognise the value of buildings in direct proportion to their age. What I, representing one of the cities, Glasgow, am concerned about is that the simply magnificent—and there is no other word for it—Victorian heritage which Glasgow is fortunate enough to possess is recognised soon enough to see that it is listed, because then Scotland will have something which is absolutely unique; within forty miles of each other, a superb eighteenth century town and, forty miles to the West, in Glasgow, a superb town of Victorian buildings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would just like to be sure that the process of provisional listing will not rely entirely on the initiative of the local authorities, that it will be pressed ahead, and that notice such as my hon. Friend suggests will be given as well as statutory notice. If the Minister could deal with these points, I would be most grateful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the difficulties, both in Edinburgh and Glasgow, is the reluctance to commit themselves to an unknown expenditure, perhaps running into huge sums of money. Indeed, if this is treated too romantically, it would destroy the object of it, and there has to be a very realistic assessment of what can be preserved, because it may be impossible to preserve everything and, therefore, a selection has to be made, to preserve the best and making sure of that, and not destroying the lot by trying to overstretch the resources of Edinburgh and Glasgow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely with the interjection by the right hon. Gentleman and I think that his views and mine are largely similar. Obviously one cannot preserve everything. The important thing is to preserve groups, though—not
	<span class='label label-info column'>448</span>
just the best building, but the best groups, so that future generations may know what bits of eighteenth century Edinburgh really looked like, and what bits of nineteenth century Edinburgh looked like; not just an odd building here and there which means comparatively little.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Adam Hunter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just one question to my hon. Friend. As a matter of interest, would he tell me how many have been listed in the last four years?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will remember the discussions on the Civic Amenities Act, 1967, and I think it is fair to say that, in the last half dozen years or so, there has been an immense consciousness of this, because a great deal of the effort towards preserving building has come from the Civic Trust and other societies like that. Individual Members. I will not name any Members just now, but those of us who served on the Committee on the Civics Amenities Bill know that a lot of hard work was done by individual Members on this. I think it is interesting that, of the 2,000 properties that we have statutorily listed in Scotland, the overwhelming bulk, some 1,800, have been registered in the last four or five years, but it will take us some time, I would think another twenty years or so, as the noble Lord said, under present procedures to get on to the 18,000 buildings that would have to be statutorily listed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What are the buildings? Are these buildings provisionally listed? I am just not certain what the hon. Gentleman is referring to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are provisionally listed but, as the noble Lord knows, and I am surprised at the hon. Gentleman not recalling this from his previous experience with all his arguments from time to time on the buildings in Glasgow. I think Glasgow has done remarkably well in the buildings it has managed to keep, although there have been one or two setbacks, just as in Edinburgh. On the whole, it has done remarkably well in keeping its buildings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact is that we are converting the provisional lists into statutory lists, and under this Clause we will be transferring the notification process, which is what the noble Lord is seeking to explore just now, to the local authorities.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1063">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>449</span>
Hence his very sensible suggestion about plaques. I am, not saying plaques are the right answer, but we are already doing this in East Lothian, and I am sure the local authorities will want to see if this is a successful experiment that they should copy, or whether it is not and whether they should devise some other way of doing it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So I wish to say to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith) that we are on the same side this morning—though it may be uncomfortable. We are now abandoning the provisional list system. It is taking us far too long. Even with a lot of energy in the last four or five years, we have only managed to do some 1,800— 1,830, to be precise—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is statutory listing which is being abandoned?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. Statutory listing. We are abandoning that in the sense that we are converting the provisional list system, to have more meaning, and going about the notification procedure in this way. It will obviously be easier to notify persons concerned where local authorities are doing it from a list that we already have, than it would be for the Secretary of State to do it, with all the process of follow-up that there must be, and so on, in relation to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is what the noble Lord was asking me to comment on, and I agree with the sense of this Amendment. The only point I am making to him is that, as a probing Amendment, I think it has done well, but we do not have to make the Amendment to the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope my hon. Friend has taken note of the point, which I think is now accepted, that there will be a good deal of need for consolidating legislation in all these matters when he moves to the seat across the way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of the fact that it does appear that the Minister is fully apprised of the urgency of this point, and in particular the need for letting it be known to those who own and occupy these buildings that they are provisionally or statutorily listed—it really does not matter which, so that they are listed in some form or another and so long as people do not do things which they ought not to do—and in
	<span class='label label-info column'>450</span>
view of the assurances the Minister has given that he is well apprised of these points, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 146, in page 37, line 31, leave out from 'works' to 'and' in line 34 and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'affecting the appearance of a listed building'.</p></blockquote>
It seeks to delete the word "character" as a criterion in deciding whether changes that have taken place in a building are good or bad.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whenever I try to suggest sensible changes to legislation, the lawyers nearly always jump down my throat and say that the wording I have chosen gives rise to dubiety and uncertainty and therefore is no good. It seems to me that this is a case where the boot is on the other foot. This Amendment has been drawn to my attention by somebody of rather greater wisdom than myself who has suggested that "character" is a very difficult word to define in law. I would have thought that most lawyers would go out of their way to try to avoid using words which are so abstract as "character" or "atmosphere", and would prefer to stick to something which relates rather more closely to the actual physical features of a building. Hence my attempt to make a modest improvement to the wording which I took to be merely a repeat of wording used in the 1947 and various other Acts, including the English Act. I would have thought that, as we get older we get wiser, and it might have seemed appropriate to have been a little more specific.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I shall be told that there have not been many law cases to test this. I do not know, but it does not mean to say that there will not be in the future. I therefore suggest that this Amendment may be considered, certainly by the lawyers, with some enthusiasm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was the main purpose of moving this Amendment, but at the same time I am also trying to do a bit of tidying up of rather a lot of verbage. I know that the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) is always very keen to try to streamline phraseology wherever this can possibly be done, and I am sure I can count on his support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1064">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>451</span>
	<p>11.0 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a good deal of sympathy with this Amendment, because I live in the Newtown of Edinburgh, and I do not know what is meant by changing "the character" of buildings. I should have thought the feature was purely an architectural one, and anything that destroyed the architectural beauties, for instance, of Charlotte Square, or of any of the streets in north Edinburgh, destroys the value of the New Town, and therefore the New Town as an example of town planning. I do not necessarily agree that the hon. Gentleman's words are right, but I think he has got a point here. What does "character" mean in relation to Charlotte Square, Edinburgh? What does character mean in relation to the street in which I live, Great King Street? What does it mean? I just do not know. There is no point in preserving Great King Street unless we preserve its architectural features. Therefore it seems to me that the noble Lord is raising a point of some importance—that is, the appearance—because if we once destroy that I cannot see that there is anything left much to preserve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The word "character" is properly denned, I am told, in Statute as
	<br><blockquote><p>"a building of special architectural or historic interest"</p></blockquote>
and we have already, as the noble Lord knows, under the General Development Order, certain rights—for example I think he was referring, in "appearance"—at least I would assume so—to certain specialised colourings. I am thinking here perhaps of the Mediaeval town rather than the New Town of Edinburgh. We could issue an Article 4 direction which could require an express application for permission to paint. These directions could cover, for that matter, not just a single building, but, indeed, buildings of a specific class. I really must rely on the legal advice given to me that the phrase "character"—the phrase as in the Clause—
	<br><blockquote><p>"its character as a building of special architectural or historic interest"</p></blockquote>
has in fact been tested by time and has not proved adverse, but on the other hand the phrase that is suggested for substitution—"affecting the appearance" might be open to a number of misinterpretations and could in fact not have the same effect as the phrase in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>452</span>
But I cannot base my argument in rejecting the Amendment on that score. I wanted to make this point to the noble Lord because I am sure he has committed an inadvertence here in his anxiety to shorten the length of this Bill, and that is, that he does strike out the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"for the demolition of a listed building or for its alteration or extension".</p></blockquote>
Now it is absolutely essential, to avoid any possible doubt, that demolition is subject to control. I am sure the noble Lord is absolutely at one with me on that. Demolition must be controlled so we could not make this Amendment, and strike out these words, without leaving a great big question mark over the subject of whether demolition was subject to control or not. There is no doubt in the mind of any Member of this Committee—as far as I appreciate it—that demolition ought to be within control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So I would say to the noble Lord really that we ought not to make his Amendment. It is dangerous—inadvertently dangerous; but dangerous in striking out these initial words; it is possibly ambiguous and certainly untested in law to use the word "appearance" instead of the word "character".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the hon. Gentleman would not consider that the demolition of a building would not affect its appearance? That would be disappearance. The Amendment covers that point. It covers everything. If we add on to a building, it affects its appearance. If we remove it altogether, that affects its appearance. My Amendment is all-embracing—I should have thought, in the most all-embracing way one could possibly find. I am sorry the hon. Gentleman is being dominated by legal advice which overrules his better judgment in this matter. But there it is. I hope he will think about this again, and that perhaps we may have a test case—in which I hope I am not personally involved—at some future date which will bring this to the forefront of our minds again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
"Character" is such an incredibly nebulous word. It could be argued that alterations carried out to a certain house in Charlotte Square, which is to be made the headquarters or the home of the Secretary of State for Scotland, affected its character—by the fact that such a person is going to live there. It might be argued this enhances its character; it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1065">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>453</span>
could be argued that it does the reverse. No doubt we would all agree that the character of Great King Street is enhanced by the presence of the right hon. Gentleman. But this should not, I would have thought, be a proper criterion on which to judge this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not press my Amendment because I dare say that my words are not a very great improvement but I would like this to be looked at again with rather more thought.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is a wee bit unfair to me, because, after all, we can demolish a good bit of the building, and that still would be demolition, but it would not involve the entire disappearance of the building, in the first place, and it is also desirable—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, but my right hon. Friend really ought to be examined to see how his hearing is going. I am shouting as loud as I can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I may say it is desirable to mention the two matters, demolition and alteration or extension together, because if we look closely at the whole Clause as it stands, these two different types of work, right at the outset, are important, because later in the Bill there are provisions applying to demolition, which do not apply to other works, and vice versa. So one has got in this subsection to keep in the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"demolition of a listed building or for its alteration or extension".</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord would be striking these out, for reasons of economy of words. I am all in favour of economy of words, but this is dangerous, and I am putting it to him that that is a different matter from that of "character" as opposed to "appearance", and it is true that where we have two lawyers together we can often have three opinions. The fact is that we do have quite a considerable volume of legal opinion which says if something has been in Statute for some time, has been tried and tested and has not fallen down, then it ought to remain like that. Something that has not been tried is open to possible ambiguity in the courts. Therefore I would suggest to the hon. Gentleman that we do not pursue this, and that he does not insist
	<span class='label label-info column'>454</span>
that I should think about all this again and try and do something on Report, because I really do not feel like doing it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems that the noble Lord thinks that when we put a word in here we are establishing the law, but his own argument went on to show that we only create a new question for the courts to establish the law, and he saw that it would immediately lead to an argument. As he proved himself this morning, an argument can arise quite easily between "appearance" and "character" and if what "character" means has been established by law it would appear to me much more economical, both for the country, and from the point of view of words, to leave the Clause as it is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall resist the temptation which the right hon. Gentleman puts before me to prolong this discussion, in the interests of time, and in the expectation that my hon. Friends will look sympathetically at this rather technical point when they are preparing the consolidating legislation. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The next Amendment is 168. It may be for the convenience of the Committee if, with this Amendment, we also discuss Amendment No. 169, in page 37, line 42, after 'extension', insert 'or change of use', and Amendment No. 170, in Clause 42, page 42, line 5, after 'extension', insert 'or change of use'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 168, in page 37, line 32, after 'extension' insert' or for its change of use'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All of these Amendments cover the insertion of the words "change of use" in the various criteria which are before us. This is a probing Amendment, chiefly. I really wanted to draw attention to the fact that this is a very good example of where the overlapping of legislation is causing a certain amount of confusion. It can doubtless be argued that planning permission for change of use is already necessary and, therefore, that my suggestion is unnecessary, but it is not, as far as I can see, related specifically to listed buildings. I should have thought that it would be a good thing to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1066">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>455</span>
link this to the preservational aspects of buildings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Likewise, it could be held that the Civic Amenities Act virtually covers the point I am seeking to make, and that is also partly true, but I suggest that various things could happen to a building without the need to make structural alterations. Something done can be deleterious, and result in deterioration of the neighbourhood. For instance, in a house in my constituency a man on the ground floor has taken to making ice cream with some very noisy apparatus which grinds away throughout the night and drives the upstairs occupants virtually out of the house. The upstairs part of the house may very well soon become vacant. It has fallen into a terrible state of disrepair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is something which lowers the whole prestige, or perhaps character, of a neighbourhood. A pop group may set up in a house, and drive the neighbourhood into a sorry state of disrepair through people going out of it and people coming in who cannot afford to look after it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Clark Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Launderettes, too, are another offence and pain in this respect. I have had a great problem in Edinburgh with them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has given another example. Planning permission is necessary for such things, but not necessarily in the context of the architecture or the historic value of the building. I know of one street where there is a brothel which rather lowers the tone of the neighbourhood. I do not know whether one would get planning permission for changing use to that; I rather suspect not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To take an extreme case, I would quote Lord Holford, who was speaking to the Cockburn Association only a few days ago and warned the people of Edinburgh about the conflict of interest between economists and preservationists. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For example, from an economic point of view, Edinburgh Castle might attract more revenue to the city as an international hotel.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Cities like Edinburgh will face the most agonising and controversial decisions whether to conserve the past in the interests of history and the tourist trade, or whether to develop and redevelop in the interests of economic growth. This is going to be the crucial question."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>456</span>
That touches upon the point to which I have tried to draw attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one specifically important aspect of this problem in relation to the New Town of Edinburgh, where many residential properties are being converted into offices. In the normal course of events, had the New Town not been the New Town this probably would not have mattered; but it means that a residence previously occupied by, perhaps, two families with two cars, is now an office with, perhaps, 30 people working and bringing 30 cars a day into that area. One must look at the unsightliness of cars cluttering up parts of the New Town in the context of planning permission related to amenities and the listing of buildings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope, therefore, that this Amendment, although it is a probing Amendment, will not be simply dismissed out of hand, because I think that there are some good points to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the noble Lord in stressing the problem that lies before Edinburgh. If it is to be a choice between becoming a workshop or a museum, Edinburgh would have to choose to be a workshop in order to live. The problem is how to harmonise the need to preserve the old without destroying the prosperity of the new. This is a costly business, as the Government are finding in Charlotte Square where, in order to preserve St. George's, £40,000 or £50,000 must be spent on clearing out dry rot. Nevertheless, the building will have a use, and one of the established principles in regard to preservation is that buildings must have a use. This is a very difficult matter in regard to certain old buildings, and may become an economic problem in regard to the very expensive big rooms of the New Town, because the cost of papering and painting them alone nearly destroys the possibility of preserving them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an agonising problem which will face Edinburgh, the local authority, and the Secretary of State in the future, but I hope that we shall be able to resolve it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to support the noble Lord.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Speak up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1067">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>457</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the noble Lord in this matter, because the New Town of Edinburgh certainly is worth preserving, if possible. It is a very fine example, not only of town planning but domestic architecture at its best. If the New Town is an example of planning and domestic architecture, as soon as it ceases to be domestic, its character is destroyed. That is logical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What disturbs me about the New Town of Edinburgh is the gradual encroachment of every kind of occupancy other than residential. I think of the street in which I live. I have not only had a brothel next door to me for a certain period of time, but opposite to me a hotel has now opened a discotheque. A few yards farther along there is a gambling club, and goodness knows what. All this sort of thing destroys the character of the street. It had a character as a residential area, and this, certainly, was its importance. If it is to become an area of hotels and gambling clubs and offices with plates stuck all over the wall and neon lights flaming in the windows, it loses its character.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We ought to take change of use into account when considering the preservation of buildings. I understand that at present one has to get permission for certain, though not all, changes of use. There are certain allied uses for which permission is not needed, but there are other changes for which planning permission is needed. In the New Town, one is always given the answer that all that is required is planning permission, but planning permission should be linked with the preservation of buildings for their character or, as the Bill says, for their character as works
	<br><blockquote><p>"… of special architecural or historic interest".</p></blockquote>
This seems to me to be a point which is worthy of some consideration, and it is particularly true of Edinburgh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to see most of the New Town preserved as an area in which people can live. Why should they not live in the centre of the town? If somebody wants a huge block of offices such as we have just had stuck up in the middle of Queen Street, let it be put on the outskirts of the town. If somebody wants some other kind of building, such as, now, a big office building stuck up like a sore thumb in the middle of
	<span class='label label-info column'>458</span>
Hillside Crescent, let it be put on the outskirts of Edinburgh. Let it be put in my constituency. We have lost hundreds of jobs in my constituency, and we could do with a few buildings like that. This seems to me to make sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That people would like to live in the centre of Edinburgh is proved by the fact that most of these houses can be sold very rapidly. People like living in the centre of Edinburgh. They are then handy for everything—for all the cultural activities, and various other things. I feel, therefore that the hon. Gentleman is on a good point here, and one to which my hon. Friend ought to give some attention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should not like to be taken on a tour of icecream shops, laundrettes and other places which have been mentioned this morning which even, quite apart from their use, or their alleged use, are illegal, and I do not wish to go into that matter at the moment, although, as somebody has remarked to me, it would be rather interesting to have these four particular activities going on in the one place, just to see what the outcome would be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The change of use, as the noble Lord pointed out, is in fact a matter that is provided for under planning control in the normal way. For example if the noble Lord's constituent is above an icecream shop and this is not an approved change of use by the planning authority, then, of course, that person can seek an enforcement order to enforce the use of the property downstairs which ought to be residential. If it has been changed, of course it has obviously been changed by the normal planning process, and the upstairs tenant, or whoever is aggrieved by this change of use, ought to have made representations at the time when this was going on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is really a matter which is outwith the discussion at the moment of normal planning activities. What we are talking about here is the application rigidly to listed buildings which are affected by demolition, alteration, extension and so on, of this requirement of no change of use. I know some good examples where change of use has been to the advantage of the preserved building. I can remember, for example, the Western Club in Glasgow. It is, perhaps, by Edinburgh
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1068">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>459</span>
standards not the greatest architectural gem in the world, but by Glasgow standards, the Glasgow Corporation deserve to be commended for the way in which it preserved the Western Club in Glasgow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But in that case, of course, there is a very distinct change of use, as those of us who know the city well realise. So it does not always follow that a change of use is to the detriment of the building which one is seeking to preserve and conserve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might well have been to the advantage of Edinburgh if the New Club in Edinburgh could have been regenerated in the way that the Western Club in Glasgow has.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very glad that the hon. Gentleman made that point, and that I was not driven to make it, because it would appear to be a Glaswegian point rather than an Edinburgh man's point, and a Minister's point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that it has got to be recognised in fairness always to the city that it cannot necessarily accept the compensation involved by insisting on a certain building remaining as it is used, or, may I say, in some cases, unused, in its original use. This is one of the great difficulties. I think that my right hon. Friend was very wise in using the phrase which pretty well sums up this attitude of marrying new use with old use, an old building with a new use, in saying that, in Edinburgh's case, we could quite easily make it a museum by freezing altogether the use of the architectural interest of Edinburgh and the architectural buildings of Edinburgh and keeping them firmly in that use always. We could by that way turn the City into a museum, and incidentally take the Corporation close to bankruptcy in compensation. So one has got to recognise the financial consequences of being strict about this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am in favour, basically, and so are most people, of keeping a building in its present use if it is economically viable so to do, but if the choice is demolition or substantial alteration because one wants to keep it in its original use, or, alternatively, switching it to another use and keeping it essentially the same, I am in favour of the second course of action.
	<span class='label label-info column'>460</span>
That is why I put it to the noble Lord that it would be wrong to make this an absolute requirement that we must keep all listed buildings in their present use. This would defy economics, it would bring the system into some doubt, I question whether it would work, and I put it to him that while in general I accept the principle of this we should operate the other system of planning control to achieve that, rather than impose the listed building system, a mechanism which can defeat itself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clark Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In general, I support what my noble Friend has said. I see the Minister's difficulty, but I do not think that he really understands what we are trying to get at, which is that planning alterations take place which are absolutely stupid and, indeed, fiendish. It is almost impossible to fight against it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My noble Friend mentioned the icecream man; I have had the launderette. This worried me when it moved into a perfectly good Victorian block in Marchmont, and I fought like mad to get rid of it. We even tried under the Factory Acts, but that cannot be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All this sort of thing can be multiplied all over in Edinburgh, and what we want is some tighter planning, or a new lot of people to give planning permission. I do not mind which it is, but the position is very unsatisfactory at the moment. That is why I support my noble Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the Minister of State has interpreted my Amendment as virtually putting a ban on the change of use of buildings. That is not the point. I am trying to insist that when planning permission is being given in respect of listed buildings it is the reasons for the buildings being listed which should be taken into account rather than just the ordinary planning considerations. This is the object of the exercise. I dare say that this aspect is to some extent covered by the Civic Amenities Act, otherwise I would be pressing this a good deal harder.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would be the last to try to argue that we must never change the use of a building. I know of dozens of cases where the survival of the building is due entirely to the fact that it has gone through a change of use: it has been changed from being, perhaps, a residential house into an office, and those who
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1069">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>461</span>
have turned it into an office have been able to spend a good deal more money on its repair and reconstruction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the same time—again talking from experience in my constituency—I know dozens of examples of extremely fine Georgian houses which have been turned into offices. The first thing the inmates have done, not appreciating the magnificent Adam plasterwork and the rest that one finds inside the front hall, has been to rush round with step ladders, hammering up fluorescent lighting tubes and wires all over the place, breaking the plasterwork, and doing all kinds of atrocious things. This does happen, though more often when the use is changed from residential to office than when it is done the other way round.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My Amendment seeks only to relate change of use in the planning permission field to buildings of architectural and historic importance, which is not included in various Housing Acts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that slipping in these words would have the effect that my hon. Friend indicated. But the hon. Gentleman is undoubtedly on to a good point here. Ann Street, in his constituency, is one part of the New Town planning—one of the most charming streets in Edinburgh. Change the use of the houses in Ann Street and the whole point of Ann Street has disappeared. We might just as well pull it all down. That is what the hon. Gentleman has in mind, and it applies to a great many other streets in the New Town of Edinburgh. Planning legislation, as it is operated at the present time, does not cover this problem, and nobody can tell me that to put a row of discotheques in Great King Street—or Melville Street, or any of these places—will add to its beauty, or to preserve the street in the manner in which it ought to be preserved. This is sheer rubbish. My hon. Friend ought to think about it. The Amendment may be unacceptable, but an important point is involved that ought to be considered much more than appears to have been the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad my right hon. Friend the Member of Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) accepts the validity of at least part of my argument. I promise

I would not like to get involved in arguments with individual authorities. The hon. Gentleman the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) has put his finger on the point by saying if we do not like the decisions we ought to get rid of the folk. There is a lot of sense in that, because in many cases the actual decisions are matters of discretion which can be exercised only by the councillors on the spot. That is what the planning committees do—and I do not accept that they are always bad. They may make bad decisions, but on the whole the decisions are relatively good. They vary from one part of the country to another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of Edinburgh New Town, and all the argument that went on about the proposals in the quinquennial review for the inner ring road, and so on, we have authorised the commencement of a study by Professor Buchanan in Edinburgh, working with Freeman and Fox on the transport side, dealing with the question of parking cars and various other forms of traffic management. That study will cost about £160,000, of which £120,000 will rank for grant. The Secretary of State will contribute £60,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Incidentally, to meet my right hon. Friend's point about the character of the New Town, in conjunction with the transport study we are undertaking an assessment of the environmental element in the New Town, as it has been called in the decision letter. That itself will cost about £100,000, of which the Secretary of State is expected to contribute about £50,000. In this bicentenary year we are not unaware of the needs of the New Town—of the need to keep Edinburgh a modern city and yet preserve its heritage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the announcement that I am now making of these studies, and of the sums involved, I can demonstrate the fact that while we do not necessarily accept all the points made by the noble Lord—I do not think he intends that we should accept them; these are really exploratory Amendments—we are essentially on the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1070">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just for the record, may I say an unofficial survey is also taking place on the very points that the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is right enough to take in the whole of the transportation study. The argument of the Edinburgh Corporation at the quinquennial review was based on the influx of people as well as the movement within Edinburgh, so obviously that question has to be touched on by Professor Buchanan. I should be very surprised if, in his report with his associates Freeman and Fox, he did not make reference to this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot promise what the result of the report will be. As we all know from the East of Scotland Land Use Study, those who were concerned with railways were somewhat disappointed because it rejected travelling arrangements and said that the railways would carry more or less what they are carrying now, but that motor car traffic would treble or multiply by a considerable figure, up to 1980.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister of State has given us some welcome information concerning the circular that he is sending out.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is simply a probing Amendment, seeking clarification on the division of responsibility between local authorities and St. Andrew's House. There may well be times when local authorities are as guilty of perpetrating Philistinian crimes as any individual. That point may be sufficiently covered by Clause 54. This is purely an exploratory Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I confirm what the noble Lord said about the nature of his Amendment, and I accept that it is a probing one. If he will be kind enough to look at paragraph 4 of the Fourth Schedule to the Bill he will see that the Department will be informed of all applications for listed building consent, and the Secretary of State will therefore have the opportunity of calling in an application for his own decision if special circumstances warrant it. That is provided in paragraph 3 of the Fourth Schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make this comment because it means that if we were to accept the Amendment it would mean that not only would we be notified of all cases but we would call them in. We should have no default powers, because everything would be in default. On the other hand, the provisions of the Fourth Schedule mean that we do have default powers, and that it is not a case of our discovering something by accident, because there is a regular return of all applications for listed building consent.

We have covered the fact that the Central Government still have this oversight, and still have reserve powers in case the local authority makes an error, or makes one of these dreadful Philistinian horror decisions to which the noble Lord referred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 148, in page 37, line 44, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'having taken due account of the views of the Royal Commission'.</p></blockquote>
This Amendment concerns the question of consultation by the Secretary of State or the local authority with the Royal Commission There seems to be an arguable case in favour of suggesting that the Secretary of State should consult the Royal Commission, or an appropriate body, in practically all cases. It would give added confidence to those whose properties are being dealt with by the Minister or the local authority if they knew that the civil servants concerned were also consulting the people who are the real experts in the buildings concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a little surprised that the Royal Commission should be given a place of such prominence, rather than various other organisations. Why not the Historic Buildings Council, or the Royal Fine Art Commission, or the Georgian Society, the Cockburn Society, or the Victorian Society? Why not, in the context of a certain street, that certain street society? We now have such excellent organisations as the Northumberland Street Society. They would be the proper people to consult in the context of buildings in that street.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As far as I am aware, the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland is not very much concerned with the buildings in a place like the New Town of Edinburgh. I should have thought that the Historic Buildings Council was a more appropriate body.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my right hon. Friend the Member for East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn) knows, the duty of the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland is—and has been, since 1908—simply to record Scottish buildings and monuments of architectural and historic merit, and to specify those which, in its opinion, are worthy of preservation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, the Historic Buildings Council for Scotland is the statutory adviser to the Secretary of State on historic buildings and ancient monuments, under the Act of 1953. So there are two distinct functions here. What the Amendment does is to put a new duty
	<span class='label label-info column'>466</span>
on the Royal Commission, a duty which is being carried out not only by the Secretary of State's own advisers, but in Statute by the Historic Buildings Council for Scotland. I think that that is enough professional advice to be referred to in Statute. I do not say that it is the only professional advice that we should take. For example, we could not make reference to some of the societies mentioned by the noble Lord not because they are not worthy of being mentioned but because they are not statutory bodies; they are not even bodies with a Royal Warrant. One comes back to the old argument that, if one starts to list them, one will omit somebody unintentionally. I feel that it is right and proper that we should make the references here—which we do rightly, I believe—to the function of the Royal Commission, but we do not seek to extend its function which has remained unchanged since 1908.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With that answer, I ask the hon. Gentleman not to persist with the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the hon. Member can refresh my memory. Does the Royal Commission have responsibilities with regard to occupied buildings as well as unoccupied buildings?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister of State has given a sufficient explanation why we have the Royal Commission rather than various other bodies, but he has not answered the point of the first of the two Amendments. He has not said why he does not consider it necessary for the Secretary of State or the local planning authority to consult at the point where I suggest that consultation should take place, namely, in respect of subsection (4)(	<i>a</i>). I would have thought that consultation was necessary later on in respect of demolition. It does not appear to be necessary for other works as mentioned in subsection (4). Is there any reason why this sort of consultation should not take place, and why this provision should not be inserted in this part of the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One must remember that when one uses words like these, even though they seem rather open and expansive and without considerable definition, they are, in fact, a statutory consultation,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1072">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>467</span>
and they change the remit of the organisation. They are a new duty and, if you like, a new right. That is why I do not think it right to make this change. If the Royal Commission, in addition to its statutory function of recording, wishes to offer an opinion, then it is up to it so to do. But the Secretary of State can insist that the Historic Buildings Council for Scotland gives him advice. That is the distinction. He must have one statutory adviser, at least. It is invidious to start to enumerate other statutory advisers as if one were extending a courtesy. The statutory adviser outside the Scottish Office is the Historic Buildings Council for Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would it help the noble Lord and the hon. Gentleman to know that the Historic Buildings Council has access to the information of the Royal Commission? It has continual access and, if necessary, continual advice with regard to the facts of the situation, before it advises the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not trying to get into difficulties with the noble Lord—he is seeking to be helpful here—but what I am trying to do is to point out the theory of advice, which is that when the Secretary of State has an official statutory adviser—which is what the Historic Buildings Council is—it is wrong to proliferate advisers. It is not wrong for the Secretary of State to accept advice from other bodies, in addition to that of his statutory advisers, but I am saying to the noble Lord that it is a mistake to write this in because it only confuses the position. One confuses the position of the Historic Buildings Council, confuses the position of the Royal Commission, and also raises doubts about others who are not mentioned. I do not think that this Amendment is being helpful either to the Royal Commission or the Historic Buildings Council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would it be true to say that the function of these two bodies is different? Is not the prime object of the Royal Commission to provide a kind of catalogue of buildings, whereas the function of the Historic Buildings Council is to advise the Secretary of State on what buildings are worth preserving, or where alterations may be permitted? Is not one cataloguing the existing struc-
	<span class='label label-info column'>468</span>
ture and the other advising on possible changes? Is that right?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is absolutely right. The Royal Commission has not been asked to advise; in fact, in Statute one could argue that it is no part of its duty to advise, but it is very much a part of its duty to record particularly those buildings that are under threat of demolition. That is the Royal Commission's sole function: to record, to catalogue the details of a building which is likely to disappear. Therefore, it has a sense of urgency and a sense of purpose, and it is rather important to keep it with its sole purpose, in view of the critical part that it plays in this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to contribute to the debate, except to say that another institution which exists to give advice is the Royal Fine Art Commission. It is consulted in appropriate circumstances. Indeed, there is a case just now of Crathes Castle, where there has been a fire. In that case reconstruction has been a very important problem. The Fine Art Commission has contributed its advice to the Historic Buildings Council, and that goes through to the Secretary of State. It has made a fine contribution to the eventual satisfactory solution of a difficult problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister of State for the fairly full explanation that he has given on this point. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 149, in page 38, line 9, leave out 'one month' and insert 'three months'.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have had representations from the Royal Commission about this, and I recommend that we make this Amendment to the Bill.

cases meriting its attention. I am much obliged to the noble Lord.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The next Amendment is Amendment No. 150, with which we can take the following Amendments:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 151, in page 38, line 38, leave out' £250 'and insert '£1,000';
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 177, in Clause 44, page 43, line 23, leave out '£400' and insert '£1,000'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 150, in page 38, line 37, leave out 'three months' and insert 'one year'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of this Amendment is to draw attention to the fact that the penalties provided for in the Bill can be extremely tough, although it may not appear to be so to the casual reader whose eye falls on the figure of £250. The object of these penalties is presumably to provide a deterrent, though the real deterrent power in subsection (7) is to be found in rather concealed form in paragraph (	<i>b</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a man wanted to build a shop front on to his Georgian terrace house, thereby enhancing its value by about £5,000, he might be tempted to cock a snook at the authorities and go ahead with the work if he thought that the price for his sin was a mere £250 fine, whereas it could be much more substantial than that, as we see from subsection (7)(	<i>b</i>). The man who glanced at the Bill would say, "Oh, yes, I am only faced with a fine of £250. That is not much in relation to the increased value of my house, so let's go ahead, and to hell with the fine". It is worth drawing attention to the fact that we are introducing some very tough penalties—much tougher than previous penalties—for mucking about with fine old buildings. I hope that it will be made clear to those who might be contemplating a breach of the rules that they ought to think twice before doing so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The noble Lord surprises me. I do not dissent from his argument that we should make it clear that these are tough penalties and not merely what seems to be, at first glance, the figure of £250 or three months because, if they read subsection (7) of this Clause right through, the Committee will see, first
	<span class='label label-info column'>470</span>
of all, it is "or both" in paragraph (	<i>b</i>), and then,
	<br><blockquote><p>"and in determining the amount of any fine to be imposed on a person convicted on indictment the court shall in particular have regard to any financial benefit which has accrued or appears likely to accrue to him in consequence of the offence."</p></blockquote>
So in other words, the fine can be an unlimited fine and there can be an unlimited fine in addition to the prison sentence. So I agree with the noble Lord that these are pretty hefty penalties but, in some cases, a very substantial fine might well be merited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course it would be wrong to make reference to longer than three months and more than £250 or, later on more than £400, if we were not going to make the solemn procedure of trial by judge and jury available. So I would put the point to him that it would be, to some extent, unnecessary and, in the latter argument, with reference to judge and jury procedures, undesirable to make these Amendments as such. However, I would go along with him in his anxiety to stress that this Clause is a very heavy punishment which would fall on anyone who would breach the provisions of this Act, that is to say, that it could be an unlimited fine and it could be, in fact, a term of imprisonment as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodbnrn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend explain where the Clause provides an unlimited fine and an unlimited term of imprisonment? It seems to me that the Clause provides a penalty of up to three months in each case. In any case, will my hon. Friend explain what the difficulty is of writing in the higher penalties? It would not mean that any court was bound to impose them. It could impose smaller penalties. It is only a reserve deterrent, as the noble Lord suggests, and I do not see any reason why the deterrent should not be on paper, even if it is never put into practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my noble Friend and the right hon. Gentleman. I agree that subsection (7)(	<i>b</i>) means that the sky is the limit but I cannot see why in subsection (7)(	<i>a</i>), there should not be a higher figure than £250. That seems a derisory sort of figure in this case. In some instances it might not be as high as that—and, as the right hon. Gentleman points out, there is no need for a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1074">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>471</span>
court to impose it. But it does not look very good, in a Bill like this, to have a figure as low as £250. I hope that the Minister will reconsider the matter and put in a figure of £1,000.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should make the point clear that, if it is the opinion of the Sheriff that the matter ought to be settled by sheriff and jury rather than by sheriff alone, or alternatively, by the High Court, then, of course, these limits do not apply. This is the point of the Clause. In other words, there are two ways of dealing with it. It would be quite wrong for a sheriff, without a jury, to be imposing such penalties. It would be quite out of line with Scottish practice—and I am sorry the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) is not here to support me—to allow a sheriff, without a jury, to have longer terms of imprisonment as the maximum available to him to impose on the guilty party, or higher fines than these figures suggested, without a jury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put that to the Committee. It is not a question that the Government are not willing to put into the Statute higher penalties. It is just that these penalties can only be imposed with a jury trial, and that is a matter for the discretion of the sheriff at the time. So it is not a question of taking sides here. That is why I argued the case that it was undesirable, in the first place, to leave the sheriff with a higher limit than is normal, and it was unnecessary, if one was worried about seeking to get tougher measures because you have these words which I read out at the beginning, and you would have this ability to punish the offender quite substantially in line with what he seems to have secured by breaching the law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that there are very sound technical reasons which make my Amendment unnecessary, but if, by our discussion, we have let it be more widely known that the sky is the limit in respect of a breach of these rules we shall have done a good service to some people who might unintentionally have wandered into a trap which brought very heavy penalties on their heads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>472</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 152, in page 39, line 2, after 'building', insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'or for the restoration of the building to bring it more closely into line with its original architectural design'.</p></blockquote>
This, again, is a probing Amendment, in which I seek to extend the reasons which can be given for defence of a person's actions in subsection (8). I would have liked to suggest that we considered this restoration point as an additional reason for defence. I can best illustrate what I am getting at by giving a few brief examples.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A man might wish to replace plate-glass windows with proper sash windows with astragals, thus making a profound difference to the appearance of the building. This ought to be encouraged, and not discouraged by procedures which involve a certain amount of delay, frustration and irritation. Anything that we can do to encourage people to do this sort of thing without going through a lot of time-wasting procedure will be for the better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A man might be repairing the roof of his house following a hurricane of the sort we had last January. While the builders were present and on the job—they might have their scaffolding there, and all manner of equipment—the man might suddenly decide that it would be a good thing to demolish a later appendage to his house, which was spoiling its architectural features and that while all the men and equipment were there it would be simple just to whip it off, thereby restoring the house to its original shape and form. I wonder whether this is a point which should be thought about before the Bill is passed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would not be wise to incorporate this Amendment, because, if the Committee follow me, in subsection (8) it is to be a defence for a person in this position
	<br><blockquote><p>"… to prove that the works were urgently necessary in the interests of safety or health, or for the preservation of the building …"</p></blockquote>
To quote the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"to restore the building to bring it more closely into line with its original architectural design",</p></blockquote>
that does not mean to say necessarily its original condition, that is, original before the danger which caused the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1075">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>473</span>
urgency to arise about health, safety, or weatherproofing, for example, because of damage to the building in some way or other. It might be the case that one might have to wait a year or eighteen months to get the precise form of material needed to do this. What happens in the interval? The owner really cannot be left in this position where he has no defence because he has not got the original material, whatever it may be. Therefore, he is allowed this defence, because of, in the words here, "health or safety"—not just his health, by the way, or his safety, but that of the public as well—and, of course, "the preservation of the building". It could be not just a window; it could be a wall or part of the wood surrounding the windows, and things like that. It could be quite critical to the preservation of the building. I put it to the hon. Gentleman that it is wrong to put in a long-term requirement in what is in fact a short-term provision of urgency. I would ask him not to make the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last point is, perhaps, this: who decides what the original architectural design was? Under this Amendment, it would in fact be the party concerned. I do not think that would be desirable. I do not think that the Secretary of State's advisers would accept that the best person to decide this would be the person who is seeking to put up this defence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So the Amendment is defective and almost self-defeating in that way. I take the noble Lord's point, nevertheless, that it would be useful if, in conjunction with urgency, one were to try to do this kind of thing, but it may not always be possible. That is why the Amendment would not be a good Amendment to make.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Northumberland Street Association brought this matter to my attention. This is a new and very active group working to try to preserve Northumberland Street. In the interests of time, I shall merely read an extract from the letter which I received. It appears that subsection (9), together with Schedule 10 in page 126, repeals Section 28 (5), (6), (7) and (8) of the 1947 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can draw attention to the point by reading the following extract.
	<br><blockquote><p>Section 28(5) of the 1947 Act, which provides that the fact that a building has been listed shall be recorded in the Register of Sasines, is to be repealed by Schedule 10 of the new Bill. The process of recording is apparently thought to have absorbed too much time and money. If section 28(5) is repealed, it will be necessary for conveyancers to make an additional Search when examining title. This would be most unfortunate, firstly because the complications and expense of conveyancing are so frequently criticised that simplification rather than complication of procedure is essential, and secondly because it is most important that all information relating to property should be centralised as far as possible at Register House.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>I feel very strongly that the repeal should be discouraged…</p></blockquote>
The writer deals with the point more adequately than I can, and I shall be most interested to hear the Minister's reaction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to respond to the noble Lord's invitation. Section 27 is repealed. That provides for the making of Building Preservation Orders, but Part V of the Bill, in effect, puts a Building Preservation Order on all statutorily listed buildings. That is the first point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 28(6) and (7) in the 1947 Act provide for advance notification to local planning authorities and the Secretary of State of proposals to demolish or alter listed buildings. This is replaced by the provisions in this Bill which require specific assent. The Secretary of State, as I have said earlier, will be notified of these applications under paragraph 4 of Schedule 4. Section 28(8) provides the penalties we have discussed, and of course we have the appropriate provisions here in this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last provision which we repeal by this subsection (9) is Section 28(5). We had an earlier discussion about the

	<span class='label label-info column'>475</span>
Register of Sasines and the very detailed manner in which we are obliged to do things at the present time, which means that we should have to have an enormously large staff spending a great deal of time in order to be able to achieve the speedy completion of the listing of all the properties. By the way, without that, we cannot get Part V of this Bill really working.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are repealing Section 28(5) because, as I said earlier, this is a far better way to do it. This is the way we are going to do it, and we should like to do it in two or three years with the help of the fifty-odd planning authorities rather than in the twenty years or so that we think it will take to get through the remaining 18,000 listed properties, on present form.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This is mainly a probing Amendment to try to discover the significance, if any, of the word "immediately".

This passage might have read better if we had said
	<br><blockquote><p>"Every building which, at the commencement of this Part of this Act, …"</p></blockquote>
Whether or not we have the word "immediately" may make much difference, it means that under the subsection the Alhambra Theatre in Glasgow will not be included. I am rather curious to know whether it will in future be deemed to be listed on the grounds of its architecture or its historical associations.

Here we are perhaps walking on rather delicate ground or perhaps we should say, on holy ground. We ought to be removing our shoes, tip-toeing rather gently. The purpose of these Amendments is to probe, and to seek more clarification because there are one or two examples which I have in mind which may give cause for a little uncertainty in the future as to what one means by "an ecclesiastical building".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One quite often finds in various towns and cities convents which, I suppose, are ecclesiastical buildings. Yet they occupy perfectly ordinary, straightforward houses. There is a convent in my constituency, in Drummond Place, occupying three houses which have been put into one. It would appear that under the terms of this Clause that place will be exempted from the other provisions of the Bill. And yet the houses are no different from any other houses in Drummond Place. I would not for a moment suggest that the inmates, the Mother Superior or the nuns, would do anything to the houses which was bad. Indeed, they deserve the highest possible praise for the very high
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1077">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>477</span>
standard to which they maintain these buildings, which are a very good example of how places should be cared for in a particularly beautiful part of Edinburgh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, other problems might arise in churches. One might have the situation whereby Dr. Whitley, for instance, became so successful that he was filling St. Giles' Cathedral beyond capacity. He might then decide that he should start building galleries all round the inside of the church in order to accommodate additional people. As far as I can tell, he dare not go ahead and do this irrespective of any consent from any of the bodies we have been discussing earlier on. Or, unlikely as it may be, he may receive a very attractive offer from the United States to trans-ship the entire edifice to Minnesota, or some such place. This happened the other day to a church in Buckinghamshire, which was quite suddenly picked up and it has been transplanted to America. It might be rather a pity if St. Giles' Cathedral suddenly vanished. This may be stretching a point, but it is something which, as far as I can see, could happen under this exemption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure what is the intention of the Government. The Churches, I am certain, can be trusted to act highly sensibly in every possible way. Nevertheless they could find themselves confronted an almost irresistible temptation, and there is nobody at all who can say "Yea" or "Nay" to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The one organisation which we always expect to be able to resist even irresistible temptation is the Church, and the Church has in the past resisted temptation in respect of many of its buildings. By the Church I mean the Church corporate, not just the church of one denomination. But take my own Church, the Church of Scotland. I am quite certain that no Presbytery, no elder or member of the session in St. Gile's, would assent to anything within St. Gile's which would be harmful to the structure and dignity of what is in fact one of Scotland's finest cathedrals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not only are we discussing here whether or not we should have control over the Church, or rather, the Church's
	<span class='label label-info column'>478</span>
buildings, but also what would our attitude be to other Churches, apart from the Established Church in Scotland and the Established Church in England, because, of course, the parallel must follow on. It has always been the case that while the Secretary of State, under both Governments has not been precluded from making grants to churches in use, it has been in fact the policy of successive Governments not to make such grants and there has never been a proposal by any Government, so far as I am aware, to the Church that we should have a kind of 	<i>quid pro quo</i> system, that if we give it grants it should allow us to list and control its buildings. That has never been proposed, and I would suspect—I am not prophesying or anything like that—I would suspect that a proposition of that character would have to come in the first instance from the Church itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know in these hypothetical circumstances what the Government would do, but I can say that under this legislation the Government could do little or nothing, apart from arousing public indignation at any suggestion of the kind of things that the noble Lord is referring to. Of course we might have emergency legislation. That is possible. After all, in the House of Commons, even though it might surprise some of us, we can get a Bill through in 24 hours, through both houses—if the House of Commons and the House of Lords so wish it to be, and Her Majesty concurs. We could do that, but I do not think we should really base a Bill like this on quite extraordinary hypothetical circumstances like that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The very serious issue which the hon. Gentleman raises is, should we in this Bill change the circumstance in relation to the Churches? We have always respected the independent position of the Church in the conduct of its affairs, and as long as religious practices continue within the churches—in other words, they are maintained for their original use—we have never sought to interfere with the Church's use of these buildings. And frankly, I think we are on a very difficult, indeed treacherous path, if we start to nibble at this rather than face up to the central issue itself. I would suggest to the noble Lord that this is a matter which is worthy of discussion with the Churches collectively rather than discussing it in this Committee and seeing
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1078">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>479</span>
initiative coming from the Government on this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree very largely with what the Minister has said, but he has been talking about the established or well-known Churches. It would seem to me that quite a lot might hinge on the interpretation of the word "ecclesiastical". We have established in Edinburgh the Scientologists. Are they ecclesiastical? Because they might act very unreasonably, and from what I know and read of them, that is highly probable. So this word "ecclesiastical" needs some interpretation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a very important Amendment that we are discussing and I do not really know that I can accept the view put forward by the Minister. He has great faith in the Church, and I have great faith in the Church, in things that the Church is competent to give a judgment about, and that is, religious matters, but the Church's kingdom is not on earth, and it is precisely because the Church's kingdom is not on earth that it may take a view of architectural beauty which is different from that which would be applied to other organisations owning a building. We have had instances where there seems to be a clash between what the Church thinks is its interest and the architectural interest—for example, in Glasgow, with regard to the Park Church. The argument is, and this is coming up more and more often, that as people move away from the centres of towns and establish themselves outside or on the periphery of a town the central churches should be sold and site value obtained so that new churches may be built. Now, I have got absolutely no sympathy with this attitude at all. Our ancestors built these churches without having a great big capital sum given to them, and they have become part of our heritage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is extremely dangerous to suggest that the only part of our community which should be outside the planning concept should be the Churches. As I say, I have great faith in them on those matters on which they are competent to deal, but I do think that, when it comes to planning matters, we should subject them to exactly the same sort of control as applies to the owners of other buildings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>480</span>
I do not think that the hon. Gentleman was quite right when he said that the Church never obtained grants, because I think that the Cathedral Church in Glasgow is in fact the property of, or certainly is preserved by, the Ministry of Works, and I think that this is a very right and proper thing, and, although my noble Friend's point about St. Gile's Cathedral is probably a little far-fetched, there are other churches, not of the same national distinction, as my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) pointed out, which should be preserved, and should I believe not be exempted from the planning procedure merely because they happen to belong to religious bodies. Because, as I say, although one may trust ministers and Church sessions and all the rest of it, in ecclesiastical matters, when it comes to architectural matters they should not, to my mind, be in a privileged position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A very important point has been raised here. It would clearly be quite ridiculous that even the Elders of St. Gile's should alter the historical appearance of St. Gile's without somebody being able at least to supervise and, if necessary, to interfere, but I agree with the Minister that this is a point that must be considered beyond this Bill, and is really a matter of fundamental policy for the whole country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two churches in the middle of the Strand which may soon become unoccupied and unused, and a problem may arise as to what is to be their disposal. This is a question which is arising all over the country. There are churches in Edinburgh which are now used as warehouses. The buildings are preserved, but the question is, that there would be power under planning to prevent the alteration of the building of the churches. I think that this is a question that ought to be considered, but I doubt whether this is the right place to do it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the right hon. Gentleman explain why this is not the right place to do it? This seems to me to be a wonderful opportunity. Here we are with a planning Bill, and I really cannot see why we should not consider this in a planning Bill, because it is a planning matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the noble Lord said, all these Bills and different Acts are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1079">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>481</span>
a jigsaw puzzle, and it would be quite wrong to alter one till all the repercussions have been considered with regard to the others. For instance, if we are proposing to interfere, we immediately raise the question how far we are going to bear the cost to the people of our interference. Under the Historic Buildings Council legislation it is forbidden to give grants to what are called ecclesiastical properties, or churches which are still in use for religious purposes. If they are not in use for religious purposes they may be assisted. Therefore, of course, if we alter things by this Bill we immediately have repercussions on Acts of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the noble Lord should leave it at the moment and pass it on to the Minister so that this may be considered, because, if it is a problem, it has not arisen yet. If it is a problem that does arise, then of course it would be considered urgently, but it certainly is a problem that might be considered by the Government with regard to this whole question of churches which are becoming obsolete, and will always, obviously, have to have a change of use or be demolished, in which case some very important buildings may go out of existence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I simply rise to put this point to my hon. Friend. I know, of course, the convent in Drummond Place to which the noble Lord has referred, and one does ask the question—suppose they decided to alter the shape of the windows, lengthen the shape of the windows, or make special-shaped windows for the convent, which might be quite a good idea from the point of view of those administering it, how would that fit in with the architectural pattern of Drummond Place? The point that I really wanted to make was this, that very often, and I think that this is true in Edinburgh and in the New Town, the church actually forms part of the planning of the area. The importance of the church in Charlotte Square is that it is at the end of Queen Street, in the same way as the Royal Bank Building is at the other end. But it adds; it gives a finish; it is part of the architectural scene from George Street. There are a number of other churches in the New Town of Edinburgh in the noble Lord's constituency, in which
	<span class='label label-info column'>482</span>
this is true. They are actually part of the architectural scene, the beauty of a particular view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One has seen this done, too, in the noble Lord's constituency. Suppose, for instance, they decided to cut off the steeple of the church. I think that they did this to the church in Albany Street, Grosvenor Street, at the end there. I am not saying that that either adds or detracts from that particular value, but suppose that they decided to make an architectural change of that character, surely they are, in the case of the churches I was considering, changing the view, changing the particular architectural aspect of that area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This does seem to me to be a matter of importance. Whilst I recognise the difficulties mentioned by my hon. Friend it does seem that it is worthy of some consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that in this question of churches we have raised a fairly important matter. I do not intend to enter into the theological arguments of my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith) but I must say, with my knowledge of Churches, that I must support the Minister of State, in that at least the Churches do want to maintain their own jurisdiction in these matters, where the churches are continuing to be used for ecclesiastical purposes. Perhaps he would confirm that within the Churches there are very substantial built-in safeguards to ensure that architectural changes do not occur in the churches unless they are proved to be in character and for good purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know myself that in the Church of Scotland—the Minister of State will, perhaps, guide the Committee on this, no kirk session can alter the architecture, or carry out any alterations in its church without the permission of the presbytery. I think that this is correct certainly so far as the Church of Scotland is concerned. The Church of Scotland is also extremely well advised by its architects, and so forth, and very careful and very conscious of its public responsibilities, as well as its responsibilities within the Church. I know from experience that this is a position within the Church of Scotland, which, of course, covers the vast majority of churches in Scotland. Certainly in my own local church we have carried out
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1080">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>483</span>
alterations, but there are safeguards to preserve the character of the church in any alterations that take place. I know that we have these safeguards in the Church of Scotland, which the Minister mentioned himself, but he may be able to enlarge on these and show to the Committee how effective these safeguards are. I would be interested to know what safeguards do exist for other denominations as well. I think that this is a necessary and important point, because, after all, the Church of Scotland is one of the most democratically organised denominations in Scotland, and it has all these safeguards. I would be interested to know what safeguards the other denominations have in order to ensure that their responsibilities, not only within themselves but to the community as a whole, are fulfilled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Dempsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like the Minister, when he is replying, to give us some information as to whether there is any evidence within the country of neglect by the Church authorities along the lines speculated upon by the noble Lord the Member for Edinburgh, North (Earl of Dalkeith). The reason why I am asking this is that I have had quite a bit of experience dealing with Church problems in all my public life, and I have found that when they want nothing but the best it sometimes means spending too much on improving churches and improving the architecture and improving the presentation to the people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would seem from the speeches we have been listening to that there is some apprehension that Church buildings might be physically altered in a fashion which would injure the amenity of an area. This is the point that has been made. I have not had this experience. In the whole of Lanarkshire, I think, the converse is the case; any time alterations have been made—and sometimes the cost has been pretty stiff—the Church people have actually subjected themselves to finding the necessary monetary resources to make improvements worthy of the nature of the areas, the communities, and indeed of the Church as an organisation itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be very interesting if the Minister of State could say whether this particular argument arises out of some complaints or some unfortunate experi-
	<span class='label label-info column'>484</span>
ence we have had in some part of the country. I certainly would like to know. I should also like to hear him say whether, if it is not the case that they may not be subject to planning control, they are still subject to building bylaw control. No local authority will give any approval to any establishment, no matter what it may be, unless the alterations, adaptations or remodelling are based on the bylaws. I certainly know we have to have planning, and building bylaws.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been my experience, in bringing about alterations to property, in spite of the fact that they are not obliged to do so, Church authorities do consult the appropriate officers of the local authorities for advice and assistance before they decide the design of the proposed alterations. I honestly believe that any Church in Scotland, any denomination, has a sense of responsibility and will consult with the powers that be. I remember in my own local authority area finding alongside the Sacred Heart school a site for the Plymouth Brethren. It is a very small religious sect, but a very genuine sect, and even they consulted the appropriate officers of the local authority, whether they were expected to do so or not, before they considered any design for the building. It is my experience that at the present time, when the older churches are being left in the older parts of the towns and the cities, while the peripheral community move into new churches, that the Church authorities are faced with the problem of remodelling the older churches, and in any instances with which I have had any experience, they have always consulted the local planning authority, the local building bylaws, all the planning and building interests concerned, before they proceeded with the remodelling of an older building. This does speak highly of this sense of purpose, of this sense of responsibility, of this sense of undertaking to the rest of the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do hope that when my hon. Friend comes to reply he will give us some information as to whether there is any reason to be apprehensive as to what the Churches will be doing in the future, when they have lived up to such a high standard of understanding, responsibility and presentation in the past.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly subscribe to what my hon. Friend the Member for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1081">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>485</span>
Coatbridge and Airdrie (Mr. Dempsey) has just said, that the record of the Churches, and by that I mean most of the Churches if not all the Churches, is very good.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must say my breath was slightly taken away by the hon. Gentleman the Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith) when he made the remark about "the Church would take a different view from the rest of us of art and architecture". I agree with that, because those who have been looking at Sir Kenneth Clark's series on BBC 2 know that the Church has taken a different view of society, a much healthier view of society, whatever that society was in the last two thousand years; and most of what we are preserving in western Europe of architecture if not directly in the form of churches, has in fact been sponsored by the Church. So that in fact the Church has an excellent record, both in the preceding centuries and this century, of building and of fine architecture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For what hypothetical reason a church congregation, however the church is governed—and the hon. Gentleman the Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) must not tempt me into a discussion on the different forms of church government: this is a difficult enough Clause without that-whatever the forms of popular control in a church the fact is that a church would have to have a good reason for wanting to do some of the things that have been mentioned today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be the case, for example, that a church will not apply for a grant to the Secretary of State. It might get a grant, but it is the practice not to give grants. The spire, for example, may be in danger, the church congregation may wish to take down the spire. The Secretary of State might volunteer to offer a grant for this purpose, to preserve the spire, and I would imagine that popularly locally, quite apart from in the church, there could be a demand that the spire be repaired.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does that mean that the Secretary of State is in a position to give grants? I thought the Minister first of all said that it was impossible to give grants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>486</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. What I did say was that in Statute we are not debarred from giving grants but in practice the Secretary of State has never given grants. That is the office of Secretary of State. I think that the Churches themselves have some doubts, anyway, as to whether or not they should come into this grant awarding arena, because it means that the State would then start to argue with them about the adaptation of buildings which they may argue are within their own preserve. After all there are many ceremonies in the Church which involve the shape of vessels and structures and windows and so on which are considered by the Church to be part of its worship. The State cannot come in and say, "This is not artistically right", or, "You must not change that". This is what the Church, I think, is afraid of, that the State will dictate the form of architecture and structure, because it looks better to the citizenry rather than because it looks right to the worshippers. This is the essential point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) ask the 64,000 dollar question, "When is a church a church"? The answer is, "When the courts so decide it". We had an argument once as to what was a minister of religion, and the courts had to decide whether in their view preachers of certain denominations like Jehovah's Witnesses for example, were ministers. This is not for us to decide in this Committee. This is for the courts to decide, whether a church is a church.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we are discussing is not the listing of buildings which the Church has. We do that already, and that will not change. We are listing the building as it is. But we do not have them subject to listed control, which is the subject of this Amendment. The only time we control churches is when they move out of use as churches. For example, the Park Church is now listed and controlled because it is no longer used by the Church. But we could never do that while Park Church was a place of worship. We cannot decide when a place of worship ceases to be a place of worship. Only the Church can do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put it to the noble Lord, that while this has been a very interesting debate I think it would be wrong of us in this Bill to seek to make any change, and I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1082">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>487</span>
come back to my original point. I think if there is to be change, the change should be asked by the Church, not asked by a Government of the Churches. I think the Churches themselves with their immense responsibility can discharge this, but if they feel that the State ought to come in and help them, then they should discuss this, but there are very serious problems of control here. We must not disguise them. Remember, it is not only control by the Secretary of State, but of the local council on what the Church would be doing with its building.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put it to the noble Lord that, while we have had a useful debate, it would really be wrong of us in this relatively short way to try and dispose of a very substantial principle which has been in planning law now for 22 years, and that we cannot just dispose of it like that, without having much deeper and thorough consultation with the Churches of all faiths, not just necessarily of the faith to which we personally individually may subscribe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Gentleman's suggestion. I do not know. The whole purpose of my Amendment was simply to try and provoke discussion of this point mainly in connection with quite ordinary buildings which are used for ecclesiastical purposes. The trouble lies in the definition of what is an ecclesiastical building and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) very rightly pointed out, the Scientologists no doubt would be classified as being a recognised religion—I have no idea—but were they to be recognised as such, there is nothing to stop them from buying a house in, say, the centre of Charlotte Square and doing anything they may want to with it, provided that they are going to give some indication that they will use it for ecclesiastical purposes—if that is the right word thereafter.

I hope that perhaps this debate will have caused those within the Government to think about some of these problems, particularly in relation to definition and, in the hope that this is so, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The double negative is absolutely essential here. A grant of planning permission could not, as a condition or otherwise, require listed building consent. The simple point is that, except as expressly provided for in the Clause, planning permission does not relieve the applicant of the necessity to obtain listed building

It seemed to me, when I was going through this Bill and burning a good deal of midnight oil during a late Sitting on the Post Office Bill, that there was an important omission here. Having searched through the English Measure and found no reference to this point, which rather surprised me, it does seem to me that this is something which might be a useful addition to the Bill. I think it is fairly self-explanatory. After all, we were faced with this problem only in January of last year, and I think it must be something which deserves consideration.

Perhaps I shall not be thanked by those who find their insurance premiums going up as a result of our putting this forward, but I think it is a necessary and useful Amendment, and I therefore hope the Minister gives it some favourable consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Of course, there are other matters—lightning, explosion, flooding, acts of God of different kinds, and so on—and I think that, if we are going to make this Amendment in principle, we ought to do it in the form of a new subsection and I would therefore suggest that I try to do that on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>COMPENSATION FOR REFUSAL OF CONSENT TO ALTERATIONS ETC.</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 171, in page 42, line 24, leave out paragraph (	<i>a</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This concerns compensation on subsequent applications, and the purpose of it is to seek clarification of what this paragraph (	<i>a</i>) means. It would appear to me that it could mean that if a man were refused an application to alter his house and was consequently compensated for the refusal, and then he sold his house to somebody else who did exactly the same thing and submitted the same sort of application, he would then be treated in the same way. He might then next year sell the house to somebody who did the same thing, so we would have somebody permanently dishing out compensation. But it could well be that I have totally misread and misunderstood this paragraph.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have had several goes at this, trying to understand the point which the noble Lord is making. I have no further assistance at all from my advisers to help me to explain the matter better. This is simply a compensation provision in its normal form, which we have had for some time, and of which no one has made any complaint. I do not quite follow the noble Lord's illustration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph (	<i>a</i>), as it stands, provides that, in assessing a claim for compensation arising out of a refusal or conditional grant of listed building consent, it is to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1084">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>491</span>
be assumed that any subsequent application for consent would be treated in the same way. In other words, the refusal or restriction is assumed to be perpetual. This is the method we adopted in Section 18 of the 1947 Act to assess depreciation due to refusal of planning consent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have undertaken in private conversation with the noble Lord to look into this again. I think that it should be on all fours with listed building consent. I do not see the distinction. If he likes to have another go, I shall see if I can give a better reply. But at the moment it seems to me that both should be on all fours with each other, and that is right in equity. I know of no other system, and cannot comment on the example given by the noble Lord because I do not see the point in the example.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Probably the best thing would be for me to consult my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) at some time in the future and see if he is able to give me a fairly good translation of what it all means; and leave it at that for the time being, rather than waste the time of the Committee on it. I shall certainly read with interest what the Minister has said. I hope that this will improve my understanding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>NOTICE TO ENFORCE S. 39 CONTROL</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 172, in page 42, line 39, after 'been', insert 'since the passing of this Act'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As this sentence in Clause 43 now reads, it says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where it appears to the local planning authority that any works have been, or are being, executed to a listed building in their area …"</p></blockquote>
Then all kinds of tough provisions follow therefrom. It seemed to me that this was
	<span class='label label-info column'>492</span>
a rather openended way of phrasing it. In fact, it could be interpreted retrospectively. I am not a lawyer, but it seems to me that this could be interpreted as being an important omission; it could introduce an element of retrospection lasting back any length of time. For instance, the ancestors of my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith) may have added Victorian gables to a nice old house 100 years ago, and, under this, I should have thought as a lawyer read it, the local authority or the Secretary of State could come along and demand that he should take them off at his expense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder whether there is any logical reason why we should not have these words inserted, to make it absolutely clear to lawyers who are interpreting the Bill that it does not intend that there should be any element of retrospection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can understand the noble Lord's fears about retrospection. Retrospection occurs only when it is expressly provided for, or there is a necessary implication that that was intended. It is well-established legally that there is no retrospection otherwise, unless decisions of the court decide this. Our intention here is that no contravention of Clause 39(2) and (6) could arise till the provisions are brought into force by a commencement order; and no commencement order is valid till this Bill is passed and made an Act. To that extent, I hope that the hon. Gentleman accepts from me that there is no question of retrospection beyond this when the Bill becomes an Act. With that assurance, I hope that he will accept the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall consult my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie), again, about this point. If he considers that I have been chasing a false hare here, I shall not pursue the matter at any later stage of the Bill; but if he does not ease my misgivings, I may try to bring it up in some other way later on. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This could possibly be an important addition—the insertion of the word "reasonable"—in relation to the penalties which come later on in Clause 44.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the point. The Amendment is unnecessary in this regard: we have reference to it in Schedule 4, paragraph 17(1)(	<i>g</i>), where a right of appeal is allowed against the notice on the grounds that the period is unreasonably short. So, while it is a very good point, I do not think we have to make this Amendment. It is in Schedule 4.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Two very brief points. First, it occurs to me that the provisions of this Clause could possibly conflict with building regulations, which may require certain things to be done to a house. For instance, it might be necessary under building regulations, if
	<span class='label label-info column'>494</span>
any changes had been made inside a house, to enlarge the size of the windows so that they conform with the square footage of the windows squaring up with area of floor space. I am not quite sure what the Government's approach to this matter is, but I think it draws attention to the slight difficulties into which we fall with overlapping legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point is whether this Clause would cover the scrubbing and washing of the stonework of a dirty house. After all, we have quite a lot of fairly grubby houses in Edinburgh, and, while the scrubbing and washing of a dirty house may be highly desirable in so far as that individual house is concerned, it may not be a particularly good thing in the context of the street as a whole. I should be interested to know whether this Clause provides the necessary control for this kind of thing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The position of listed buildings is safeguarded in the Buildings (Scotland) Act. With regard to the last point, I think that this is really a matter for the public health authorities, rather than a planning matter—the state of cleanliness of a house. It is assumed that all matters of a sanitary nature will be kept under control in that way. I do not quite follow the noble Lord's point if it is beyond that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The washing down of the National Gallery and Royal Academy, for instance, may be an admirably good thing to do for the individual buildings, but it may be the wrong thing to do if one just does one house by itself, without doing all its neighbours. Otherwise, it might make all the rest of the street look worse than it did to start with.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
