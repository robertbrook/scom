	<p>4.0 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. I wonder, Mr. Brewis, if you would help the Committee by telling us what you have in mind regarding breaks between now and breakfast time tomorrow morning?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had intended allowing a reasonable interval for dinner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we adjourned with some relief at One o'clock I was questioning whether a listed building enforcement notice could be served in respect of someone who washed the stonework of his house because, however correct he may have been in doing this for his own house it could possibly ruin the look of the entire street, unless there were some agreed policy whereby the occupiers of all the houses, of which his formed merely part of the group, were doing the same thing at roughly the same time. I do not know whether washing the stonework is, in fact, covered by this Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Dr. J. Dickson Mabon)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I referred to the first point made by the noble Lord before his present intervention, which he has just completed. I would like to amplify that, that the reference to the Building (Scotland) Act, 1959, which I made, is Section 17(2), paragraph 56 of Schedule 8 to this Bill—that is as read.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With reference to the last point the noble Lord has raised about washing
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>498</span>
buildings, I am afraid that there is no planning control on this matter at the present time. It is very difficult to say to anyone that he cannot proceed with the cleaning of his building, because, as many of us know, and have had experience with Government buildings, actually cleaning them is a form of preservative, and one can hardly stop someone from preserving it. What I would suggest is that really the right way of tackling this is for someone who is engaged on this, where others may object, is to seek the consent of the others to do the whole thing as one, rather than to do it in a patchwork of cleaned and uncleaned buildings and thereby, of course, spoiling the whole appearance of the terrace, or whatever it may be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is all I can suggest to the noble Lord, that at the present moment we do not have it covered by planning. It would be wrong of us to proceed to refuse people the right to clean and preserve their own buildings. I do not know whether we should take the opposite power. I would have to think about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is this not perhaps a good example of where street societies could be very valuable, because, clearly, this is something which calls for collective action by all those who live in a particular area? I would have thought that anything we could do to encourage the formation of street societies and encourage their being active and energetic and helpful, such as the Northumberland Street Society would probably be a very useful thing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Dickson Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I agree.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Clause ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>

	<div class='title'>EXECUTION AND COST OF WORKS REQUIRED UNDER ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURE</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 47, in page 43, line 44, after 'owner', insert 'or lessee'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of this Amendment, together with Amendments No. 48 and 49,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1090">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>499</span>
is to enable a local planning authority to recover the expenses from the lessee of a building, where appropriate, instead of from the owner or occupier. The Clause, as the Committee realises, empowers the local planning authority to enter on the land and execute any works required by a listed building enforcement notice under Clause 41, which we have just discussed, and to recover any expenses reasonably incurred in doing so. This Amendment, of course, brings in the lessee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should just like to make the comment that this seems to be a most necessary Clause by ensuring fair play in order to redress the suffering which could be caused by Clause 47. So far as I can see, the claimant for compensation might have to resort to fairly costly litigation in order to secure his redress and, reading this Clause, I am not at all sure whether the legal costs could be included in the compensation settlement. I do not know whether that is a question which the Minister will be able to answer off the cuff but, if not,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>500</span>
perhaps he could either write to me or take any necessary steps that may be required at later stages of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must confess that, without notice of that question, I could not give an absolute assurance about this. Some of the advice given to me is that perhaps it would, but I would not like to be quite definitive about that. If the noble Lord will leave it, I will try to make a statement some time later in the Bill's proceedings about it, because I am sure we must be accurate about these matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Clause ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
</section>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 49</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>COMPULSORY ACQUISITION OF LISTED BUILDING IN NEED OF REPAIR</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Amendment made, No. 119</i>: In page 47, line 5, leave out 'Minister of Public Building and Works' and insert 'Secretary of State'.—[	<i>Dr. Dickson Mabon.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 180, in page 47, line 33, at end add:
	<br><q><p>(7) A person aggrieved by a decision of the sheriff on an application under subsection (6) above may appeal against the decision to the Court of Session.</p></q>
This concerns the right of appeal to the Court of Session for an aggrieved person, and this seems to me to be a very important Amendment to cover an omission which, I think, may have occurred accidentally. When one considers that compulsory acquisition does impose much more savage treatment than the minimum compensation Clause, which does allow one to appeal to the Court of Session, it seems odd that this has been left out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, the English Act, as a point of principle, does allow for such an appeal to the Court in Section 50(7). I am all for being tough in this Bill, as it is indeed being tough. But if we are going to be tough, it is all the more essential that we should be completely certain that we are being scrupulously fair about appeals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the noble Lord for drawing our attention by his Amendment to our not having made
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1091">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>501</span>
a distinction here between the provisions. This Amendment would bring Clause 49 in line with Clause 2(6). I do not accept the drafting of the Amendment. I will not go into reasons. I do not expect the noble Lord to be any more expert at drafting Amendments unassisted than I am. However, in principle this is a good point. I will willingly make an Amendment of this character at Report stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to Amendment 184 which is being taken with this one, the noble Lord will agree that it is right and proper that there should be a right of appeal to the Court of Session. These appeals should be on questions of law and not on facts as well as law, thereby securing a second hearing of the facts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am prepared to accept Amendment 180 in principle, but I could not recommend the Committee to accept Amendment 184.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. N. R. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are not all appeals to the Court of Session from a lower court on points of law?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would think so. On the other hand, if we were to remove this, there would be dubiety in the Statute. It could be argued for a second hearing of the facts as well as the law. I welcome the hon. and learned Gentleman back home again. We have missed him, as has his noble Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister's acceptance of the principle of the Amendment. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. G. D. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The effectiveness of this Clause will depend on there being sufficient money to pay for the compulsory acquisition of the buildings. If the local authority has insufficient money, it may dither as to whether or not it should compulsorily acquire the building. I should, perhaps, have raised this point when we discussed the Motion, That Clause 42 stand part of the Bill, where there is the question of who is to pay the compensation for refusal of consent to alterations. The hon. Gentleman told us about the difficulties with regard to statutory listing and he overcame that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>502</span>
difficulty by provisional listing. The listing ought to be all right from now on. However, he has not dwelt upon the financial aspect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our deliberations this morning he paid a tribute to Glasgow. I assume that he is aware of the doubts which Glasgow has had on this Clause. It has circulated a memorandum which probably expresses the views of many local authorities. It is quite short:
	<br><q><p>"The Corporation agree on the advantages of preserving buildings. These are part of the nation's heritage, but their selection must be a matter of judgment and the retention of any building must be weighed against the cost of so doing and the social advantages of developments which would require their removal. If this is so then surely a local authority, which is under the direction of the Secretary of State to preserve buildings which they wish to remove should be able to look to the Central Department for financial assistance. The costs to be borne by a local authority can be very substantial indeed. The Corporation therefore feel that grant should be made in these circumstances."</p></q>
I would go further. Unless there is some financial arrangement, all our hopes in this Clause of this Bill may well be frustrated. I would be most grateful if the Minister could just say a few words setting at rest by doubts on the financial implications of compulsory purchase under this Clause, and also refusal of consent to alterations under Clause 42.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the point made by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith) that without finance there are limits to what can be done in this regard. This applies to the State as well. There is a limit to what the taxpayer can be asked to pay, and what the Exchequer can offer in this regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present situation is that for rate support grant the reckonable expenditure of the authority can include expenditure which involves compulsory purchase. The hon. Gentleman is right in that there is no direct grant as such with these particular orders. I would tend to agree with the Corporation's view that it should look to the central Government for some form of assistance. The hon. Gentleman has asked for a grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the question of money comes into putting this Statute into practice, we are not dealing specifically in this Bill with money. We shall have to provide the powers to the local planning authorities and the Secretary of State. Exercise
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1092">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>503</span>
of these powers is shared between them, depending on the circumstances at the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will not go into classical cases. This morning, my right hon. Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn) indicated the problem of the Tron Church. That is a complicated matter. It did not happen in my time, but the right hon. Gentleman probably remembers this better since he was there at the time. That caused considerable expense to Edinburgh Corporation. I am not saying whether it was a justifiable expense or not, but it put the Corporation in a difficult position. We have since tried to clarify the legal position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the general criticism on the point regarding financial considerations. We shall have to look at it closely. At the moment, this is not a money Bill. This is essentially a Bill on the distribution of power between the Secretary of State and the local planning authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a local planning authority is not using its discretion, but following the discretion of the central Department, there is a stronger case for the authority asking the central Department for a direct grant or a larger share of the costs. I accept that. It is a fair argument. However, if the discretion is of a wider nature for the local authority, where it is deciding whether to preserve this building as distinct from that building, without the Secretary of State's being involved, then it is a fair argument to say that the local authority ought to pay a less small proportion of the purchase of this than would be the case were the central Government intervening, with all the paraphernalia of power that we have in this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry I cannot give a more substantial answer than that. I cannot go into the figures this time. I accept that we should be giving more money. We are giving more money in respect of this. Perhaps in later years we shall be able to look at this more favourably and see whether we can follow along these lines.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Clause, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>504</span>
</section>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 50</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>REPAIRS NOTICE AS PRELIMINARY TO COMPULSORY ACQUISITION</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment 181, in page 47, line 36, leave out 'two' and insert 'six'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This brings us to the question of a repairs notice as a preliminary to compulsory acquisition. As it now reads, we find
	<br><q><p>"Neither a local planning authority nor the Secretary of State shall start the compulsory purchase of a building under section 49 above unless at least two months previously they have served on the owner of the building, and not withdrawn, a notice under this section (referred to in this section as a 'repairs notice')—"</p></q>
This is too short a time, and coupled with the aim of wanting to be still more fair, if we are to get tougher, I would ask the Minister if he could give the Amendment his sympathetic consideration. The victim could be going abroad, out of the country, for perhaps three months, doing valuable exporting—cattle to the Argentine or some such. In view of the significant implications of this Clause, I would suggest that six months should be an absolute minimum. This would not do anything to undermine the provisions of the Clause, but it would help to ensure fair play, and we would be seen to be legislating fairly</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As it stands, the Clause provides that the repairs notice must be served at least two months before compulsory purchase proceedings are started. This period, we think, is quite adequate. After all, the compulsory purchase procedures provide very full opportunity for the owners to object. The purpose of the Clause is quite simply to give the owner a reasonable opportunity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the hon. Gentleman's point that two months might in certain cases be too short, particularly for the roving exporter who is away for six months at a time, but may I counsel the noble Lord to advise his constituent who exports for six months abroad that he really ought to give power of attorney to somebody—to his wife or to his lawyer or to somebody. He must give them the power to act, because there are in law lots of things of which he will get notice of less
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1093">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>505</span>
than six months affecting his property, and he really ought to be prudent, so that these matters can be dealt with in the right way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would not like to go to six months. I have thought about this since last night, and would not like to go to anything more than two months, because we really ought to have these matters settled as quickly as possible. After all, this is to give the owner a reasonable opportunity of satisfying the authority. If the authority says, "All right, it may take longer than that", at least it is within that two months that the authority is asking for that assurance, so I do not think that unreasonable in the circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did, of course, refer to the chap who is going abroad for three months, not six months, but it is possible that he may be away for only just under two months, and comes home to find himself presented with the next stage of the procedure, which is the compulsory acquisition procedure, without having had much time to do anything about it in between whiles. I think that if we are to show that we are being fair as well as being tough we ought to press this point, unless the Minister is prepared to think about it a little more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must admit I am not terribly convinced by what the Minister has said. Property is something special, and one does not necessarily give a power of attorney when dealing with one's property. One will perhaps do that when dealing with accounts, banks and things like that. Particularly, as my noble Friend has said, if one expects to be away for six weeks, one does not give a power of attorney for dealing with one's property. One comes back, one has hardly had time to look into one's letters, and one sees that the period is nearly up. I do think that the Minister might consider this again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why has he chosen two months? It seems a funny period to choose. Why two months? Three, or six; or a year they fit in. But why two months? I do think it is a little short, and I do not believe the longer time would diminish the effectiveness of the Clause, but it would give, I think, a little bit of extra fairness. I do hope that the Minister may be able to meet us, or at least to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>506</span>
say—it is a long brief he has to read—that perhaps he might reconsider it on Report. That would satisfy us, if he could do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have gone over the time intervals in the whole of Clause 50, after I had the advantage, if the noble Lord will forgive me for referring again to the discussion I had with him last night about it. If one looks at them together, they really chime in reasonably well, and certainly compare with those in other Statutes. If it is the wish of the Committee that I should look at two months again, I am prepared to do so—but without commitment. I do not want to commit myself to anything less.

	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 182, in page 48, line 11, at end insert:
	<br><q><p>'a repairs notice shall be deemed to have lapsed automatically at the end of a period of two years from the date on which it was served providing no action has been taken to withdraw it or to pursue it by means of compulsory acquisition'.</p></q>
I say to start with that there is nothing particularly magical about the period of two years; there is no reason why I should not have suggested one year or three years. It would seem to me that unless we do insert some provision whereby a repairs notice does automatically lapse, it will mean that the sword of Damocles, the threat of compusory acquisition, will hang over somebody for ever, if it is not withdrawn or implemented. It would make life really quite intolerable for the person living in a house, particularly if it is an old house and rather crumbly and constantly in need of repairs of some kind or another. I believe this is quite an important point which should be treated reasonably seriously. A repairs notice could even perhaps, include such matters as the painting of woodwork and windows, and it might just so happen that the year in which the owner had budgeted to do this kind of work might not conform to the views of the local authority. There may be all kinds of reasons why the two might not match up, and yet it would be possible for the local authority to step in and use fairly forceful powers which could

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>507</span>
dangle on for ever more. I hope perhaps the Minister will consider this with some sympathy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sympathetic to the point which the hon. Gentleman is putting forward, namely, that it would be wrong for ever to have hanging over an owner's head the threat of compulsory purchase proceedings. I see that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the owner carries out the repairs specified in the repair notice that is those considered by the local planning authority proper for the presentation of the building, then the authority of course, has no grounds for proceeding to compulsory purchase, and the owner in that case, even though no time limit was specified in the Act, would have nothing to fear, because the authority could not succeed in pressing against him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other cases, where the issue of the repair notice is generally followed, as it will be, with negotiations between the owner and the authority, they are bound to take some time, and even if there were a time put in, all the authority would have to do would be to renew the notice, so that we do not get out of the predicament, we do not get out of the situation, where an authority is determined to keep this state of indecision going on for some time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, it may be that the authority quite genuinely feels that the negotiations are taking too long, that they should be resolved, and that it is the owner who is being difficult. That may be the position. But it does not solve anything—I have thought about this—to put in one year, two years or three years as a time limit, because all the authority has then to do to circumvent that is to issue a new notice, and so we are back where we started.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do think the right way of doing it, of course, is for the authority and the owner to seek to come together as quickly as they can and get these negotiations successfully concluded. Alternatively, as I said at the beginning, if the repairs notice is dealt with properly then of course the owner has absolutely nothing to fear, because there are no grounds
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>508</span>
which can be used against him for proceeding wiht a compulsory purchase order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister, I think, has really added to my argument, because he says that if we did have a time limit of one year, two years or three years, if one reached the end of that period, then there would be nothing to stop the local authority from renewing the notice if it were so required. I would have suggested that it is right that the authority should take positive action, rather than issue a notice and then stuff it in a pigeonhole where it is forgotten, and the wretched chap living in the house does not know whether somebody is peering at him all the time to see whether his gutters are falling off, or whether the paint is peeling off his door, or what have you. I think it is right that the local authority should be required to take positive action if it wants the repairs notice to continue, rather than just letting it sit in the pigeonhole and frighten the chap, and give him a really rather horrible life.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. A. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must say, if I understood the noble Lord correctly, that he seems to be imagining some case which is never likely to take place. If the notice is never given effect, then I cannot see that anyone will worry about it; if he worries about it, he will make the repairs. If he is not worrying about it, he will forget about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But it seems to me to be incredible that the local authority would issue a notice of this kind with no intention of following it up. I could imagine all sorts of cases that could possibly happen, but I must say that he has not convinced me that this is at all likely to happen. It seems to be a mistake to put in a whole lot of Clauses into Bills to cater for improbable cases which will probably never arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to disagree with my right hon. Friend the Member for East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn). I rather agree with the noble Lord, because it seems to me that at least we ought to take steps to protect the individual against the shilly-shallying of a local authority. After all, a private person has some rights—or at least, he ought to have. I can quite easily visualise circumstances in which a local authority, purely for its
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1095">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>509</span>
own purposes shilly-shallies over compulsorily acquiring something. It does not want to spend the money in that financial year, and that is a very good argument for a local authority; therefore, it shilly-shallies along. Whilst it is true, as my hon. Friend says, that in any case it can just renew the notice, nevertheless, if it had to notify the owner, that would at least remind it that Parliament, when it passed this Bill, did in fact expect it to get on with the job that it had undertaken to do, and not to put the person concerned to too great an inconvenience. I take it that this is what this Committee would wish, that we should let it be known that we expect local authorities to act promptly in these cases. I cannot see anything wrong with the Amendment. To me it does not seem to matter all that amount, except that it does give this indication. I should have thought it quite a good indication to give to a local authority. It does not affect it to any extent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take my right hon. Friend's point, namely, that what Parliament intends is that the negotiations should be settled and the repairs done. That is the point that my right hon. Friend was trying to make, too. I will undertake that in the circular which we send out about this we will remind local authorities about this Clause, and say that we should like these negotiations to be concluded amicably and as quickly as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I am trying to argue against the Amendment is that the Amendment would not achieve that. The noble Lord and I have been arguing, in a sense, from two different premises. My premise is that the owner should want to settle quickly and he should, therefore, try to get the matter concluded with the local authority. The noble Lord's premise is saying that the local authority is being very difficult, it is shilly-shallying and not coming to the point—my right hon. Friend used these words—and that it is dangling this man along. If I may say so, if this Amendment were put in, it could still dangle him. I cannot see what profit it would give the local authority to see this house constantly lying there unrepaired. I do not see what joy that is to it, to simply dangle this man along, when all it has to do at the end of the time limit is to re-issue the notice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is worse, I agree. I do not want my hon. and learned Friend to come over to my side, because I think that we might get the noble Lord to withdraw this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I hope the hon. Gentleman does not think that I am supporting him. I am just listening to the argument, and I look forward to coming in at a later stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, I withdraw that welcome home. The hon. and learned Gentleman does not know if there is a green card circulating for him urgently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I was trying to argue is that I do not think that this is a way of getting out of it. I have given the undertaking to put a reference in the circular, so that we will not have this going on for some considerable time, and to express our disapproval of this kind of manoeuvre, which I regard as a shoddy one by a local authority, and that, if there should be a genuine attempt by both sides to come together and settle it, that is the intention of Parliament. We shall make that clear in a circular. I hope that, with that undertaking, the hon. Gentleman will not seek to press his Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my noble Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North (Earl of Dalkeith) on raising this matter, because it seems to me, as to the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis), that there is something in it. After all, the local authority has a public duty here. If it sees a building falling into disrepair, it has a duty to acquire it. It has a duty to give warning by means of a repair notice that, if the obligations set out in the repairs notice are not met, this is what will happen. Surely it is better from everyone's point of view for all to know exactly where they stand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the local authority has this statutory duty to do something about it if the owner does not, and if the owner is given a warning to do something about it within a statutory period and does nothing about it, is it not better that he should be told in the notice that unless he does this, the local authority will acquire the property by compulsory purchase? That would get over the business of dangling notices one after the other.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1096">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>511</span>
It would be an abuse of statutory powers for an authority to serve a repairs notice, let the time run out, and then just keep on serving repairs notices. That could not possibly be a satisfactory state of affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would it not be much better if it were made perfectly clear that this is what the local authority in its wisdom thinks ought to be done with the property and, if it is not done, it will have to acquire it? It may be that a Home Department circular could deal with this just as well, but one would want to know exactly where one stood. It is not desirable for people to be sitting with repairs notices and nothing following on them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With his greater knowledge of the law, would the hon. and learned Gentleman say, if this were passed, would not the terms of the notice be to the tenor that these repairs must be done and, if they are not done, this notice will lapse after two years?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the notice has to specify, as far as Clause 50(1) is concerned, is the works which the local authority thinks are necessary. It goes on to explain the effects of Clauses 49 to 52 of this Bill. If the local authority does not make up its mind to act on it, then nothing happens. One wants a repairs notice to have some sanction behind it. My noble Friend is suggesting that it should lapse after two years. He is focussing attention on a defect in the provisions. I would say that the proper way to go about this is to give notice that, if the repairs are not done within the statutory period, then the local authority will acquire and do it itself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not what the Amendment is proposing, and that is what we are debating at the moment—the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To come back to the point made by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith), a local authority may not be in a position to acquire the property compulsorily. It may have taken on rather a heavy load of compulsory purchase in that particular year, and may want to leave it over to the following year, although it may have given a repairs notice. This may be the reason why. I cannot understand why it would want to go on for ever, dangling a repairs notice,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>512</span>
but if this is what the noble Lord feels might happen—and he wants two years written in—it means that a repairs notice, after two years, fails. If the authority is still dangling it on after two years, all it will have to do is to issue another one. This is the point I am trying to make. So the Amendment, in fact, secures nothing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we take the hon. and learned Gentleman's point, which is a different one and not strictly confined to this Amendment, the Amendment he should make to this Bill would say that the minute a repairs notice expires, the local authority must have a compulsory purchase order. That would be quite unworkable for financial reasons, for reasons of the office—it may be that the administrative burden on the town clerk's office may be such that he does not want to do that. Therefore, what will happen is that one will then have the repairs not done because the authority is frightened to issue a repairs order in case it is immediately landed with a compulsory purchase notice automatically. That would not be what we want.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the local authority in the position, if it serves a repairs notice at all, of having a request to purchase served under Clause 50(4), which it would have to comply with unless there were good reason not to. It may be obliged under other provisions to acquire the property whether in a financial position to or not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is very true, but in that case it may have good reasons why it does not want to proceed. That is why we put that provision in voluntarily—not had it put to us by hon. Gentlemen opposite, but of our own accord put this in. That is quite true.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, to go back to what we are talking about here, I am not talking about a hypothetical Amendment which is not on the Paper, which is what I have been tempted to do so far. What I am trying to say is that this Amendment does not secure its purpose even if its purpose were legitimate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I think its purpose ought to be is, that the time of negotiation between a local authority and the person concerned ought to be as short as possible and the repairs ought to be done. The only way of doing that with effect is to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1097">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>513</span>
remind the local authority of this obligation to keep pressing this matter rather than to leave it over indefinitely for some time. That meets the noble Lord's point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a little happier than I was. I think that what the hon. Gentleman says about his circular will go some way to meeting the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make one other point which perhaps he might be good enough to bear in mind when he is framing this circular, that there is nothing which requires the local authority ever to follow up a repairs notice with the compulsory acquisition procedure. That does mean that one can have a situation in which the local authority can look at somebody's house, and, if it is an old house, one can almost always find a great many things which, one can argue, should be done to it in its structural condition. Suppose a local authority, Edinburgh, for example, which might take some sort of politically motivated dislike to one of my constituents, were to look at his house and say, "This chap is not maintaining his property as he ought. We shall serve a repairs notice on him." He may repair one thing which the authority drew attention to, and it may leave the notice in force, because it can nearly always find something else which needs to be done—either his drainpipe wants tightening or his gutter needs securing; there is always something to be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So I think that is a matter of some concern, and I shall be very interested to read the circular, and I hope that it will meet my point. In the hope and expectation that it does do so, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This is obviously excusable when there is a time interval of several years perhaps between new Bills and one is improving on the last, but here we have the extraordinary overlapping between two Bills coming on consecutively, this Bill and the Housing Bill. I would refer the Committee to Part II of the Housing Bill,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>514</span>

	<br><q><p>"if they are satisfied that the building has been deliberately allowed to fall into disrepair".</p></q>
I should have thought this would give rise to very complicated legal arguments. I do not know whether it is something which is definable. I suppose, till we have a test case to prove it, we shall never really know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one particular problem which strikes me in connection with this, that of the man who perhaps has been deliberately neglecting the repairs of his house on the grounds that he is expecting to inherit a legacy from his aunt or something in a couple of years time and could not carry out the necessary work till she dies.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not repeat what I have said. I do think that there may be reasons why a man has deliberately not been spending money on repairing his house. One is that he may be waiting for somebody to die and leave him some money so that he can do the necessary work, or the stock market may crash due to some form of Government credit squeeze and he cannot get the cash to do it. There are hundred and one reasons. I wonder whether these matters have been taken into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It goes on to qualify:
	<br><q><p>"deliberately allowed to fall into disrepair for the purpose of justifying its demolition and the development or re-development of the site"</p></q>
so that the reasons for the deliberate action are very limited.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that this does meet the point about which I was worried. I may have been looking at this in too narrow a context.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged to my right hon. Friend the Member for East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How does a local authority satisfy itself on the innermost working of an owner-occupier's mind? It has to be satisfied here, as the right hon. Member for East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn) pointed out, not only that has the building been
	<br><q><p>"deliberately allowed to fall into disrepair".</p></q>
That might be an inference which could be drawn from the circumstances, but it goes on, as he so rightly pointed out, to say that it must also be satisfied as to the purpose for which it has been allowed to fall into disrepair, namely:
	<br><q><p>"for the purpose of justifying its demolition and the development or re-development of the site or any adjoining site,"</p></q>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>516</span>
How does a local authority satisfy itself on that matter? On the face of it, it seems a difficult proposition to put up for a local authority to resolve. If it were simply to be satisfied that it had been
	<br><q><p>"deliberately allowed to fall into disrepair"</p></q>
it seems that that could be ascertained by any objective person, but the purpose for which it has been allowed to do that is something very much more difficult. If that is the gravamen of the charge, as it were, then is it right that that should be left entirely to the discretion of the local authority? Should it not be tested by some other objective test? I think my noble Friend has once again raised a matter which perhaps the Committee ought to be looking into, and the right hon. Member for East Stirlingshire has underlined the need for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can only dissent, from what the hon. and learned Member has just said, that I thought that the noble Lord was satisfied that the reason why we could look at this question of being deliberately neglected was the narrow reason which later on my right hon. Friend recited from the Clause. That is a very narrow point. The noble Lord was giving us examples, without following up this qualification, of a man being short of money or his son dying or the stock market crashing and all these kinds of things—in other words, for motives not within this Clause. The local authority can hardly rest its case on such motives as these. It can only exercise judgment as best it can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is known to most of us that this kind of practice goes on in different parts of Scotland. I know that my own local authority would be very satisfied about this in relation to one or two properties which I could name, although I will not at the moment. I am sure that the noble Lord can think of one or two examples in his own constituency. The merit of the Clause lies in the fact that it restricts itself only to this one issue, where it has been alleged that this ground exists as the sole reason for allowing these properties to fall deliberately into disrepair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

of making representations to the Secretary of State before the order is made? I assume that it does. If it does, then there is a safeguard, because on the face of it wide discretion is given to a local authority to make up its mind as to why someone allowed a property to fall into disrepair, when it would be almost impossible to prove it by any objective means.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could I further ask whether it would not be 	<i>ultra vires</i> if the local authority did this in bad faith?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Subsection (5) gives the right to apply to the sheriff for an order to put a stop to the direction of the minimum compensation. This, therefore, forms a parallel to Clause 49(6). If the sheriff is satisfied that the building has not been allowed deliberately to fall into disrepair, he is to make an order accordingly. Subsection (6) gives the right of appeal against the decision of the sheriff to the Court of Session, but on a point of law only. Subsection (7) provides that the right to apply to the sheriff, or to appeal to the Court of Session shall not prejudice those rights conferred by Clause 49(6).

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, I have one brief question for the Minister. Does the fact that the consent of the Secretary of State for Scotland is not required mean that none of the money contributed under the Clause is recoverable by the local authority from the Treasury? This may link up with comments which the Minister made earlier in connection with Clause 49. Here we have mention of yet another Act, the Historic Buildings Act, which adds to our state of confusion and illustrates the awful proliferation of legislation during recent years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As this is the last time I intend to speak for hours, may I take this opportunity of saying that if the Minister has been trying to bamboozle me with some of his answers this afternoon, he has been successful? May I thank him, nevertheless, for being so forthcoming on several points?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if I appeared to bamboozle the hon. Gentleman from time to time.

with this Clause. I am sorry about the proliferation of Acts, but it is far better that we get good Acts on the Statute Book than that we have consolidation Measures which are just great elephants of Acts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the noble Lord for his keen interest. As the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North, it would be a terrible shame if he did not take part in discussing this part of the Bill. I am sure that we should all be pleased if he put his views on record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alick Buchanan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why, by subsection (5) are hon. Members excluded from planning inquiry commissions? One knows that there are various problems of offices of profit under the Crown, but, as the Minister of State knows, in the House there are many experts on planning procedures, or on planning inquiries of one kind or another. It seems a pity that such talent should not be available for planning inquiries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Could the Minister of State also give us some indication of the kind of person whom he envisages being appointed to a planning inquiry commission?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.0 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is an interesting argument that we should not apply Part II of Schedule I of the House of Commons
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>520</span>
Disqualification Act, 1957. But with a planning commission it is not so much a question of an office of profit as the fact that an hon. Member might have a direct constituency interest, or a business interest, or possibly a Parliamentary interest. I am not saying that hon. Members are not able to serve on these commissions with the same degree of effectiveness as planners, even distinguished ones, and lawyers, even clever ones. But I consider it to be in the public interest that when a planning inquiry commission is set up, it ought to be composed of persons as neutral as possible. I hope that we may resort to the use of some of the distinguished men on the present reporters' panel, or recruit distinguished laymen who have retired, either from the Civil Service, or from an active part in business, and who might be willing to take part and whose talents would be useful, being the kind of people who would command public acceptability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Scotland we have not had examples of this type of commission, although we have Parliamentary Commissioners who deal with Parliamentary Bills but not with public policy on planning, as these commissions would. I therefore hope that the Committee will agree to accept as a self-denying ordinance that as Members of Parliament we cannot serve on these planning inquiry commissions, although we recognise the need for men of distinction to be on them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it proposed to have a commission which will act as a body and make recommendations to the Secretary of State in planning appeals in the same way as an individual reporter does now? If that is the case, is it envisaged that one could get a minority report? This idea of a commission is an interesting experiment, because one can visualise planning inquiries of such enormous social and economic significance that they would become a heavy burden on one man. Even if the reporter is accompanied by a technical assessor, he still has to make the recommendation himself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I envisage that we would have a panel chaired by a lawyer, who is the most suitably qualified person to chair a commission of this nature, assisted not by other lawyers—one would not want to see more than one lawyer on a commission of this nature—but by lay people such as those

who already take part in this form of inquiry. That is how I envisage the working of a commission but because this is a new departure, we should like to know what the Government have in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Clark Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will confine my remarks to this Clause, although it hooks up with Clause 60.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I am not sure how these new arrangements will work, will the Minister tell me whether they will enable me to stop Government Departments from coming into good residential areas in my constituency to put up buildings which should not be there? If that should happen in future, can I raise the matter under this Clause? Are Government Departments to be under the same rules as other people or companies?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is there anything in the nature of an appeal arrangement in the Clause? In other words, should the present inquiry about Alnwickhill go against the objectors, could I raise an appeal? Will the people serving on the commission have power to say that once a decision is made, it will stand for a certain time, say, 20 years, and will not be subject to challenge a year later by some greedy local authority?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of what the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) has said, I am prompted to comment that I cannot see anything in the Clause which indicates that the best person to chair these commissions would be a lawyer. I should have thought that anybody with experience of taking the chair and conducting business meetings would be as suitable for this job. I am alarmed by the way lawyers grab all the jobs for themselves, so much so that we are always being compelled to appoint additional judges. This small coterie, a tiny clique of 110 members of the Bar, are gathering unto themselves all the lucrative jobs in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>522</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. As a lawyer myself I am reluctant to stop the right hon. Gentleman, but we have moved on from Clause 60.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that you would intervene Mr. Brewis. I felt that I was getting rather wide of the mark. I apologise to you for having been swept away by the feelings of indignation which rose in my breast at the words of the hon. and learned Member for Pentlands. Nevertheless, I should be glad to learn from my hon. Friend whether he thinks there is anything in the Clause that necessitates having a lawyer in the chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to you, Mr. Brewis, for drawing our attention to the fact that it would be out of order to answer all the questions on Clause 61. What I can say legitimately to my right hon. Friend is that under Clause 61 the functions of a planning inquiry commission are to decide whether the considerations are:
	<br><q><p>"relevant to the determination of that question and require evaluation".</p></q>
I accept that evaluation does not have to be carried out necessarily by a lawyer in the chair, but there is a good argument for saying that the presence of a lawyer in certain circumstances might be of advantage. But there are arguments for having other people in the chair. Subsection (2)(	<i>b</i>) says:
	<br><q><p>"the technical or scientific aspects of the proposed development are of so unfamiliar a character as to jeopardise a proper determination of that question unless there is a special inquiry for the purpose."</p></q>
Depending on the circumstances, there may be a case for saying that a technical man who knows his job would be useful, because, although a lawyer knows the techniques of law, he may not know anything about specialised scientific or technical matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can see there is an argument for a person of that kind, but we have distinguished laymen on the panel who would be excellent chairmen and coordinators of the different technical people who could serve on a commission. A commission would be of a special kind and not for local purposes. Therefore the answer to questions asked by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) is that the Clause would not apply. He would have to use the present legislation
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1102">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>523</span>
as we have revised it, and past legislation, to secure his objectives in these other matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will this be a permanent planning inquiry commission composed of the same people, or will the Secretary of State vary the members to suit a particular case? If the Secretary of State is to pay these people, would that not make it impossible for any Member of Parliament to be a member of a commission?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Commission would be 	<i>ad hoc.</i> There could be one commission tackling various jobs and the Secretary of State might decide to have another, so that there could be two commissions at the same time. One commission could be disbanded and another started. There would be nothing permanent about a commission. On the other hand, there is no one single job that any commission has to carry out and then cease. The point about a commission is that it is appointed to carry out a special task which is not provided for in present legislation, going through all the different procedures, for example, the present procedures on the River and Firth of Clyde. We have already had two planning applications come in, one of which is the subject of a public inquiry, and one of which may be the subject of a public inquiry soon, the Secretary of State having called for the inquiry. It may be that a Planning Inquiry Commission could have been asked to do that. It is a possibility. It might have been asked to do several tasks arising from the various developments proposed there. These inquiries are of a national or substantial regional character.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline Burghs (Mr. Adam Hunter) referred—I cannot remember at which siting—to what would happen if we had a matter concerning England and Scotland, and I said that that was the kind of matter which could be dealt with by a Planning Inquiry Commission. But unfortunately, under the present Bill and the English legislation we do not have that knitting together. I am willing to look at the question on Report, once I have advice and authority from the House. The Committee has, I hope, grasped my point that the inquiries are special, 	<i>ad</i>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>524</span>
	<i>hoc</i> and of a substantial regional or national nature.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not at all satisfied with that reply. I do not see why the commission cannot look into the question of a Government Department invading part of a residential area of a city. That is very important. Where is the line between the ordinary procedure as at present and what these people will do? What is the demarcation line? I do not understand. Why cannot they be given some sort of appeal function?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will remember Clause 61(1)(	<i>d</i>):
	<br><q><p>"The following matters may, in the circumstances mentioned in subsection (2) below, be referred to a Planning Inquiry Commission….</p></q>
	<br><q><p>"(	<i>d</i>) a proposal that development should be carried out by or on behalf of a government department".</p></q>
If it is of a substantial character which involves a special inquiry, it can be subject to this procedure. It depends on the circumstances, and it depends on the nature of the development.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the Edinburgh ring road be of that character? I should have thought that that was a substantial matter involving regional considerations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not think so. If my right hon. Friend were to rephrase his question and apply it to the Land Use Transportation Study of the East of Scotland—that is, Edinburgh plus the Lothians and Fife—I would say, "Yes, that would be of that character". I think that the ring road which is, after all, part of the reflection of transport movements in a whole region, is not in itself enough for a commission. Let me correct myself. It could, within the terms of the Bill, be considered as a part. If my right hon. Friend is asking for an opinion I would say I should probably take it wider than that. But if he is asking, "Is it statute-barred?", the answer is, "No, the Bill would allow that to be considered."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has not grasped my second point. If there has been an inquiry, whether by a reporter, or these people or any other, and a decision is finally reached and upheld by the Secretary of State, how long does that decision remain? Once the decision has

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>525</span>
been made, I am very much against a return to the attack in a year or two, with a lot more expense involved. How do we deal with that point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is that, as long as there is no change in circumstances, and none of the parties asks for a reopening of it, the decision will stand. But the hon. Gentleman cannot insist that decisions shall be in perpetuity, because that would be impossible to maintain, or that circumstances must not change, when even he could change his mind and regard the original decision as wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not suggesting that it should be forever. But it should be for a certain period of time; otherwise, people are put in jeopardy. From what the Minister has just said, do I take it that all the people in Alnwickhill are safe, because there has been no change of circumstances? Is that right?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot comment because that is the subject of an inquiry. The inquiry comes where the circumstances have changed, or where various new factors have emerged to guide the reporter and the Secretary of State to another decision. The hon. Gentleman is asking me to pronounce sentence when all the facts have not been gathered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Reverting to what my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) said, I have a great deal of sympathy with his point of view. There was an inquiry into his particular problem in 1964. The planning authority comes along a year or two later pleading change of circumstances. Would the Minister agree that there is a heavy onus on the local authority to discharge there? We cannot have a public authority trailing individual groups of objectors from inquiry to inquiry at their own expense. Would he invoke, in appropriate circumstances, the provisions of the Local Government (Scotland) Act, 1947, and give these objectors their expenses at these inquiries? This is one of the biggest problems in Edinburgh at the moment—individuals being trailed from inquiry to inquiry, and the Secretary of State rarely, if ever, invoking the provisions of the Local Government Act in regard to expenses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>526</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a very elastic debate on the Clause. That matter could be considered. The public inquiry on Alnwickhill was carried out in 1964. The Corporation thought again, on a change of circumstances, I believe, in 1968. [An HON. MEMBER: "Disgraceful."] It may be disgraceful, but circumstances can change quite rapidly in four years. If one were arguing about it, would one say ten years? We argued this on the previous Clause, and we all agreed that 15 years would be absurd. I would say that ten years is too long. In this case, it is only four years. It is not for me to defend the present position on the inquiry at Alnwickhill. I think that I have been reasonable enough so far. I really must not, as a Minister, get involved in this. I would suggest that we come back to the Question on this Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>DELEGATION OF PLANNING FUNCTIONS TO OFFICERS OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 99, in page 57, line 14, at end insert 'suitably qualified'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is intended in the appointment or delegation of local planning authorities in this context? The words in the Clause are,
	<br><q><p>"any officer of the authority"</p></q>
Does that mean simply a paid official, and, if so, what sort of paid official? Could it include everybody from the local school janitor onwards, any paid official in the service of the local authority? Does it include unpaid members of committees and so on within the local authorities? It would be wise to put in the words "suitably qualified".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important matter. We have now come to the delegation of planning functions, and, no doubt, we shall have a number of matters raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The idea that the delegation could go to just anyone is quite wrong. Our understanding of the situation is this. Clause 63(1) sets out six different classes of application which the local authority
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1104">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>527</span>
may delegate. These classes embrace applications of different kinds and complexities. Furthermore, delegation may be made with or without restrictions or conditions, and it must me made to named officers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question is whether the local authority will delegate the functions to officers fully qualified to discharge them. Of course, they should. If they do not, the matter ought to be raised in the council itself, because it would not be right. It will be not to an anonymous officer but to a named officer. Therefore, if any person is aggrieved, not by a circumstance or a decision but by the fact that Mr. X is named for one or some of these six functions, and the feeling is that he is not qualified, the question should be raised at that time. But we are leaving it to the discretion and good sense of local planning authorities not to delegate their functions—they are not obliged to delegate their functions; it is up to them to decide—to officers who are not able to carry them. They ought to be given to competent men, to men who can assess the situation sensibly. It is on that basis that we ask that the Clause remain as it is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder why my hon. Friend has not looked on this Amendment more favourably. As I read the Clause, anyone can be appointed, and, as far as I can see, no one can do anything about it. What harm is done by putting in "suitably qualified"? At least, somebody would then be able to say, "The Act says he must be suitably qualified, and not Joe Smith's brother-in-law". I cannot see anything wrong with these words.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is meant by an officer? What is my right hon. Friend's view on that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would say that an officer of the local authority is anybody working for the local authority. There is nothing wrong with that, if that is what one means. I suppose that a street orderly might be an officer of the local authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is going on down there?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>528</span>
having a sit-in up here, and a very interesting sit-in too. My hon. Friend raised the question, What is an officer? What is the exact definition of an "officer of the authority"? This is very general. In any case, there is considerable anxiety about the Clause, and some feeling about this delegation of powers. It must surely be wrong to leave it in this unsatisfactory, general sort of form, whereby any Tom, Dick or Harry can be appointed to a job requiring, I assume, a certain amount of experience and expert knowledge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Dempsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we accept the concept of a "suitable" officer, who is to define who is suitable?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The words proposed are "suitably qualified". There might be an argument against these words, but my hon. Friend the Minister of State did not adduce that argument, so I assume that he does not find anything wrong with the words as such. If he does not find anything wrong with the words, I cannot see what harm there is in putting them in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I come into this controversy? I have every sympathy for the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. James Davidson) in raising this point, because, as the Minister of State knows, there has been a certain amount of concern in certain quarters over the whole matter of delegation of powers. I agree that any local authority behaving responsibly would never dream of delegating these powers to someone who was not properly qualified, yet it is not so stated in the Bill. This is the point of the hon. Gentleman's argument. He is all the more right to raise it because of the questioning outside this Committee about how these powers will be used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that these words may not be quite right. How does one determine that somebody is "suitably qualified", as the hon. Member for Coatbridge and Airdrie (Mr. Dempsey) said? But is there not a case here for the Minister of State to look at to see, even if the exact words of the Amendment are not correct, whether something could be done, perhaps on Report, to help to allay a great deal of suspicion? It may be unjustified suspicion, but there is supicion outside this Committee, and we ought to recognise it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are making very heavy weather of what seems a very common-sense provision. A local authority, as the Minister of State says, may not delegate anything at all, but, if it does not, all sorts of people will be asking for their particular issue to be settled by a town council meeting. If it be a question of lopping trees, which is one of the issues here, the sensible thing is for the local authority to have power to appoint a master gardener or somebody of that kind who knows about lopping trees to go along and see the thing. Obviously, if an officer is to deal with a specific matter, the local authority will choose a suitable person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can suspect anybody of anything. We can suspect him of appointing the medical officer of health to see about the lopping of trees. But we must assume that local authorities have intelligence. I agree that the officers must be fully qualified. That is a matter for the local authority to judge, even if the amendment is made. The local authority must judge whether they are fully qualified, because it appoints the persons involved. I think that we should leave this discretion to the local authority, and not try to run all the details of its work under statute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before deciding whether to withdraw the Amendment, I should like more assurance from the Minister. Perhaps I was rather unfair to him. I made a very short speech, being conscious that he is keen to get on with the Bill, and I hardly gave him time to lift his thoughts from the last debate to the present one. But he did not answer my questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, the Minister did not define what is meant by "any officer of the authority". He did not state his objection to my very simple Amendment, which, although it may not be vital legally, cannot but improve the present wording. Surely, he is not suggesting that the local authority would appoint or delegate to an unqualified officer. In terms of the word "qualification", I was thinking of a planning or legal qualification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, if the Amendment were inserted, would it be possible to dispense altogether with subsection (5)? I have not put that down as an Amendment, but if the officer appointed by the local
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>530</span>
authority is suitably qualified, it seems to me that there would not be any need for subsection (5) at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I have an assurance from the Minister that he will look at those points?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the last point, I suggest to the hon. Gentleman that, however well qualified an officer was, by any standard, even by the standard of the court, it would be essential to have subsection (5) for reasons which are divorced from this question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I confirm that the definition of "any officer" is, literally, any officer of the authority, a paid employee of the council. It could, I agree, be a part-time employee of the council, but it would be a paid employee of the council. If anyone wants to make something of this, it could be the lowliest official of the council. But, at least, let us admit that he would be named, and it would be known that one of So-and-so's functions was in respect of this Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is very fair in saying that incorporation of the Amendment may not give it legal force. I think that that is right. Who would decide who was suitably qualified? What it would do is leave it open to argument that the Clause had not been acted upon because So-and-so was not suitably qualified. It all depends what one means by "suitably qualified". I take the example of tree lopping instanced by my right hon. Friend the Member for East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn). That is not an easy job to undertake. Anyone with a knowledge of trees knows that one ought to have a first-class specialist to advise on topping off if one wants to preserve a tree. A suitably qualified man, in my estimation, ought to be a first-class man in this field. He would come forward not just for planning but for reasons of technique, and give advice on how it would be done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But we are discussing planning functions, not the physical qualification of being able to cut a tree down. The example the hon. Gentleman gives is not a good one to lend weight to his argument. I am interested in the planning function. I am not interested in how a tree should be lopped or cut down. I am interested in whether it is in the interests of good planning

in the neighbourhood to leave a tree, to lop it, or to cut it down. These are planning considerations, not technical considerations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must disagree with the hon. Gentleman. It is a matter of courtesy in debate always to reply to examples given if they are relevant. I considered my right hon. Friend's example relevant. The hon. Gentleman may not, but it is a matter of good courtesy on my part, which I would hope he would follow, in trying to reply. My right hon. Friend gave that example. I happen to know, from personal experience, of an example where planning permission given without thought to this matter can undo the very object of the planning permission. This reinforces the point I am making.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We would all like not just suitably qualified people, but the best qualified people to give advice on these matters. Not every local authority can employ the best qualified people. The conditions of qualification and so on are a matter of other regulations. As I understand it, there are only certain categories of town council employees who are suitably qualified. It is not the law that a town clerk must be a lawyer. Are we to say that town clerks must not be named here be-caused they are not lawyers? Must every small planning authority—Thurso and St. Andrews are examples of small planning authorities—have highly qualified persons for all these functions? They may decide not to delegate. It is a matter for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The inclusion of these words could be legally damaging to the statute. They could be fatal to it. I will not incorporate them, not because I am against their meaning but because I am against their being included in the Bill, making it weak in operation and open to a deal of argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the reservation that, in the last analysis, answerability for delegation lies with the local council. If the local council is foolish enough to delegate its function to a man unable to carry it out, it deserves to be hauled over the coals by the local community. We are hoping that local authorities will behave well, as they usually do, in delegating these functions. It would surprise hon. Members who have not served on planning committees to find how many planning functions are now—in effect, if not in law—delegated
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>532</span>
to the officers of the council. We must be realistic about this. I am not against the words—I hope that the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. James Davidson) will agree with me here—as words in the common parlance of discussion, in the colloquialisms of everyday life. They are quite sensible words. On the other hand, I do not think that they should be incorporated in the Bill, for the reasons which I have tried to put to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If these words were incorporated in the Clause, it would open the door, whenever one sought to challenge the decision of an official, to an assertion that he was not properly qualified. The standard is an objective standard,
	<br><q><p>"may delegate to any' suitably qualified' officer".</p></q>
A "suitably qualified" officer introduces an objective criterion which could be tested, in the last resort, in the courts. The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West, does not want that either. What he wants is to be sure that a decision on planning matters is not delegated to a janitor in the employment of the local education authority. It is inconceivable that a local authority would do that. Perhaps the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) has such faith in local authorities that he considers that they might do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised at the use of "janitor".

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That still might not make him a suitably qualified person to consider a planning application. The hon. Gentleman has raised one of the difficulties on this whole Clause. We do not like the Clause at all. However, looking at his own Amendment in isolation, if something like that were to be written in, it would have to be written in on the basis that in the opinion of the local authority he was suitably qualified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was intending to address this question to the Minister, but I shall give the Minister a rest and put it to the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) instead.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>533</span>
to me—I have no wish to be pedantic—that if instead of "any" there was "an", that would be better. Would it make the Clause legally vulnerable if it said
	<br><q><p>"may delegate to an officer of the authority"</p></q>
instead of
	<br><q><p>"to any officer of the authority"?</p></q>
It is the sense of "any" officer of the authority which gives the wrong feeling to the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be that the use of "an" would narrow down the selection, and the implication would be that it would be to an officer who was qualified to deal with it. That is what the hon. Gentleman is after. The other way would be to say, "to an officer of the authority who in the opinion of the authority was suitably qualified", or something of that sort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument to which the hon. Gentleman's Amendment has given rise focuses attention on the weakness and unsatisfactory nature of the provision being promoted here, namely, that one delegates to an official of the corporation a decision which is essentially a planning or a policy decision. That is something to which we can come on a later Amendment. It underlines the point we are about to make</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept the last point made by the hon. and learned Gentleman. I am satisfied that what he said earlier is most helpful. It has sparked off the possibility that, while I accept these words in principle, I cannot recommend their incorporation in the Bill as they stand. If the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his Amendment, I am prepared to put down an Amendment like this which will remove any doubt but not weaken the Bill. It may be a rather long Amendment. It will be as short as I can make it, but it may be longer than this. If the hon. Gentleman does that, I give him that undertaking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for that answer. I suggest that a very short Amendment which might have the desired effect is the one I put to the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie), namely, the substitution of "an" for "any".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On that assurance, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>534</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dempsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman withdraws, may I raise another point? There is an old "school" in local government service today who did not require the paper qualifications that the present generation are asked to acquire. Some of them are the finest technical officers any authority ever had, not by academic standards but by practical and technological standards. Some of these officers are maintaining, administering and developing some of the largest counties in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be a mistake to introduce something which might be restrictive and debar the local authority from having the excellent services of such practical-minded people. I ask the Minister to bear that in mind. Some of us have doubts about all the paper qualifications which are called for nowadays. There is today a tremendous amount of empire-building. Two or three gardening superintendents get together and form a society. The society becomes some sort of university. Soon, there are separate academic qualifications, and they are at the empire stage within a few years. This is what has been happening in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The people of whom I am thinking are some of the most able in the country. It would be a great mistake to restrict the interpretation of the Clause so as to exclude them. It is almost an insult to local authorities to suggest that "any officer" means that one sends a building officer to decide whether a tree should be cut down. It is an insult to suggest that local authorities in Scotland are not capable of deciding which officers should undertake which responsibility. I cannot agree with that attitude.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was not my intention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dempsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that it is not the intention. It certainly would not be fair. We have experienced deciding whether trees would enhance a landscape in a development, or whether they were rotting at the roots and should be uprooted. These problems arise and the planning officers have to decide, not the housing architect or the road engineer. Obviously, the officer in that instance would be a landscape gardener, an expert. The same sort of thing happens if it is decided to alter the course of a

little stretch of water main in order to add to the amenities of an area. One does not send along the road surveyor or the director of education; one sends a water inspector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend will bear in mind that local authorities are sensible and responsible and that their officers are capable of delegating duties to those able to undertake such a responsible job and report back.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mention these things because I feel that my hon. Friend is being dragged into something. I am concerned about him, because I like him. He has handled the Bill excellently and I should not like to see him blotting his copybook by being harangued, harassed, bullied and cajoled into accepting an Amendment of this nature. I hope that he will bear in mind what I have said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With such a formidable ally, it is tempting to look at this matter again. In the Amendment which would replace this I will certainly take into account the points put to me by my hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge and Airdrie (Mr. Dempsey). It must be the judgment of the local authority as to which officer is able to carry out the duties, and it is for the authority to judge the standard of officers it chooses. I accept that many people do not have the paper qualifications but are still as capable of doing their job, and often more capable, as others in possession of substantial qualifications. I accept that that is a well-known fact in local authority life, but I do not think the hon. Member means to reflect on the competence of one person or another. Like the rest of us, he wants to see that the persons concerned are suitably qualified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I have to do is to find such words that we do not open the door to much legal argument and yet achieve our agreed objective. Paper qualifications or qualifications of experience are equally to be considered.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This batch of Amendments reflects our concern about the provisions of the Clause. It may almost be said that the argument on these Amendments is also the debate on the Clause as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is proposed that a local planning authority will be given power to delegate to one of its officials certain discretionary powers which it exercises and enjoys. I say at the outset that I appreciate the force of the argument that in certain circumstances this may be desirable, where no element of discretion comes in and it is a pure question of ascertaining ascertainable facts on which a decision inevitably must follow. I am thinking, for example, of the discretionary powers which the clerk of works has under dean of guild regulations in certain cities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph (	<i>e</i>) of this subsection might equally well be said to be appropriate for an official to decide, as it does not involve any questions of policy or the exercise of any discretion. After all, it relates to whether an established use certificate under Clause 17 should be given, and what constitutes established use is a pure question of fact upon which the decision follows once the facts have been ascertained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be special circumstances such as those in which it might not be inappropriate to delegate to an official, but in our view, wherever a question of policy arises, wherever the exercise of a discretion arises in the use of local authority powers, it is wrong that that power should be delegated to an official. Perhaps the clearest test of this is paragraph (	<i>a</i>), an application for planning permission under Section 12 of the 1947 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say that it is wrong that that power should be delegated in any circumstances for a variety of reasons. I have already
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1109">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>537</span>
mentioned one—the exercise of a discretionary power which heretofore has been conferred on and confined to local authorities. Secondly, an application for planning consent under Section 12 of the 1947 Act, for example, is an application which matters a great deal to the applicant. Indeed, no more bitterly fought inquiries are there than appeals and inquiries ordered on appeal against the refusal under Section 14 of an application under Section 12. If it means a lot to the applicant, he is entitled to the decision not of an official, but of the planning authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is bad, too, from the other point of view, in that it puts the official in an invidious position. I cannot believe that this is something for which planning officials—and presumably it would be the planning officer who would have to decide applications of this nature—and local authorities want responsibility. We know that it is almost invariably the practice that the decision is taken by a planning committee on the advice of the planning officer, but the decision is that of the committee and it has an anonymity about it. If we are to give this discretonary power to an official who is to be named, we shall put him in an invidious position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, and I say this advisedly because one must recognise the facts of life, it exposes that individual, or might expose that individual, to undesirable pressures, because he is an individual who is named, because he is living in the community in which the applicant himself may reside, because he may even be on close personal terms with the applicant himself. I am not suggesting for a moment that these officials in the exercise of their powers would abuse their responsibilities. All I say is that it could introduce undesirable pressures, which is one reason why the official himself is not likely to welcome these proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not intend at this hour to develop this argument at great length. It is a short but important point. We are making a break with practice and we are making a substantial change. It is not a change justified by any circumstances which have been brought to our attention, and it is a change which the Committee should be reluctant to sanction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>538</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will break my long silence today because this an important Clause and I want to press the Minister to accept these Amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He will agree that the planning committee on most local authorities is one of the most interesting and a committee on which a place is sought. On that committee one has the opportunity to help develop the authority which one is representing. Most local authorities would be jealous of delegating these important powers to an official.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From where has the pressure come to introduce this Clause? I am certain that the officials do not want to have this power, because it will put them in a difficult position from time to time. I cannot think that the pressure will have come from elected members of local authorities who are there specifically to do this job. They are there to form a planning committee and to use their geographical knowledge of the local area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most planning committees bring into their committee representatives to cover the whole area, so that there is rarely an application about which at least one member of the Committee does not have first-hand knowledge, and this is right. A local authority is elected to do this job, and it is absolutely wrong that it should then have the optoin of delegating this authority to one of the officials.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that this is a discretionary power, but we are here to lead and not just sit back and let local authorities take an option we believe to be wrong. We want to involve the elected members of local authorities in local planning. That, after all, is one of the objectives of the Bill and it has been set out time and time again, particularly on the Second Reading of the English Bill by the Minister of Housing and Local Government. I want this power of the elected members to be retained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 12 is a huge Section of the 1947 Act giving great powers of planning approval. Section 29 contains the control of advertisements. Here again, if one is to set an example in a local authority of positive planning, of being prepared to refuse applications for advertisements and hoardings, it is one of the more difficult decisions that come before authorities. But it is a decision that the elected members must take, and not pass the buck to an official.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1110">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>539</span>
I think that we have made the point. The Minister may well say that this procedure is in the interests of speed. I think that he is wrong. It is rare that a well-organised local authority planning committee does not see an application within six or seven weeks, perhaps four weeks, perhaps three weeks. An applicant may just miss a meeting of the committee and have to wait a month for the next.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most local authorities, particularly when dealing with industrial development where speed is essential and where, if possible, one wants to give an industrialist planning permission within 24 or 48 hours of his application, delegate that authority to the chairman and vice-chairman of the committee, and it is promulgated at the next meeting of the planning committee. There is no question of a loss of time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On these points of responsibility and timing the Clause is absolutely wrong, and I hope that the Minister will withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will explain how the Clause will work. The hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) raised a point of great importance in planning. We all know that tremendous sums and tremendous interests are involved in planning decisions. When strong interests are involved, there is apt to be strong pressure and the kind of pressure which might be involved might not be conducive to the good conduct of local authority work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (5) seems to anticipate that those appointed to do this job may be accused of yielding to these pressures and of acting not in a 	<i>bona fide</i> manner. The very fact that they must be indemnified in advance suggests that it is feared that will take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister explain whether this is to deal with small matters which do not deserve the attention of the committee, or whether there is any reason why this should not be a matter which is eventually reported to the committee for final decision, so that the final decision is left in the hands of the committee in order to take away the personal responsibility of the individual who happens to be appointed? These are matters
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>540</span>
which ought to be made clear. Safeguards are needed against the danger of having to indemnify an officer against the possible accusations of, say, corruption and so on which create a bad atmosphere for planning. We ought to be assured that important matters of great value will not be decided by individuals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.0 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ought to try to clear up a number of misapprehensions raised during the debate and some genuine misunderstandings. Despite what the hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) said, he is not absolutely against the Clause. If he were, he would have sought to strike out the whole Clause. He is concerned about the references in paragraphs (	<i>a</i>), (	<i>d</i>) and (	<i>f</i>). In other words he is content for the others to remain. So he agrees that there is some merit in leaving comparatively less important matters for delegation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We accept at once that any delegation, small or large, is entirely permissive. No elected member gives up one inch of his power except by the volition of a majority of his colleagues, and he can revoke the giving up of that power at the authority's next meeting. In addition, he may impose any conditions, however detailed or extensive, on the nature of that delegation. We are going to enormous lengths to ensure that the Clause is permissive in all its parts, and that it is capable of being modified or even withdrawn at the drop of a hat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is wrong to say that the broad generality of planning committees discuss all these items completely and comprehensively. That is not true. Anyone who has served on the planning authority of a large city or a large authority knows that the vast majority of planning permissions are given virtually formally by the committee, because there are screeds and screeds of them. Anyone reading the minutes of an authority will see that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us disabuse ourselves as Members of Parliament, some of whom, like myself, have not served actively on planning committees, of the idea that all planning permission is somehow or other an infringement of somebody's rights. Many planning permissions are earnestly sought by the applicant and hopefully given. For the majority, planning decisions are not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1111">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>541</span>
a nasty thing. They can sometimes be adverse, but they are often hopefully awaited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some authorities, particularly in the North of Scotland and the sparsely populated parts of Scotland, the county council virtually goes out of action for three months a year. That means that no planning permission may be given for three or four months. Therefore, there is a good case in present circumstances for allowing those authorities who want to delegate responsibility, subject to all these safeguards to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely all planning committees have delegated power, so that permission does not have to be given by the full council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But it is still with the elected members. We are here talking about delegation to officials.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I do not have to appeal to hon. Members who represent these counties to testify to this; it is a fact. We are asking no one to do this. An authority may do it if it wishes. If it does not like it, it may withdraw it at the next meeting. There is no question of any compulsion from the centre. Indeed, one of the first things the Secretary of State would have to do, on the passing of the Bill as it stands would be to bring the local authority associations together, and they in their turn would bring their own members together in order to discuss the best possible way of implementing this provision in the different areas, knowing their different circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dempsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is this a provision from a previous Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We an deceiving ourselves if we believe that local planning councils—and I do not think there is anything improper in thiis—actually go into everybody's circum stances. The Bill would change nothing affecting the right of appeal. That is what the hon. and learned Member, no doubt inadvertently led us to believe he thought was the position. But that is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>542</span>
a misunderstanding, for there is nothing in this proposal affecting the right of appeal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, I thought that the hon. and learned Gentleman did. However, if he did not, it gives me the chance to emphasise that under this procedure there is no question of the right of appeal being infringed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What was said about an officer being embarrassed, for all kinds of reasons, family reasons, or friendly reasons, or reasons of there being a small local community, applies equally to councillors. If it is true that handing a decision to a local authority officer might embarrass him, under subsection (3) he could request:
	<br><q><p>"in the case of any application specified by him, the delegating authority shall themselves, instead of him, determine the application."</p></q>
If an officer felt that he did not want to do a particular task, he would ask the authority to take back the right it had handed to him. Subsection (5) is not a provision that has just been thought up by the Government. Local authority officers themselves have fairly said, "If we are asked to do this and do not contract out of doing this under subsection (3), may we have an insurance scheme?" I must say that as a doctor I sympathise with them, and I am sure that as a lawyer the hon. and learned Gentleman must sympathise with them. It seems a perfectly fair request if they are to be given duties which may expose them to litigation or to loss of money. We have therefore acceded to their request for subsection (5).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that in explanation of the general position, may I deal with each of the three points in turn? Paragraph (	<i>a</i>) is the heart of planning. If that were deleted, we might as well abandon Clause 63. I hope that the Opposition will not disagree with me about that. Without subsection (1)(	<i>a</i>), we might as well not have the Clause, because it would make a nonsense of the idea of delegation. I therefore regard this as an Amendment saying that delegation is only for minor and trivial matters, and that will not meet our problem of large and growing numbers of planning applications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1112">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>543</span>
The Amendment to delete subsection (1)(	<i>d</i>) is a different matter. I agree with the hon. and learned Member that this is a matter where we are in a dilemma. If we are to suppose that action is likely to be taken to abolish the right of appeal against the refusal of advertisement applications, I say, and I am willing to give this undertaking on behalf of my right hon. Friend, that we ought to make sure that no commencement order will be made under Clause 102(1) as regards Clause 63(1)(	<i>d</i>). I am advised that the power of commencement under Clause 102(1) is sufficiently selective to accomplish this. So, unless it is decided to keep advertisement appeals in existence, there will be no commencement order for the power of delegation of advertisement applications. In other words, the applicant will either retain his right of appeal, or he will retain his right to have his application considered by the elected representatives and not simply by the local planning authority's officers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the difference. I cannot tell the Committee what decision the Government are to take on this matter, but if the decision is as is supposed by the Opposition, I am willing to undertake that subsection (1)(	<i>d</i>) will not operate and that all cases will be heard by the elected representatives and will not be a delegated function. I am prepared to give that assurance. But if the decision is otherwise, we should leave the matter as it stands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: About a year ago there was floated the idea in the course of considering the English Bill that appeals to the Minister in applications under the control of advertisement regulations should be abolished. I understand that it was abolished, but that an undertaking was given in another place and that the position was restored to what it was. Do I now understand that the question of appeals in advertisement control regulations is now in a fluid state once more?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was not really abolished. What has happened is that under Section 29(1)(	<i>c</i>) of the 1947 Act advertisement regulations are made, and the question is whether we shall abolish the right of appeal. I have said that if the Government decide that such an appeal should be abolished, I will make
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>544</span>
sure, and I give this undertaking on behalf of the Secretary of State, that Clause 63(1)(	<i>d</i>) will not operate. That would be fair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, if it is not, that would be an entirely different question. I accept the substance of his argument in relation to that one specific function as being perfectly fair and sound, that in all cases the elected representatives should deal with that, if we are abolish-the right of appeal to the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph (	<i>f</i>) would omit the applications for:
	<br><q><p>"approval required by a development order or by a condition imposed on the grant of planning permission;".</p></q>
Both these types of application arise mainly in the context of subsequent approval of matters reserved at the time of the grant of planning permission for an outline application. Article 5(2) of the 1950 General Development Order provides that an applicant can apply under article 5(1) for approval, but:
	<br><q><p>"subject to the subsequent approval of the"—</p></q>
planning—
	<br><q><p>"authority with respect to … siting design or external appearance … or means of access".</p></q>
So even if he does not himself do so, the authority may grant planning permission subject to later approval of details. In either case, a subsequent application is necessary and this is the application which we suggest can be delegated under paragraph (	<i>f</i>). Frankly, I cannot see why this should not be so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be argued—I do not think that it has been so far—that in both cases matters covered by the application could be of such unusual significance or sensitivity or otherwise that they would have been covered by a straightforward application of Section 12, and could be delegated under (	<i>a</i>). I do not think that that would be common, and most of these cases would be no more special than any ordinary application.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come back to the main point upon which I rest my case, which is that this is, after all, permissible. The planning authority, at its own discretion, can decide which, if any, of these six categories it wishes to delegate. If it delegates under paragraph (	<i>f</i>), it can
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1113">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>545</span>
subject a delegation to any conditions or restrictions that it thinks fit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That being so, it has complete control over delegation, and there is no reason why it should not be left open to the authority to delegate to the extent that it chooses in the applications referred to under (	<i>f</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must emphasise to my hon. Friends that while I accept the importance of not undertaking this matter lightly—these things must be thought through, and must be constantly supervised by elected representatives and reviewed from time to time—it is bound to add to the efficiency of a planning authority in disposing of a great deal of work which comes before it. I would certainly not say that there are planning authorities in Scotland that can go along without delegating, either informally or, as in this Bill, quite formally, a large number of their decisions at the present time; decisions which, I may say, are to a great extent undisputed and very much welcomed by the applicant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise that this is a discretionary power, and that the official himself may disclaim the task which is put on his shoulders. In our view, however, this is contrary to principle. The elected representatives are elected in order to do the job themselves, not to delegate their responsibilities to paid officials of the corporation. For all the reasons which have been adduced by my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) and by the right hon. Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn), we are thoroughly opposed to Clause 63(1,a). I readily accept that that is the core of the matter. If that were to go, the whole Clause would have to go, and we are treating it on that basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dempsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my hon. Friend can assure me that this is a matter solely for the discretion of local authorities, then I believe the Clause should be accepted. As he says—and I think the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) realised this—there are certain planning duties which have to be delegated, especially in the case of the big authorities. They are only delegated because the committee has decided upon the broad strategy, and the officials have been asked to carry it out. This does not, of course, affect major movements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>546</span>
Let me quote one classic illustration. There are approximately 50,000 municipal houses in Lanarkshire. If one applies for planning permission to erect a garage, for example, provided it is behind a building line and that it is 17 ft. long and 10 ft. wide, permission is granted by the officials. To clutter up the time of the committee with that type of planning consent, which has already been approved, would add to the maladministration of planning in that very great county. I therefore accept from my hon. Friend that there are illustrations of that nature whereby it is wise, in the circumstances, to delegate, because the officials are responsible at any time, and a policy can be re-examined if in the light of experience it is felt that there is a need for taking an entirely different line of action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But there are many other aspects which it is absolutely vital should be kept in the hands of the elected representatives. These representatives were elected to govern a town, or a county or city, and they are entitled to do so. In this respect, it is absolutely essential that they should not only check their responsibility, but fulfil it, and be answerable to the electorate for their actions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was surprised when my hon. Friend told us that some of these counties were out of action for about three months of the year, so that the officials more or less ran the areas. If I were a member of a county in that area I should not tolerate that. I would insist that they should at least consult with their chairman from time to time on matters of policy, so that if a new policy is to be devised the committee can be called together to devise it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am anxious to hear that my hon. Friend will stand by a certain degree of advertisement control. This is an important matter. I hope that my hon. Friend, who happens to be a Co-operative Member, will not take exception, but I once had a first-class row because of the lack of advertisement control, which involved a two-tier system of advertising. The public health had the top advert, and the Co-operative Society the bottom. Ironically, the public health advertisement was in connection with V.D., and the lower advertisement read, "He got it at the

Co-op". The result in the area was absolute dynamite, and no wonder. It seems to me that some type of right of appeal, or type of protection, against a misunderstanding of that kind is absolutely desirable. I would be pleased to</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 189, in page 59, line 13, leave out subsection (3).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wondered, when reading this Clause, whether subsection (3) was really necessary. The preceding subsection (2) provides that, where a consent has been granted after the commencement of this Clause it is
	<br><q><p>"deemed to be granted, subject to the condition that the development to which it relates must be begun not later than…"</p></q>
the time factor later specified. Subsection (3) says in effect that, if nothing is said in the grant about the time factor, none the less, the time factor is deemed to be incorporated in the grant. I wondered whether subsection (2) did not in fact make that clear. If the Minister is satisfied that subsection (3) is necessary, of course I shall withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Subsection (3), which the Amendment proposes to omit is necessary to catch any case in which, for any reason—the most common reason, I would suspect, would be inadvertence itself—a permission is granted without the condition required by subsection (2). In such a case we would deem that the permission had been granted under a five-year limitation, notwithstanding its omission.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If Parliament provides that the local authority can only grant permission subject to such a condition, even if the condition is not written in in the grant, is it necessary to go on in the Statute and say it would be deemed to have been written in, because it is not an exercise of the original power?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><q><p>(2) For the purposes of this Part of this Act "specified operation' means any of the following, that is to say—
	<ol>
	<li>any work of construction in the course of the erection of a building;</li>
	<li>the digging of a trench which is to contain the foundations, or part of the foundations, of a building;</li>
	<li>the laying of any underground main or pipe to the foundations, or part of the foundations, of a building or to any such trench as is mentioned in the last preceding paragraph;</li>
	<li>any operation in the course of laying out or constructing a road or part of a road.</li></ol></p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 144 is a drafting Amendment, and the purpose of these two Amendments is to incorporate in that one Clause all that one really needs to know without having to go to another Act of Parliament, namely, the Land Commission Act, for a definition. The effect of this Amendment would simply be to delete the legislation by reference, as it were, in the brackets, and spell out in a new subsection precisely what "specified operation" means. I think it is better that a term like that should be specified in the Clause, rather than by reference to another Act of Parliament, especially if that other Act of Parliament is a piece of legislation which has a very great question mark hanging over it at the present time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would draw the attention of the hon. and learned Gentleman to the fact, Mr. Brewis, that in the second Amendment you have allowed us to discuss there are paragraphs (	<i>a</i>), (	<i>b</i>), (	<i>c</i>) and (	<i>d</i>), but there seems to be omitted (	<i>e</i>)—
	<br><q><p>"any change in the use of any land, where that change constitutes material development".</p></q>
and I assume that that is just an error.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is, yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No more than that, because I was wondering if there was some substance in the omission of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I might explain. For convenience I asked that the definition Section in the 1967 Act should be incorporated here. I did not, in fact, write out the whole Section. I think perhaps it is just an omission 	<i>per incuriam.</i> There is nothing sinister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>550</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, because I was confused by the second Amendment, because I thought that the hon. and learned Gentleman had a genuine argument about omitting (	<i>e</i>). But if that is the case, then our simple conflict of opinion is about whether or not there should be a cross-reference. I know there are advantages and disadvantages in cross-references, but I am advised that, in this case, the balance is in favour of a cross-reference. The issues arising on the Land Commission Act arise in every case of material development or change of use. The developer will, therefore, have occasion in every case to get to know what the words mean. The reference here which, if I may say so, does in 11 words what would otherwise require well over 100, is a valuable brevity which I would hope my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) would want to champion. I hope the hon. and learned Gentleman will not persist in saying that they ought not to have a cross-reference here but to make these two Amendments, I do feel we should have a cross-reference here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not like the idea of legislating by cross-reference. It means that someone reading this Clause has to go to the 1967 Act, look it up and find out what "specified operation" means. It may be a narrow balance—I do not know. It may be a matter of opinion. I must say that I prefer to see what words mean in a Section by looking further down in the Section or by going, perhaps, to the end of the Act to see what they mean. I do not like the idea of going to other Acts of Parliament. I am sure the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) would agree with me there, because it is not everyone, as I have said on other occasions, who has a set of the public general Statutes sitting on his bookshelves. One really likes to have all that one needs to know in an Act of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, if the Minister is not prepared to accept the Amendment, I certainly do not intend to press it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I do intend to press this, because this is one of the points that every practising lawyer objects to. They all think that, with the mass of legislation coming out today, it

should at least be clear, and that there should be clarity in each place. I think we are falling down in our job if we do not make the Statutes easier to read and to understand, and if it is only a matter of 11 words as against 100, I do not think that is very vital. So I do ask the Minister to look at this again and to accept the Amendment on behalf of all those who have to deal with the Bill when it is finally passed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The person concerned is bound to be consulting the Land Commission Act, surely, at this stage in order to guide himself through the Sections of this Act as it will be.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because he would be seeking to follow out these Sections—if the—and hon. Gentlemen will kindly read one.

I do not like legislation by cross-reference, but I think it would be a mistake to try to introduce into the Bill all this as distinct from the very simple reference that there is in the Bill. I am obliged to the hon. and learned Gentleman in not wanting to persist in this, and I am only surprised that the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These Amendments give rise to the question of the privileged position which statutory undertakers enjoy in the field of planning. This is a subject which could occupy our thoughts for quite a little time, if there were more time, because many of us have not for a long time felt awfully happy about the peculiar privileges of statutory undertakers. Their planning permissions are so often granted not by planning authorities but by Ministers, and one takes, for example, the application of an electricity authority for a generating station. It comes not before the local authority as planning authority; it goes straight to

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A Liberal Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot say. My history is not good enough for that. But it is a feature of statutory undertakers for which all parties at one time or another must bear responsibility. They are given these highly special and privileged positions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it is my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) who has a peculiar interest in this; and he knows the problems from personal experience, and I know that he is going to develop this argument more fully, but the effect of these Amendments is just this. Operational land has been given a definition in subsection (2). It is a definition which comprises two sets of circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we suggest is that it ought to be confined to land in respect of which there has been a specific planning permission, that is to say, not land for which there is or at some time has been in force a specific planning permission. What we are seeking to do is narrow it down. This is a highly technical field.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not say these Amendments themselves are beyond criticism, but I think we do want to get some idea from the Minister just where we are going in this Clause about statutory undertakers, because though in one sense some of these provisions appear to narrow the field for statutory undertakers, in this sense they do. For example, in subsection (2)(	<i>b</i>) there are alternative qualifications. That paragraph seems to suggest that land can be operational land if it is acquired by one statutory undertaker after it has already been in the hands of another statutory undertaker; in other words statutory undertakers can swap land about among themselves without any recourse to the planning authority; and provided there has been a specific planning permission in the first instance it would appear on the face of it that that planning per mission is carried forward for the benefit and enjoyment of the subsequent statutory undertaker, and the local planning authority has very restricted and limited powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think we must be careful about giving more powers to stautory undertakers. On
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>554</span>
balance I think we should be looking at their existing powers very closely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This Clause is my last appearance on my feet. I am very pleased to see my hon. and learned Friend back from another successful visit to the courts. Like everyone else I know where I want to go, and he has helped considerably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think the disappointing thing about these Clauses 68 and 69 is that we have really made very little effort to restrict the powers of the statutory undertakers, such as the Gas Board and the Electricity Boards, British Rail, and so on, and I think that we should, if we had had time, have looked at this extremely carefully. As my hon. and learned Friend has said, the statutory undertakers are very nearly clear of close control by the local authorities, and they have the added advantage of their power and financial backing. There are not very many private individuals prepared to take them on in court. I think with this Bill we want to be looking very closely at the rights of the individual in relation to the statutory undertakers. I find it disappointing that we have done so little in this Bill, because Cmnd. 3333, in paragraph 28, says:
	<br><q><p>"The methods of controlling development to be carried out by statutory undertakers are also being examined."</p></q>
Unfortunately, very little seems to have been done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have in Clauses 67 and 68 slightly reduced the powers by re-defining "operational land", but to get a proper interpretation of the definition of operational land in the 1947 Act I should think one would go to court straightaway. Perhaps the Minister could explain what the change in relation to operational land really means.

As I say, our Amendment would slightly restrict the powers of the statutory undertakers—not very much, and not as much as I would like; but I would particularly follow up the point of my hon. and learned Friend in relation to transfers from one statutory undertaker to another, because this does leave them an enormous opportunity to abuse of planning permission. I remember that my hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Graham Page) gave a wild example of Blackpool Pier being a statutory undertaker and the Gas Board being a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1118">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>555</span>
statutory undertaker, and if the Pier transferred its rights to the Gas Board it could put up a gasometer on the end of Blackpool Pier and nobody could do anything about it, because that would be covered by the planning permission. Where this is presently important in transfer is in relation to railway sidings, because the railways are selling off sidings, and when they sell them to a statutory undertaker they get automatic planning permission. This is something I think they should not have power to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like the Minister to say just a word on how much restriction there is on the undertakers in this Bill, in comparison with what there was before. I hope there is more restriction than I fear it is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One small point Could we possibly change this word from "undertaker" to "undertaking"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a very demoralising and almost depressing phrase, I quite agree, but the trouble is we have been used to this phrase in Statute for a long time, and I would with great reluctance seek to change it at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I will do is respond to the suggestions made by the hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro). I quite understand why he is not with us just for this second. The great change that we have made in the Bill as regards the statutory undertakers comes in Clause 70, which we will discuss, I hope, soon, where statutory undertakers lost their special position on compensation which they formerly enjoyed, and I know that loud hurrahs have gone up about that in more than one quarter in Scotland, but in relation to this matter we are discussing at the moment I think I ought to explain the law as it stands at the present time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Statutory undertakers can acquire and they can hold two kinds of land, operational and non-operational. The distinction is made by Section 113 of the 1947 Act. Broadly speaking, it is that operational land is land used for the purpose of carrying on the primary function of the statutory undertaking. Anything else, for example, showrooms or playing
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>556</span>
fields, car parks, staff colleges, and so on, are non-operational.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been some difficulty in the past because of planning permissions which were very general in their terms relating to land held by statutory undertakers. Thus, it would be possible for the undertakers to buy by agreement a plot of land which they fancy and then to claim operational use for it, although the land in question had never really been considered from the planning point of view for operational purposes. This was a grievance which local authorities had.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To rectify this, this Clause provides that land which is not operational when the Clause takes effect shall not become operational unless there is or has been in force a specific planning permission for operational purposes. This ensures that all planning implications of the proposed use are examined before the decision is made. The Committee should welcome that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendments seek to make two further restrictions on the Clause. The Clause says that it is sufficient that operational planning permission should have existed at some time in the past. The Amendment would provide that permission must still be in force. I do not think that restriction is justified. To achieve its purpose, the permission must cover planning permission granted on an application or deemed permission granted under Section 32 of the 1947 Act, and also any authorisation to carry out development contained in a local or a private Act, or an order approved by Parliament, designating specifically the nature of the development authorised and the land on which it may be carried on. In any of these cases, the planning factors relating to the operational character of the land will have been examined before the permission was given. It does not matter whether the permission is still in force, or not, at the appropriate time. It should be remembered that the effect of the permission is not to convey permission for the development contemplated, but merely to establish the status of the land as operational as distinct from non-operational land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second restriction which the Amendments would seek to make is that they would exclude the circumstances in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1119">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>557</span>
which a statutory undertaker who is asking for his land to be treated as operational land took the land which he has over from another statutory undertaker under the provisions of the Transport Act, 1968. The undertakers who would be affected in Scotland by this recent change, which the Amendments would affect, are The National Freight Corporation, which owns a considerable amount of operational land; the Scottish Transport Group which, under Section 28(2) of the Transport Act, 1968, took over the rights and liabilities of the Scottish Bus Group and the Caledonian Steam Packet Company Limited. This would be a great disadvantage to those concerned. It could also apply to any passenger transport executive which might be set up in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no reason why the transference of the holding of land should make any difference to the planning permission. The planning factors were examined in relation to the physical and social characteristics of the land and its surroundings. What was valid for one statutory undertaker, the previous one, should be equally valid for the new one, particularly when the functions of that statutory undertaker are being taken over by the new statutory undertaker, as in the examples I have given here.

I am sorry to take so long about this. I think it worth explaining. The officials of the Department, the local authority and the statutory undertakers have come together to discuss this. I am not suggesting that they are all content—it is obvious where the interests of different parties would lie—but it is the best workable way we have of improving the present position. This explanation should be helpful to the Committee. It does mean some loss to the statutory undertakers and some gain to the local authorities. It is the best balance we can strike in the circumstances. I would not like either of these two further restrictions to be made by the Amendments. I hope that the hon. and learned Gentleman and his hon. Friends will grant that we have done something—perhaps not as much as they would have wanted—and will not press the Amendments, which are too restrictive, as they stand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dempsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend explain another situation? A statutory authority acquires land and decides to erect one of the huge gas containers for the storage of natural gas from the North Sea. In those circumstances, what right of appeal have the residents in that neighbourhood against such an approved development?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recently, the National Gas Council decided to acquire a large area of land adjacent in the constituency of my right hon. Friend the Member for Lanarkshire, North (Miss Herbison), but the main township in that neighbourhood is Airdrie. It decided to proceed with a large scheme costing some £2 million in which it will erect these large containers It intends to have in those containers one day's storage of natural gas in the case of any emergency in some part of Great Britain. This has been approved; the site is selected, and it is proceeding with the contract. I should like to know the position of the residents who live there, in a situation like that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of them own their homes; they are owner-occupiers. That is their castle, a little home, which is to become involved and affected as a result of this development. If there is any feeling that it is going to give work, it is actually going to employ 12 people; that is all. However, under the legislation we are now discussing, particularly this Clause, what rights have residents living in the locality to appeal against such a development which has been approved by the Secretary of State?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my hon. Friend has not yet found the answer, I should like to ask him, arising out of the remarks of the hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro)—which rather alarmed me—whether if a statutory undertaking already has planning permission for certain land that it owns, and it hands it over to another statutory undertaking, that undertaking—as I heard him—can then make its own developments, without getting planning permission. The hon. Member raised the question of the railways. A number of us have large railway sidings, which are now becoming unused, right in the middle of our constituencies, often in the middle of residential areas. Do I understand that the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1120">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>559</span>
Gas Board could take over part of the Portobello rail sidings and erect gasometers in order to deal with North Sea gas without obtaining any further planning permission? Is this the situation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is. It was brought out particularly in the celebrated case of the Abingdon gasholder. Planning permission includes, in the case of statutory undertakers, permission to erect the necessary machinery or apparatus. That included a gasholder belonging to whatever Gas Board exists in that part of Oxfordshire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If this is so, this is most alarming. I would hate to see gasholders shoved up in the middle of my constituency because the Gas Board wanted somewhere to put its North Sea gas. I feel concerned about this. There ought to be some control over this. This must affect many hon. Members' constituencies. It certainly affects mine, and I would be alarmed to see this kind of thing happening.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, I thought these points were to be discussed on the Motion, That the Clause stand part of the Bill. However, for convenience, we can deal with them now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not discussing here the needs of the statutory undertaker to seek planning permission, in some cases with the sanction of the Ministry of Power, from the Secretary of State for Scotland. We are discussing the position of operational and non-operational land. To answer the question of my hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge and Airdrie (Mr. Dempsey), if what he described did happen in his constituency, whilst it is true that residents as such have no rights to object to the Gas Board's proposal, the local planning authority has the right to advertise the proposal as if it were a bad neighbour development. Representations would then be received by the local authority from these objecting residents and they would be considered and an inquiry held. That would be the operative mechanism there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been talking about the discussions to which the hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) referred, how far we are with them and how far we have made improvements in the position of persons, other than statutory undertakers. They have lost certain positions they for-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>560</span>
merly held. We are debating here whether or not they should have two further restrictions on operational land. I am suggesting to the Committee that these are too restrictive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other matters I hope I have answered, but they are of a more general kind, dealing with the planning position of statutory undertakers, which is somewhat different.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understood my hon. Friend this is all rather bewildering to me. The definition of operational land, what is comprised by and meant by operational land, does affect the position as regards the requirement of obtaining planning permission. Is this correct? Therefore, fit seems to me that this, with great respect to my hon. Friend—I know he puts himself out to meet my arguments—does affect the position that I have just specifically raised, and he did not really give me an answer. What is the position? One large area in Edinburgh is now being used for the building of a huge hotel for the Empire Games—at Petershill—which two or three years ago was railway workshops. I have got other large areas running down into Leith, Portobello, New Craig-hall and all sorts of places which the railways no longer require. This is operational land as I understand it, and operational land in accordance with this particular subsection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I am asking is, is it correct that this land can be transferred to another statutory undertaker, and that he can do what he pleases with it, in so far as it concerns his operations. If so, I do submit that this really is something which ought to be looked at at least, because it could certainly be the cause of a very great nuisance, not only privately but publicly, and could destroy the whole amenity of a particular area. I should have thought that of some importance in cities where there are very large railway sites.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend has not grasped the point. I may not have made it clearly enough. We have been working here for nearly three hours. Simply by transferring operational land from one statutory undertaker to another does not mean that they can do what they like with it. That is the phrase my right hon. Friend used. They must seek planning permission for what they propose to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

They have to get the permission of the sponsoring Minister—it depends what statutory undertaker we are talking about—as well as the planning Minister. It is true that in Scotland it could be the same Minister. But in relation to the gas holders, which my hon. Friend the Member for Coat-bridge and Airdrie (Mr. Dempsey) was concerned about, it would be conjointly the Ministry of Power and the Secretary of State for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I say, with respect, this is not what we were debating on the three Amendments. We were debating a somewhat narrower point. In clarifying these points, as I am attempting to do, the hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie), might indicate that he does not wish to persist in seeking more restrictions on this, so that it will give us more time to have a look afresh at these Clauses and clarify the subsequent matters that we have been discussing now which arise when we have disposed of the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dempsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I just want to put one point. In Coatbridge we have derelict railway sidings.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dempsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, for fertiliser, for example—which is offensive from the point of view of amenity, what protection have the local people and the local council got, planning wise, against such a plan?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I told my hon. Friend, what one does in these circumstances is to make representations to the local planning authority which has got to be consulted anyway, and it would advertise this development, whatever it was, and no matter which Ministry or Ministries were the sponsoring Government Department as distinct from a nationalised body, and to that proposal there would be objections from the offended residents. This would be the case for the local planning authority to decide whether or not an inquiry should be held, and the nature of it. In other words, they are not exempt
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>562</span>
from this. They have got to go through the hoops of this, and they have got to get assent from the Secretary of State for this development. We are discussing here the history of operational and non-operational land, the modifications that we are making to it in this Bill, the effect of its transference from one authority to another, and the relevance of the last Amendment proposed by the Opposition in relation to the transference of operational land to different bodies. I hope that the hon. and learned Gentleman will agree with me that the three Amendments he is proposing ought not to be made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These Amendments, which were put down by my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) and myself, were really to draw the Committee's attention to the position of statutory undertakers, and I think we have succeeded in doing that. It is something the Committee should think about. We had in mind the possibility of restricting their powers further than they are restricted in the existing Clause. They are not Amendments which we would seek to press. The purpose of the Amendments was to draw attention to the whole position of statutory undertakers who circumvent the local planning authority's jurisdiction, and that is something we have to watch.

make. It appears that the provisions of Schedule 5 to the 1947 Act, which apply at the moment, presumably, to operational land, are now being extended to non-operational land provided that certain criteria are satisfied. These are set out in subsection (2), namely, that an interest in the land in question is held with a view to its being used for the purposes of carrying on the undertaking—and by that I assume is meant that, although it is non-operational land at the moment, one day it will be operational land—or that it is land in which it is proposed to acquire an interest with a view to its being so used. Thus, (	<i>b</i>) is even more remote from the operational character than (	<i>a</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is the situation, and if this is an extension of the provisions of Schedule 5, the provisions which allow the Secretary of State or the appropriate Minister as planning authority are being applied to non-operational land in these circumstances? Why is that necessary? Why is it not possible to wait until the land has been acquired? Why, in other words, is it necessary to do it in advance? This is part of our concern about the position of statutory undertakers. We want to be satisfied that we shall not give them more privileges than those they already possess.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not disagree with the hon. and learned Gentleman's analysis of the position as it stands and as it will be under the Clause. On Clause 68, we discussed non-operational lands which will come within the ambit of Clause 68 and 69. The general intention is that, in future, land cannot become operational unless the planning implications of its proposed use have been explored and evaluated before any effective decision is made. This is why we refer to Ministers; it could be two Ministers. It could be the Secretary of State in his dual capacity, but it could be two separate Ministers, one, the Secretary of State assessing its planning value in his planning capacity, the other the Minister exercising his duty as the sponsoring Minister in respect of the Ministry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, this new provision does not apply to all non-operational land; it applies only because of subsection (2) to land which the operators already hold or
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>564</span>
propose to acquire with a view to its becoming operational. This is land which in almost all respects should be considered from the operational point of view and in consideration of which the views of the appropriate Minister are of special significance. I hope that we shall leave these two subsections as they stand, because they qualify to some extent the position of operational land, and they also give the joint Minister his appropriate position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is correct that two Ministers are involved; that is clear from Schedule 5. But Schedule 5 deals with operational land. But we are being asked to extend the provisions of Schedule 5 to land which is not operational. I wonder why. After all, what we are doing here all the time is cutting out the local planning authority; we are making the Secretary of State the planning authority for statutory undertakers, in consultation and co-operation with another Minister. This is something which we must watch. I shall not press the point, because this whole section on statutory undertakers, like other parts of the Bill, could take up a lot of our time. I am not at all happy about the treatment which the Bill has had in Committee. We have not had time to deal with it properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why is it necessary to extend the provisions of Schedule 5 of the 1947 Act to non-operational land? This is a new step, and there must be a reason for it. I want the Minister of State to tell us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, we have had our debate on Amendments Nos. 192, 193 and 194. I referred specifically, towards the end, to what would happen if we were to adopt Amendment No. 194. What would happen is that we should not allow a statutory undertaker who succeeded another statutory undertaker to treat as operational land which was taken over by that statutory undertaker. Lest it was thought to be an abstract argument, I cited the case of the National Freight Corporation and the recently established Scottish Transport Group, with specific reference to the rights and liabilities of the Scottish Bus Group, as it used to be, and of the Caledonian Steam Packet Company as it still is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Partly in order to preserve the position of succeeding statutory undertakers, we

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>565</span>
do not want to limit this. We debated the question on Clause 68. If we have subsection (2) in the Bill, it qualifies the land which is in the category of becoming operational, where previously it was not operational, because it is land which the undertakers hold already or propose to acquire with a view to its becoming operational, whether it be transferred to another statutory undertaker or not.

We have had representations from the Town Planning Institute and from Glasgow Corporation that this definition by itself could cause difficulties.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has been reduced because the three-months period has created difficulties for developers, including local authorities.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to know in what way the House of Commons Disqualification Act 1957 is amended, and what the general effect of subsection (3) is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend was unfortunate enough to miss part of our exciting discussion on Clause 60, the planning inquiry commissions. I admit that that was one of the very few occasions when my right hon. Friend was absent. I explained in considerable detail why we thought unwise to have Members of Parliament too involved here, not just on grounds of remuneration, which in itself, as an office of profit, would disqualify, but on other grounds as well. I have no doubt that my right hon. Friend, with his usual conscientiousness, will want to read that small part of today's proceedings which he missed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect to my hon. Friend, I happened to be here for the discussion on Clause 60. I am glad to have it verified that I was so unnoticeable. But I still do not understand why, because we appoint a planning inquiry commission, or the Secretary of State does, we should exclude the provision which says that the Bill shall extend only to Scotland. Surely, he would not appoint Members of Parliament from Mauritius or somewhere to the planning inquiry commission? I should have thought it was entirely a Scottish matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an interesting constitutional point, but, with respect, it is not disqualification of Scottish Members of Parliament from these planning inquiry commissions; it is disqualification of all Members of the United Kingdom House of Commons from planning inquiry commissions.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I heard my hon. Friend explain the reasons why. I think I see

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>571</span>
the point, but I am bound to say that I cannot visualise a Secretary of State who valued his position much appointing Members for Brighton or Southampton to a Scottish inquiry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, it might be argued that they could be brought on for their technical expertise. But still one comes back to the basic argument on House of Commons disqualification. It is an office of profit under the Crown. This is a classic constitutional principle, which my right hon. Friend has always endorsed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, I endorse it, and I congratulate my hon. Friend on the way in which he has dealt with a difficult technical and highly constitutional point, which could have developed into a very learned argument. I am glad to say that it has not, and I congratulate him on the way in which he dealt with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the Minister of State, but have the Government considered that there are today a great number of people who are excluded from standing for Parliament or, if they are Members, have to cease being Members if they take up these jobs? The list is frighteningly long. Would the Minister be kind enough to take it up with his superiors and see if the process can be halted? Our aim should be that almost anybody in the United Kingdom may stand for Parliament and become a Member if he or she so wishes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could my hon. Friend explain why English Members are to be disqualified, and why there should be any question of an English Member sitting on a Scottish planning inquiry commission?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that all Members of the United Kingdom Parliament—not just Englishmen representing Scottish constituencies, or Welshmen representing Scottish constituencies, but Englishmen representing English constituencies or any permutation thereof—are excluded. Tempted as I am to accept the invitation to discuss this entire constitutional doctrine with my colleagues, I think that we have more urgent business to settle than to seek revision of a classic, constitutional doctrine. There is no short-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>572</span>
age of candidates to be Members of Parliament, so far as I am aware, and I do not think that I could, on a planning Bill, promise to reopen a great issue like that. As long as the formulation of constitutional policy is as it is, it is only proper that we should adopt it in this Bill, in our usual Scottish self-sacrificing way. I commend that to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dempsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One question still bothers me. How does the office of profit under the Crown arise for Members? If they get travelling expenses or a lunch allowance, might that make it an office of profit? If so, I should like my hon. Friend to explain why it is that in the Secretary of State for Scotland's hospital services M.P.s can be members of the management committees, on the Western Hospitals Regional Board and the Eastern Hospitals Regional Board, as they are in England and Wales and draw these expenses. Yet that does not seem to be regarded as an office of profit under the Crown. I am not trying to be difficult, but I am keen on my hon. Friend explaining this constitutional point which is clear to my right hon. Friend but complex and complicated to me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Am I right in thinking that this is really a United Kingdom Bill with the exception of Clauses 1 to 105 and Clause 160(1), (2) and (4)?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.0 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a Scottish Bill. The point the hon. and learned Member was trying to emphasise and which I have unsuccessfully tried to emphasise is that the basic Act, and I say this directly to my hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge and Airdrie (Mr. Dempsey), the 1957 Disqualification Act, has to be read in its application to the Bill. My hon. Friend would understand the principle if he did that. Clause 60(3) says:
	<br><q><p>"The Secretary of State may pay to the members of any such commission such remuneration and allowances as he may with the consent of the Treasury determine."</p></q>

	<div class='clause'>New Clause No. 1</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>PLANNING APPLICATIONS</div> <!-- title -->
	<br><q><p>Where any application is made to the local planning authority for planning permission under section 12 of the Act of 1947 the authority shall not proceed to consider the application until they are satisfied that adequate publicity has been given to the application and that persons who may be expected to desire an opportunity of making representations to the authority are made aware that they are entitled to an opportunity of doing so and are given adequate opportunity of making such representations.—[	<i>Mr. Wylie.</i>]</p></q>
	<p>	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the Clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the Clause is to try to get over the practical difficulty with which all hon. Members are familiar when an application is made for planning permission under Section 12 and permission is granted without anyone with an interest in objecting to the application knowing anything about it. There is no problem if the application is refused, because that is either the end of the matter, or the applicant appeals. When the applicant appeals, the Secreary of State holds a public inquiry under Section 14, publication is made and everybody knows about it, and people may say why they think the appeal should be refused.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the problem arises, and it has arisen in my own personal experience as a Member of Parliament more than once, when consent is granted, and it is only when the dean of guild application comes along that people get to know about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) is obviously familiar with this problem. It is a difficult problem, because there are many such applications, and no doubt only a minority of them give offence to adjoining proprietors. But I should like to think that it is not beyond the wit of the Committee to devise some means whereby we can get round that difficulty without overloading the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not suggest that the Clause as drafted is the right answer; I am that sure there are defects in it. The Minister is aware of this problem, because I remember his pointing out the nature of this problem to my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) in discussion on earlier Clauses. I should like to think that it
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>574</span>
would be possible to get some provision whereby people would know about these applications before it was too late for them to do anything about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman has raised an important subject. I am not sure whether it covers the case raised earlier by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) in regard to the change of use, for example, to a launderette. I think that it does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been considerable trouble in my constituency where people living above a launderette have not been aware of the change of use—which must have been approved by the town council—until receiving a dean of guild notice telling them that certain things were being done down below. This seems wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that some of the chemicals used in a launderette would be offensive to people living above, quite apart from the noise. There has been considerable bother in my constituency about this matter, as well as trouble with other planning applications about which neighbouring people knew nothing until receipt of the dean of guild notice, by which time it was practically too late to do anything about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The dean of guild is not concerned with the fact that the change of use has been approved. Quite rightly, his only concern is with the fact that whatever is done has been done in accordance with the rules and regulations, after which it gets the approval of the dean of guild court. This raises a number of problems, particularly in urban areas, and whether the Clause is right or wrong I think that the hon. and learned Gentleman has raised an issue which should receive consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clark Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) and the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis). There is a difficulty when people do not know what is happening or what is proposed. Whether the Clause be right or wrong, if the Minister can do something to ensure that the general public is kept informed, he will earn the gratitude of many people, not only in Edinburgh, but throughout Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1128">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>575</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not unaware of the immense challenge offered here. I accept the view of the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) that the Clause itself would not quite achieve that object, or rather that it would achieve it in an extraordinarily expensive way that would entirely overburden the machine. It would require us to produce the same publicity—no doubt we could have an argument about adequate publicity—for every planning application in Scotland. I have tried to work out with my advisers how many would escape this, but the intention of the Clause is that no one should escape.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The number of planning applications in Scotland is now running at 22,500 a year. The Committee should pause and think what that would mean. I accept the analogy of the proposals regarding building regulations; but the relationship there is straightforward. I may be affected by a neighbour's dividing wall, or by some other structure common to us both. The relevance of physical contact is beyond dispute. But planning involves not just one's next-door neighbour, but all one's neighbours, whether immediate or not. Thus, the undisguised intention of the Clause is to deal not with immediate neighbours, but with everybody involved. It states that adequate publicity must be given to the application, so that all persons entitled shall have the opportunity to make representations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say this not to attack the Clause, but to embarrass myself, as well as the hon. and learned Member for Pentlands. If we were to make the simple condition that we advertised in newspapers every planning application, this would mean that in the City of Glasgow alone 100 advertisements would have to be placed every week. Were all these advertisements placed, it would be difficult to remember to read them and to spot the big ones. I am not saying that it is a case of "When everyone is somebody, no one is anybody", but the papers would be deluged. A small advertisement for selling one's house would cost approximately £4, which, multiplied 22,500 times, represents a large sum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Advertising in a newspaper could be said to be inadequate publicity. In our earlier discussions we regarded it as the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>576</span>
minimum publicity. Other things were to be done, too, but this had to be done. We are adding about £1 million to the advertising revenue of newspapers on that alone. I think that I am entitled to rehearse arguments which I have had thrust upon me. I am not unsympathetic toward this proposal, but it is difficult to find the right means without overloading the machine or putting considerable undue expense, upon the ratepayer and taxpayer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In my own experience most difficulties arise with neighbours. I cannot for the life of me see why a change of use, or something of that kind, cannot be notified to neighbours in the same way as a dean of guild court notice is given. This applies not only to the house next door. I get dean of guild court notices if a garage is built at the end of my garden to ask what objections I have. If this can be done by the dean of guild court, why cannot it be done by a planning committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Instead of putting the onus on a planning authority, could not the onus not be placed on the applicant to get the consent of his neighbour before submitting his application?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I receive many representations from my constituents on this very issue. It is a major problem. I appreciate the difficulties, but I am not sure that the right hon. Gentleman is not getting rather nearer to the mark when he says that the onus should be on the applicant to do something—to wave a cap, or hang a blue towel out of his window, something which will show that he had submitted a planning application. Those of his neighbours who did not usually see a blue towel hanging out of his window would call to see why it was there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are terrible complications, but I am sure that our combined wisdom should provide some solution to the problem, perhaps before Report. I should be most grateful if the Minister would give some indication that he would at least try to do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was in the middle of trying to explain my position. I do not think that the "blue towel" idea is very good. I do not mean that I would advocate a red towel—I say that with
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1129">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>577</span>
some regret. The other two suggestions are sensible and I will certainly consider them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will not disguise from the Committee the fact that people will insist that it is more than simply the application of the dean of guild parallel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Opposition will declare that they do not insist on the Clause—and I accept that they are moving it only as a peg for argument—and if they are prepared to limit the wording—
	<br><q><p>"… that persons who may be expected to desire an opportunity of making representations"—</p></q>
and will not slap me in the teeth on Report for not doing it properly, I will consider something for Report. This would be a major retreat from those critics of the present situation who want us to tell everybody. It just is not possible to tell everybody.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the moment we have what we call bad neighbour types of planning application, and we prescribe these. The list as it stands under paragraph 8 of the 1959 General Development Order includes public conveniences, disposal of refuse or waste, sewage disposal, slaughterhouses, theatres, cinemas, music halls, dance halls, skating rinks, swimming baths, Turkish baths, gymnasiums and buildings for indoor games. I have no doubt that we could add launderettes. I am not saying that we will, but we could look at that and at ice cream parlours, or some of the other examples given earlier, as being cases where bad neighbour types of application should go through certain additional procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the way we practise it, which is not to take the generality of applications, but to take specific categories and make them go through special hoops which involve their immediate neighbours and others. This meets the general point of the new Clause. It goes further than neighbours. The noble Lord was told earlier on—I cannot remember whether he said it himself—that he was not concerned just simply with a house in the New Town, or even a street in the New Town, but the whole New Town. It might be argued that the change of use, or seeking planning permission for establishing one of these, was of concern to everyone in the New Town. So we are
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>578</span>
back where we started. This defeats the attempt to circumscribe the number of people who would get this individual form of notice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Skeffington Report is about development planning and not about development control. It is bound to say something on this. I do not know what recommendations it may give us, but it could, for example, be desirable to ask local planning authorities to apply the site notice requirements in Clause 75 of the Bill. If the Committee look back at that they will see these at present apply only to Section 55 applications which affect us under the list I gave to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a very difficult matter. It is not one that we can simply resolve by putting in a Clause of this kind. It has got to be a very clearly thought out Clause. It might, for that matter, be easier to achieve this by administrative means or a combination of both. In short, I cannot promise to the Committee a definite addition to the Bill on Report to meet this point. I will certainly try. I will certainly have a look. I will certainly see what I can do, either using legislative or administrative means. If the hon. and learned Member is thirled to this idea, and I have touched on it again myself to strengthen the position, I hope he will say so. If he is not, if he is prepared to make a big concession on this and let us bring it closer to the parallel of dean of guild and abandon the generality, if he is prepared to do that, I am certainly prepared to have a look at it in that context.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Personally, I think that my hon. Friend is being very forthcoming about this. He recognises there is a difficulty. To have a house that one could live in without being surrounded by noise, smells and all this kind of thing is just as important as having a house which is not being damaged by somebody making alterations next door. I can see that he recognises this. I am quite happy myself to accept his undertaking that he will look at this. I think that is a fair offer, because anybody who knows anything about it knows this is a difficult problem, and ought to be tackled in the interests of the citizens. I am quite sure that my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also am prepared to make concessions to the Minister, because I know the difficulties. I suggest to him that, perhaps, we could work it not only by what is proposed—whether it is ice-cream parlours or launderettes or anything else. That is one way. The other way is to notify everybody within a certain radius of what is proposed; it may be 200 yards, whatever figure is considered suitable. All I ask is that the Minister look into this carefully. I think he sees the point, and I shall back him if he really gets down to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the case of dean of guild notices, my experience is that I receive notices for things done to houses four and five houses away; in the same half of the street, I receive notices from the dean of guild. That is what makes me think that this is probably a better approach.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We must be careful to protect the people who want the launderettes. After all, they have been a great labour-saving help to housewives throughout the whole community. The idea that a few people who can afford to buy expensive washing machines will be able to deny the rest of the people the use of a launderette is intolerable. I see no reason why it should not be possible for the applicant to obtain a list of supporters for the launderette and find out whether there are any objectors. I think that the idea of a towel is a very good one—two towels, a dirty one and a clean one. That is what happens at a launderette.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I never mentioned launderettes, so I hope that the observation about washing machines was not directed at me. Obviously, this new Clause was not intended to stick. It was drawn mainly from earlier provisions relating to structure plans and local plans, and one' would not expect that kind of intimation to be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with what has been said. The right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis), coming to my assistance, as he has done so often on this Bill, made clear that there is a real problem here and that it applies to the people round about. I know the argument that certain developments can affect people in a wider area, but the real problem has been
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>580</span>
neighbours round about. In my case, I live not opposite a launderette but opposite a house which has had a change of use and is now an office. I am not criticising the people concerned; they have to do their jobs, and they do them, on the whole, very well. But it does not improve the amenity of the area in which it is done. This is the kind of thing which one wants to know about before it happens, because after it has happened it is too late to do anything about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the hon. and learned Gentleman a question? My right hon. Friend said that a number of neighbours had notice in respect of building. In law, he is entitled as a neighbour, but he may have had these notices gratuitously, as an act of grace by the proposer. But would the hon. and learned Gentleman say, "We only want this to apply to the immediate neighbour, as in building regulations, as in dean of guild court procedures"? Before he dismisses the general argument, would he go a stage beyond that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend did not clarify his position. He is in the fortunate position of receiving what lots of people in Scotland do not receive; he has more than his legal rights under the dean of guild court procedure. I ask the hon. and learned Gentleman to apply his mind to is this: if we are dismissing the generality, where do we draw the line? If we are to cover more than the immediate neighbours, what is the middle group?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not easy. I think that the immediate neighbours are at the core of the problem. Some form of intimation to immediate neighbours would go three-quarters of the way to resolving it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conversely, one cannot include the generality, because what would be gained out of that would be entirely disproportionate to the losses involved. This approach might have some bearing on it as well. It might be useful. I should be content if we could find a way of invoking the dean of guild intimation procedure for planning applications. That would solve at least three-quarters of the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the Minister for his reply. He is taking this problem seriously. We are dealing with the first major planning Bill since 1947 and it

	<br><q><p>Without prejudice to section 12(1) of the Act of 1947 (grant of planning permission unconditionally or subject to conditions), the conditions which may under that subsection be attached to a grant of planning permission relating to sand or gravel workings in a stream shall include conditions with respect to the prevention of—

	<p>9.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Lawson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the Clause be read a Second Time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank you, Mr. Brewis, for calling this new Clause, although it is still starred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question with which I now propose to deal is a matter that has disturbed me over many years and it disturbs many people in the Lanarkshire area. There must be similar problems in other parts of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a difficulty, which I recognise, of how to deal with this question. What are called wet workings of sand and gravel require planning permission. As planning permission is required it seems right that it should be dealt with as we are now dealing with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the doubt whether this problem might be more effectively dealt with under regulations dealing with river pollution. There is a difficulty in respect of Scotland in this matter in that we have river purification boards and in the past I have sought to have something done through the river purification board covering the Clyde, but it seems that the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>582</span>
powers of river purification boards in scotland are limited. They are limited in. that they can deal with matter that is put into a river, but not so easily with matter already there, with the pollution that can come from the stirring up of a river bed or the destruction of a river bed. I understand that in England and wales the situation is different. River boards in England and Wales are conservation boards, much more concerned with the conservation and the supply of water. In Scotland they are concerned only with purification. That is the problem, and I am not sure that the new Clause would provide an adequate means of dealing with it. I want the prohibition, except under stringent conditions, of the extraction of sand and gravel from river beds, but at this stage we are asking for something more modest, that a planning authority should take account of the items listed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph (	<i>a</i>) refers to pollution in the stream. There is no doubt that where there are these workings—and I have photographs available for any hon. Member who wishes to see them—dredging up the sand and the gravel from the river bed, there is severe discolouration of the water itself, often over long distances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not profess to be an angler, but am informed that when a river is discoloured as if it were in winter spate, it destroys any opportunity of angling, because fish will not come up. When the weather is just ideal, anglers may come from long distances to the upper reaches of the Clyde expecting excellent conditions for fishing only to find that this discolouration destroys the possibility of fishing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the fine silt which fills the river can be destructive to river life. It is, for example, destructive of the larvae upon which so much life depends. The fry itself is destroyed by this fine silt and if we think of the activities which have gone on for years by such groups as the United Clyde Anglers, who have reared thousands of fry, we realise the extent of damage being done. Young fish have been turned into the river often to be slaughtered in their thousands by running into a patch of pollution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even when the planning authority tries to insist upon sufficient protection, time after time that protection is broken down
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1132">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>583</span>
and large areas of the river are choked. The effort put in over the whole year to keep the river suitable for trout fishing is destroyed in this way. I am assured this has happened time after time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a newspaper cutting dated 8th December which talks of the river being polluted for virtually 50 miles because of the breaking down of one of these barriers. In other places there are no barriers, and yet there is dredging. At one time four dredgers were working in the river bed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Pollution destroys fishing because it starves the river of the food upon which fish would live and is often directly destructive of the young fish themselves. I agree this pollution is not something that has been put into a river but is the result of the bed being turned up in such a way as to become harmful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a letter and copies of correspondence from the Lanarkshire branch of the Scottish National Farmers' Union complaining about the effects of this type of working on good agricultural land. I know that occasionally a farmer will argue in support of some of the things which are being done, but as a union since 1967 farmers have been pressing for steps to be taken to control, not eliminate, the type of activity that has been going on in the Clyde, an activity which, if certain people had their way, would be greatly extended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Interference with the flow of a stream can be serious. Hon. Gentlemen will see from the photographs I have passed round that sections of the Clyde, instead of being a river, have been turned into a dirty looking canal. In many ways it is just a dump through which water flows very slowly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Rivers are the product of thousands, perhaps millions, of years, yet one can destroy them in a matter of months. The bed of the river is destroyed and what was a river of great beauty and a river that has brought much pleasure to men over generations, is being destroyed under our eyes. There is this process of interfering with the flow of the stream and the process of erosion. One has only to look at those pictures to see what is happening to the banks, and we have plenty of illustrations, in different parts of the water, of this type of process—the breaking-down of banks leading to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>584</span>
destruction. I heard how in another area this type of erosion had actually brought a bridge down—unforeseen when permission to abstract was given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, there is disturbance to the ecology of the area in which the stream is situated. I put it to this Committee that we are here dealing with an interest that is all too seldom represented. It certainly does not have a powerful voice to put its case. When some clearly-defined property interest is at stake, there are plenty of voices to speak for it. When we are thinking in terms of changes in the balance of nature, most of us do not detect these things until too late. It is this type of thing with which we are here concerned. Only a handful of people know anything about it. Only a handful of people are moved. In this instance many anglers see their sport being destroyed and they are concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a lengthy report of an inquiry carried out under the auspices of the river purification board. It makes the point that if these works are uncontrolled, the river may be destroyed for all time. The board is concerned with what is happening, but it does not have the power to deal with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must ensure that we enable the protection of rivers such as this. One of the Bill's principal objectives is the improving of our physical environment. A river is an important part of the environment, and this river flows through the industrial centre of Scotland, a river that has been providing until recently about 50 miles of excellent brown trout fishing. It is in serious jeopardy unless steps are taken to protect it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I want and what the anglers and most nature-lovers of the area want is the prohibition of sand and gravel extraction. I understand that there are plenty of sand and gravel in the area. I understand, too, that if sand and gravel run short, there is plenty of whin rock that may be used for the purpose and would be better than sand and gravel. The crushing would cost a bit more, but there should be no lack of material.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Committee will support me. The diffused and weak interests of a mass of individual anglers and nature-lovers must not be sacrificed to the powerful lobbying that can often be produced to argue that we need cheap
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1133">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>585</span>
sand and gravel. There is, I understand, plenty of sand and gravel to be obtained—and, if not sand and gravel, other materials.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But even if there were not plenty of other sand and gravel to be obtained, a river such as this cannot be duplicated. We cannot and ought not to allow the destruction of rivers such as this. The river is something that is not ours. It is something that belongs to nobody—to no individual. Even the man who says—"I own the land", cannot say that this is his. It is something that our people have inherited from ages back, and we should be passing it on. We have a duty to find sufficient means of protecting his river, and any like river in Scotland that happens to be threatened in the same way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to have the opportunity once again of getting back to my own side and supporting one of my hon. Friends who, once again, has held the Committee by his eloquence. He carried me back to the days when he described most graphically to us those tramps of his beside the fast-running streams, with a knapsack upon his back—and the beer cans in the knapsack. I remember that speech—in fact it is one of the few speeches of the Committee that I do remember—and I think tonight that he has once again shown the same form, the same love of the countryside, and the same desire to protect it against those who would ravage and despoil it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am all on his side. What he says is first-class. This is what we should do. We should not allow this beautiful Scotland to be despoiled in the interests of profit, and sheer material benefit and gain. This is a heritage which we should cherish. If anything can be done in this Bill to enable us to hand on this heritage in a fitting manner, we ought to take the opportunity of doing so. I do not want to try to vie with my hon. Friend in his eloquence. I only say, very humbly, as one who has sat at his feet often and has listened to his words of wisdom, that I support this Clause 100 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend will be very forthcoming, and give us hope that at least we shall take a step, an important step, in the preservation of our rivers. When we look around our environment and see what we have done to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>586</span>
our rivers, we ought to sink our heads in shame. We have fouled them. We have clumbered them up with every kind of thing. In many cases, we have prevented ordinary folk from getting near them. I get rather angry when I think about it. Even if my hon. Friend cannot accept this new Clause, I hope that he will at least hold out some hope that the depredations of the sand grabbers will be controlled in a fit and proper manner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: None of us who has sat through these long proceedings ever dreamt that it would finish in an outburst of poetry from two of our colleagues. I am quite sure that as my hon. Friend the Member for Motherwell (Mr. Lawson) was speaking that we all thought that this was the real song of the Clyde. I am quite sure that it has inspired us all to press the Minister to solve this burning problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dempsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As one of the Lanarkshire Members I would like also to support the plea of my hon. Friend the Member for Motherwell (Mr. Lawson). Like himself, I have been supplied with a great deal of the correspondence to which he referred. But quite apart from that, I happen to be one of these outdoor boys; one of the nature lovers. I can openly boast that I have stood over the Clyde where it can be bridged with one's two legs, and followed it from its source right down. This was a different Clyde from that which my hon. Friend can remember—it was a beautiful Clyde.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a cyclist, I have drunk many times from the good, clear, fresh water of the Clyde—in the same area where the anglers were stocking the river. They have done so faithfully year after year. I have known them to stock the river with a few thousand fish, which were dead before they reached Wishaw. That was a shocking state of affairs, because we had a certain degree of planning legislation, together with certain controls. Some people complain that there are too many controls, but in this case there were too few controls.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That beautiful stretch of the Clyde—what we call the Upper Waters of Lanarkshire—has been almost desecrated in certain parts by the sand and gravel workings. I cannot understand why it is allowed, since the Clyde is the only
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1134">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>587</span>
river which runs through Lanarkshire. It is not a wide river in certain places, and it is something one wishes to see preserved. The angling society has done a terrific job, not only in trying to keep the place tidy and stocking the river. but in encouraging young people to leave the street corners and cafes and get out into the country to broaden their knowledge of nature study and nature preservation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These anglers do a terrific job of work, and it is all a labour of love. The least we can do is to try to strengthen the existing planning legislation. It must be weak to permit this type of development instead of seeking to preserve a river which has earned so much fame throughout the world, and which, as an end product, builds the most magnificent ships to sail the oceans of the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister cannot accept the new Clause perhaps he can at least make a simple declaration of intent that he will strengthen the planning legislation in order to prohibit the workings of sand and gravel in this beautiful river; workings which spoil some of the nicest stretches of country, especially in Lanarkshire. Within a stone's throw we have one of the most famous, useful and appreciated quarries producing the red whin. The Clyde tumbles its way at the foot of that quarry. There is no need or justification for those workings there. I hope that we shall hear from my hon. Friend that he agrees in principle with the new Clause, and that he intends to ensure on Report that some legislation will be introduced to strengthen planning controls.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: After these four speeches I find it difficult to respond. My hon. Friend the Member for Motherwell (Mr. Lawson), in addition to being a poet, is also an intellectual, and I intend to appeal now to his intellectual instincts. A Minister must find a practical way out of these difficulties, rather than accept principles which could not be put into practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only one of the four requirements in the new Clause is a planning matter, strictly speaking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first one concerns pollution, and he was good enough to refer to that. The question arises whether this question should fall within the river purification
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>588</span>
legislation. The River Purification Board has demonstrated an interest in this matter. So far as I am aware, the only real problem that is presented to our Department is the problem in Lanarkshire. If there are other problems in Scotland I am not aware of them. They have not been brought to our attention. Therefore, what I have to say concerns Lanarkshire. At first sight the problem there is very serious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first point in the new Clause concerns river purification. The second point is not an aspect of land use. My hon. Friend was right in saying that it affects fishing interests. It is certainly a possible matter for fishing legislation. I readily admit that paragraph (	<i>c</i>) is, without doubt or qualification, a planning matter, and I shall come back to that in a moment. Paragraph (	<i>d</i>) concerns fish life, referring to
	<br><q><p>"disturbance to the ecology of the area"</p></q>
bird life and plant life, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are not planning matters; they concern the preservation of the countryside and natural life. I say this because we are dealing with a planning Bill. It would be wrong, in a planning Bill, to seek redress on defects of legislation or absences of legislation in these three other fields. We should correct these things in a proper Bill. There are several possible solutions to the problem, one of which is the simple one of banning it all, but if we want to arrive at a solution which would not ban it, that solution might well be a compendium of the four paragraphs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely my hon. Friend will agree that the long-term restoration of the ecological cycle is part of the aim of all long-term planning. He cannot dismiss the point as simply as that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Restoration is a different thing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg pardon. The restoration of the natural ecological conditions is surely part of long-term planning. Surely this must be in the minds of the Highlands and Islands Development Board, and so on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend that it is long-term planning with a small "p", but it is not long-term planning that is achieved by planning

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>589</span>
legislation. To restore a river one would have to use not only purification legislation but other legislation—fishery legislation certainly, and perhaps other legislation as well. I have not said that there are no planning elements. What I have asked the Committee to agree with me about is that paragraph (	<i>c</i>) is clearly and beyond doubt a planning application of this problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dempsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not the case that the basic principle of granting a planning consent is that it does not injure the area? Surely, dredging a beautiful river and churning up mud and gravel is injuring the amenities. Can we not get at the matter through planning legislation to prohibit that getting through?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was going to say that one would think that if what I have said is true—that paragraph (c) is legitimately a planning matter—the question arises why Lanarkshire County Council has agreed to this. Let us be fair to the county council. Despite what has been said about banning this, and so on, the Ministry of Public Building and Works, as I understand it, has informed us that in West Central Scotland it is quite difficult to get sand and gravel of this quality for the work that is needed in making concrete for roads and houses and many of the other important building programmes that we have in Scotland. We cannot dismiss that and neither has the Lanarkshire County Council. It has tried. It contends that it has made full use of its planning powers to control whatever sand and gravel workings it permits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We understand that there is a shortage of this material. It may be said, "This is not good enough. We must haul it: in from somewhere else." This matter is beyond the authority of the county council. Therefore, I do not seek to blame it in any way—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] Would my hon. Friends oblige me by letting me deploy my points? They can then savage me later on. All that is happening is that I am making a fragmented attempt to make some points. I. have given the Committee the view of the Lanarkshire County Council on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dempsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot accept that on a matter of principle. We have ample sand quarries in Lanarkshire. We have
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>590</span>
been using them for years. I intervene only to give the Minister some additional information. Obviously this is the opportunity of a lifetime!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lawson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I realise that this is a very important point, and I do not want it to be thought that I am blaming Lanarkshire County Council. I know that it is now doing its utmost to prevent this development by refusing to grant additional facilities. It is under enormous pressure, and I am concerned With finding some way of alleviating that pressure and putting river operations on a sound basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.0 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On no account does a Minister dismiss advice given by a friendly Ministry which is trying to help one with one's building programmes. It may be that the advice is wrong, but the fact remains that this is the advice that has been given to us. We are talking of a certain quality of sand and gravel. We are not talking about any deposit of sand or gravel, but certain qualities of sand and gravel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not competent to go into this argument nor in detail—nor, I am sure, would the Committee want to hear it tonight. I simply say that the Lanarkshire County Council has tried, within the full use of its planning powers, to allow this to go on to a certain extent. It is concerned about this matter. I am not saying that the county council has not used its planning powers to their full extent. It is not something which can be cured simply by planning powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is argued that even river pollution legislation would not cover this point because disturbing the sand and gravel does not constitute pollution, in the legal sense. I accept my hon. Friend's point—although I am not an angler myself—that disturbing the sand and gravel destroys the angling. I accept that that may be so, but that is not pollution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We come back to the problem of fisheries. I suggest that both the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Scottish Development Department are concerned about this. In view of all the correspondence that has gone on about this matter, and the fact that everybody is trying to act in good faith, operating the existing legislation—and since nobody can give us a definitive

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>591</span>
recommendation as to how to meet this problem—I propose that we should have a meeting of the two Departments representing the fisheries and the building and planning sides on the one hand, and the River Purification Board, the local authorities and angling and farming organisations on the other, together with those Members of Parliament for Lanarkshire who have had correspondence about this, or who are concerned about it. Obviously that includes my hon. Friend and my right hon. Friend the Member for Lanark (Mrs. Hart) and the hon. Member for Coatbridge and Airdrie, who has spoken up tonight for his constituency. Other Lanarkshire Members may be affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I propose that we should have that meeting. I hope that it will be held in St. Andrews House. I cannot commit either my noble Friend or myself to this, but it will have to be soon. Therefore, I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Motherwell (Mr. Lawson) will be good enough to accept our good faith. If he will withdraw this new Clause, we shall hold this meeting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He will realise the immense problems which exist in trying to reconcile all these interests. My hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge and Airdrie can ventilate the point which he has made about sand and gravel and any other matter which he wants to raise. That is the best way of dealing with it, and on Report or at some other stage in the legislative process, we can see whether we are able to deal with this matter in the best way possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

If there were rather less of it and rather fewer concrete buildings, I should be quite pleased. But the point is that there are many concrete buildings in London, all over England and elsewhere, and I must ask, where has that sand and gravel come from? Why is there something special about the Clyde which means that it must be used in Scotland only? There is some faulty reasoning, and I am far from convinced that this sand and gravel is all that

It has been drawn to my attention by the Georgian Society that this is a matter
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>594</span>
which causes them some concern. I should be most grateful if, in the course of my probing, the Minister of State could give me some explanation as to the kind of circumstance in which the Secretary of State can apparently opt out of his duties with regard to making decisions on applications sent in to him.

I should like to assure the Committee that for the present it is not intended to make any exemptions, but we think it desirable that the power should exist, since experience may well show that it is unnecessary for all the applications to be notified to the Secretary of State.

I put down this Amendment simply because I was anxious to discover whether compensation which would be paid would, in fact, be in full and would not simply be nominal compensation. This is a lawyer's point, and I should be grateful for the Minister's indication on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Paragraph 10 of the Fourth Schedule provides for compensation being paid for abortive expenditure caused by revocation or modification of a listed building consent, or for loss or damage directly attributable to the revocation or modification. This paragraph reflects the provisions of Section 20 of the 1947 Act, which deals with compensation in the case of revocation or modification of planning permission. If there is any dispute about the amount of compensation, this will be a matter for the arbiter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we included the words of the Amendment we should throw some doubt on the time-tested provisions of the 1947 Act. The court, for example, would be led to look for a difference between compensation under Section 20 and compensation in full under this provision—a difference which, in essence, should not exist. The addition could only confuse the court in deciding the matter. I hope that the noble Lord follows me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Sub-paragraph (7) provides that he may, in confirming a notice, modify it by substituting another local planning authority or statutory undertaker for the authority on whom the notice was served.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of both these Amendments is to remedy two defects in Section 17 of the 1947 Act as amended by Schedule 9 of the 1959 Act. Section 17, the Committee will recall, deals with purchase notices. These defects have come to light in the practical operation of the Section. Perhaps I ought not to omit a full explanation of this, since I think it is worthy of the record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 17 operates where land has become useless to its owner in its existing state and he cannot get any planning permission that would enable him to use it. In such circumstances, he can serve
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1140">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>599</span>
a purchase notice calling on the planning authority to buy the land. The Section lays down the conditions that must be satisfied and the procedure to be followed. The defects are in the procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first is that if the planning authority takes no action with regard to the purchase notice—and we have already discussed this matter to some extent—the procedure is thrown out of gear. The effective result is that a further six months must elapse during which no one can take any action at all and then the purchase notice stands confirmed. The first Amendment would cure this by providing that if the planning authority fails in its duty, the purchase notice stands confirmed at the end of the first three months. This Amendment is carried out by sub-paragraphs (	<i>a</i>), (	<i>b</i>) and (	<i>c</i>) of paragraph 12 of Schedule 8 and the Amendment made to Schedule 10.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second defect which is dealt with in sub-paragraph (	<i>d</i>) of paragraph 12 comes towards the end of the procedure. One of the actions which a local authority can take is to refuse to accept a purchase notice, and I may say that they usually do, and submit the whole question to the Secretary of State. He must then consider it and issue a provisional decision. If any of the parties disputes the provisional decision, it can ask for a public inquiry, and after the public inquiry the Secretary of State can change his provisional decision. But there is no provision for the Secretary of State to change his decision in a case where a public inquiry has not taken place. I think that the Committee will agree that that is not right. Therefore we make this adjustment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This is an Amendment which seeks to clarify the Schedule. The Amendment to sub-paragraph (	<i>b</i>) widens the scope of the provision. Sub-paragraph (	<i>a</i>), as the Committee will recognise, deals with land in general, and sub-paragraph (	<i>b</i>) with cases of land in an area of comprehensive

development which has become land in an action area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As it stands, the person entitled to compensation can opt to be treated either under the old C.D.A. procedure or under the action area in the structure plan which has overtaken it, depending on which way he is better off. It could be argued that the option is only open if the action area is wholly within the new structure plan. Very often this will not be the case, and it would be positively undesirable to do anything to make new plans have to stick to the boundaries of old ones. Consequently, this Amendment makes it clear that the option is available so long as the land is even partly within the structure plan area. I think that is fair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Amendment No. 135 made:</i> In page 125, line 43, at end insert:
	<br><q><p>In section 17(3) the words 'the end of the period specified in subsection (1A) of this section' and the words 'whichever is the earlier'.</p></q></p>
	<p>—[	<i>Dr. Dickson Mabon.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 94, in page 126, line 16, column 3, at end insert 'except subsection (5)'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We really need to have this subsection (5) still. It is intended to retain the provision as amended by Schedule 8(19).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 95, in page 126, line 37, column 3, at end insert:
	<br><q><p>In section 107(4) the words 'the foregoing provisions of'.</p></q>
As the Committee will recognise, Section 107(4) provides:
	<br><q><p>"Any power to make an order conferred by the foregoing provisions this Act"—</p></q>
that is to say, the 1947 Act—
	<br><q><p>"shall include power to amend or revoke that order".</p></q>
This Amendment seeks to apply this provision to the Bill. The purpose of the last Amendment was to apply subsection (5) to the Bill, and so is this to apply Section 107(4), because, as Clause 101(2) of the Bill lays down,
	<br><q><p>"This Act and the Act of 1947 shall have effect as if this Act were part of that Act."</p></q>
The provision made in Section 107(4) of the 1947 Act has to be imported into this Bill.

I realise that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) is a little confused, and I want to assure him that without this we should not have the transitional flow from one to the other that is so necessary to make legislation work until such time as we are able to tidy the whole matter up with a consolidation Measure, which I am sure will be just as interesting as this Bill has been.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was trying to follow the Minister, but he was speaking very quickly. This Amendment means that Section 107(4)—is that of the 1947 Act?—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: —is amended by putting in the words "the foregoing provisions of". Looking at Section 107(4), it does not seem to me to fit in. There is a proviso, of course, but the proviso, I think, probably affects the whole Section and not just subsection (4). Perhaps the Minister will just read out Section 107(4) as amended and perhaps then we might be able to understand it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know why the hon. Member wants me to read it out, because it is absolutely clear what is says. Section 107(4) states:
	<br><q><p>"Any power to make an order conferred by the foregoing provisions of this Act shall include power to amend or revoke that order by a subsequent order made in like manner provided that an order made by the Secretary of State for the purposes of paragraph 5 of Part II of the Third Schedule to this Act shall not be amended or revoked at any time after the appointed day."</p></q>
I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman has the same text as I have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that is what it says.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why is the hon. and learned Gentleman puzzled?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What does Amendment No. 95 do? It reads:
	<br><q><p>"in page 126, line 37, column 3, at end insert—In section 107(4) the words 'the foregoing provisions of'."</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although it may be a little confusing, what is happening is that we are taking this out, not putting this in. Although it does not say so, that is what it means. I said that the effect of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>604</span>
the Amendment would be to apply this provision to the Bill, because these are repeal provisions, so that we have to do this to get the opposite effect. It is what the noble Lord lamented earlier—a kind of double negative, which he does not like, but which, in these circumstances, has to be applied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged for that explanation. I had overlooked, because of the lateness of the hour, the fact that we were dealing with a repealing Schedule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Schedule, as amended, agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Chairman do report the Bill, as amended to the House.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we break up, Mr. Brewis, I must say that we are most obliged to you for the way in which you have presided over our deliberations. We missed you, as you know, for one or two sittings, when we began to speed up, but we quickly adjusted ourselves to our normal pace once you arrived back. We are very grateful for your benign influence over us all. I must express my appreciation to the Opposition for the splendid way in which they have cooperated with us in getting a very important Bill through the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I, on behalf of my hon. Friends, concur in those sentiments. and may I also ask you, Mr. Brewis, to convey to your colleague the hon. Member for Leicester, North-West (Sir B. Janner) our appreciation for the work which he did in your absence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
