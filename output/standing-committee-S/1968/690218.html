<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was making some quiet and reasoned comments at the end of our last Sitting about the Under-Secretary's speech. I wanted to narrow the debate to the real issues. We have narrowed it considerably. No one is seriously arguing that the fees in the fee-paying schools are too great or that large numbers of people who want to send their children there cannot afford to do so. This, indeed, is self-evident. There must be very few people, although there are some, who cannot afford the price of two or three packets of cigarettes a week, which is what the fees amount to. However many free places are available in these schools, we surely agree that they can deal with the small number of people who cannot afford to send their children there——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>242</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Margaret Herbison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The figures quoted continually about the cost of the fees never at any time take into account the cast of what is called the "outwith fee" for those who live, say, in my constituency outside Glasgow. Added to the fees which Glasgow children must pay, anything up to £70 more a year has to be found, which makes a considerable difference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is quite true, and I am sure that the right hon. Lady would also include the sometimes considerable costs of travel, but that is somewhat different from the case of parents living in the areas of local education authorities concerned—Glasgow and Edinburgh, for instance—and that children travel some distance from the country is also an indication of the anxiety of their parents to get them into these schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman distinguish between the case of the family with one child which could easily afford to send him to a fee-paying school—where, he says, the fees are not exceptionally high—and the family with five children which wants to send them all there, but cannot afford to send more than one? Would that not create a division, socially and in every other way, in that family as well as in the outside world?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right, but the comparatively small number affected in that way, or by being unable to afford the fees for even one child, can certainly be covered by the free places. That is why no one has pressed the argument about large numbers of people not being able to afford these schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another argument which has not been pressed is that these schools necessarily have a bad social mix. The right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) accepted that there was a social mix and my hon. Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) detailed the backgrounds—so far as occupation can give a background—of a large section of the children at these schools. Therefore, there is a good social mix and there is no question of social background being taken into account in the examination for entrance. Indeed, my information—although this cannot be proved—is that, if a poor social
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0583">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>243</span>
background is known, this tends to bias the examining committee in favour of the child rather than against him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third argument mentioned by the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East was the theory that those who attended these schools have a sort of ticket for life. He described it as an old school tie——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A social cachet, yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: —which would enable them to get jobs and so on. Where has the right hon. Gentleman been in the world of industry? If anyone thinks that he can brandish an old school tie at an employer and get a job, he is sadly out of touch. There is no better way of not being selected. I have interviewed many people for jobs and been interviewed myself, and what stands out from both sides of the interviewing table is the best way to a refusal is to try waving an old school tie——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should live in Edinburgh for a few years and he would then learn some of the facts of life in this respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not only have I been closely connected with Edinburgh for many years, but one side of my family comes from the city, so I do know about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member should live there a few years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Another consideration is more important and makes all question of old school tie out of date. An employer wants to know not the school an applicant went to but how many O grade examinations he has passed, whether he has his Highers and has been to a university and got a degree. It is right that he should know, since these are the qualifications for the job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How can we narrow down the argument? First, the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East—I am sorry to keep referring to him, but he made an interesting speech—said that there is no choice for parents now, or that there is so little that it is not worth having. It is a strange argument, from people who are going to remove the last bit of choice, that this will make the choice wider rather than less wide. A parent with a child who
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>244</span>
is reasonably good academically, likely to be a worker by brain rather than by hand, with an ability to learn the beginnings of reading and writing quickly, may not have a great chance of getting that child into a fee-paying school, but he has a chance. At least he can try, and in some cases succeed. In future, he can have no choice. He will just have to send his child where the education authority says and nowhere else. We must recognise that, whatever its good or bad points, this change will have one inevitable result: less choice for parents. This would be much better faced now—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But surely the hon. Gentleman recognises that this just does not exist in nine-tenths of Scotland? He should address his remarks to rather a different argument, if his arguments are sound—to extending it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But that is a different argument. If I were the Minister, that means that the right hon. Gentleman would invite me to tell all local authorities to have fee-paying schools. I have never said that, and I would not say it, because that is not the way to run education, just as the Minister is not right to forbid ail local authorities to run fee-paying schools. This is another argument, but it is quite clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After this change, there will be less choice—some would say a little less, others a lot less—and if a parent has a child with an academic bent, his ability to get him into a school with a good staff and a good academic record will be determined by one thing only—where he lives in the city and whether he can afford to buy a house in one of the better areas. His child's schooling will depend entirely upon his purse—whether he can afford a better house. Where is the equality there or the fairness to the poorly-off parent? Although at present the poorly-off parent can get assistance to pay the fees, and indeed have them remitted altogether, in future no one will help him to buy a more expensive house——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why should they?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Land Commission may!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it might, no doubt, help him by raising the price——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0584">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>245</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does this happen in Ayrshire at present?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ayrshire does not come into the argument because it does not have any fee-paying schools. [	<i>Interruption</i>].</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are degenerating somewhat this morning. The hon. Member should be allowed to get on with his speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The last thing I wish to do is to degenerate——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said "we".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make clear, yet again, that I do not, and will not, suggest that every local authority should have fee-paying schools. All I say is that local authorities which wish should be free to do so. From this change onwards the choice may be small and it will be purely whether parents can afford to have a house in the right area. I was interested in the argument of the hon. Member for Midlothian (Mr. Eadie). He spoke interestingly and correctly about how schools in Fife had done so well and how the district is an attraction to manufacturers. There are two things which he forgot to say. One is that a large number of people in business go to the development area precisely because the Forth Road Bridge is now built and they can send their children to fee-paying schools if they wish to do so. He must know that many people do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alex Eadie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for giving way and I do not like interrupting him, but the point I was trying to make was that when industrialists go to an area where there is a comprehensive system of education they are happy because there is no selection and there is equality of opportunity for their children without all the nonsense about selection. This has nothing to do with accessibility of fee-paying schools. No one would come to the area so that he could send his child over the Forth Road Bridge to a fee-paying school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: People in fact do. The hon. Member can go there and find that this is so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eadie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very few.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>246</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps, but when people go into any county, not only Fife, one thing they make sure of is that they go to a part of the county in which there is a good school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then there is the argument that there is no choice because so many children applying for places are turned down. The answer to that should be that there should be more fee-paying schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Member asking for that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is up to the local authorities to do that. We ask that local authorities should be free to do so if they wish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument of the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East, taken to its conclusion, is that as so many are unable to get into these schools they should be abolished. That seems a very strange argument. He said that pretty clearly in his speech. I am glad that he is in no danger of running transport for Edinburgh Corporation. He might say that the No. 24 bus service should be withdrawn altogether because only so many people can travel on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then there was the argument put by the Minister implicitly, and almost explicity, that this is a moment when there are difficulties about spending on all kinds of priority and the spending of a quarter of a million pounds on abolishing fee-paying schools is a priority. He could go to almost any part of Scotland, certainly Ayrshire, and be told that a quarter of a million pounds would make a very great difference to many educational problems there. His argument is ludicrous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had the argument about why parents pay fees at all. Incidentally, the right hon. Member said that no one pays fees voluntarily and no one pays for education for the love of it. I know what he meant, but many people give donations for educational bursaries and that sort of thing. The whole system in places like Edinburgh is full of such things. We do not know, and cannot know, why one person spends more on one item than on another. Some people we think extravagant because they buy things which are expensive while other people buy cheaply. Some people pay fees for education while others who are
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0585">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>247</span>
well off raise a great cry at the suggestion that they should pay a penny extra for school meals. This is all a matter of different viewpoints and likes and dislikes, a matter of personal choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suppose that a parent pays fees if he has an academically inclined child so that the child can be educated with other academically inclined children. This has nothing to do with his background but with a desire to see the child educated with children of similar interests. That is not a bad thing from any point of view, certainly not a bad thing educationally. Educationally it could hardly be better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We come back to the question of assessment of ability and aptitude in pupils. We heard a lot of this in discussion of the last Amendment. We should recognise that this is not connected with social background, except incidentally. Nor is ability or aptitude connected with financial richness or poorness. There are wide differences between children. It is extremely bad to push a child too hard when he is not up to it and to force him to learn Latin and complicated mathematics when he is not up to that but it is equally bad from an educational point of view not to extend an academically brilliant child to the maximum of his ability. Here we come to the real nub of the argument. It is bad educational practice not to give the academically inclined child his head. One can only give him his head if he is put with similar children with whom he can compete. Only in this way will children get a chance of doing as well as they can with their abilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When talking of equality of opportunity it is most important to see that each child can develop its own talents. We do not do that by lumping all children together irrespective of ability and expecting them to develop their talents to the best of their ability.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member has said something which I should like him to make perfectly clear. Did I follow him correctly? Did he say that to bring out the best in children at school they should be made to compete with one another? Does he say that after careful thought? Does he realise that it is not a fact? Young people co-operate
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>248</span>
within the school and the class they do not compete with one another in the sense in which we use the term competition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not for the first time, I am sorry but I do not agree with the hon. Member. I believe, and I think many people believe, that the right way to give people equality of opportunity is to put those with similar abilities together and enable them to compete against one another. There are numerous occasions throughout education in which one finds that a potentially clever child has fallen behind because he has not had the stimulus of others competing with him. When arguing for and against coeducation, some say that one of the great advantages in bringing boys and girls together in schools is that the girls are sharper earlier at learning than boys and that had a good effect on the boys.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I give an example of what was in my mind? Does the hon. Member associate this competition with fee-paying? If so, has he heard of Hamilton Academy where there is no competition within the school itself? That is for the simple reason that the children are not all engaged on the same type of subject. Does he realise that in the bursary list of Glasgow examinations over the last few years that school has taken up a position which is not rivalled by any fee-paying school in Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because of shortness of time I will not follow the hon. Member all the way in that argument, but, if a parent lives in an area in Glasgow where the school is short of teachers the child is not likely to get a good chance of advancement to university standards. Under the new arrangements, whereby there would be no chance whatever of going to a fee-paying school, such a possibly academically brilliant child would never make the grade and get to university. That is a tragedy which will come as a direct result of the policy of abolishing completely fee paying in our big cities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In discussion of the last Amendment the Minister admitted that selectivity itself is not a sin and that selectivity must take place. He says that it will take place inside the comprehensive school. I do not quarrel particularly with that, but selectivity there is and always must be in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0586">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>249</span>
good education. That is why it is tragic at this time to be removing, at the cost of a quarter of a million pounds, the chance for the poorly-off parent with a brilliant child to get the child to a school where it can make the most of its talents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the charge against the Government. That is what this change will do in education in Scotland. The Minister should go at least this far. He should say, if he likes, that it is an eventual aim to remove fee-paying schools, but at present his priority will be to put all the money resources and the skill of his Department into building up the less favoured schools, which have not the staff they need and are in poor areas, to a stage at which they can come up to the standard of all the other schools. Then he would be doing a service to education, which he is not doing by destroying these famous, old and tried establishments which are doing a wonderful job for Scottish education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened with hope at first to the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) because I thought that at last we would get a better speech than those which have been made from the Opposition so far, but I have never heard quite such a fundamentally diehard speech from any Tory in all the years in which I have listened to education debates in Committee or the House. He did not answer the Minister's questions. The Minister made an excellent speech and demolished, brick by brick, the whole case constructed by hon. Members opposite.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman did not even knock a chimney down far less demolish the house.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.0 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister knocked down every brick of the case which was erected, if it was erected, or merely jerry-built, by hon. Members opposite. I hoped that the hon. Member for Ayr would put a little cement of sense around what was left of the edifice, but he leaned far too much on prejudice and far too little on his usual undoubted ability. He went through the same argument as the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor), and he debased the quality of what might have been a much better speech in suggesting that if the best
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>250</span>
schools cannot be kept wholly for the people who live in the best houses, then those people will move out of the town and take houses in the areas where there are the best schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is an extraordinary case on which to build an argument against a policy which is a priority national interest. Education is a national priority and not a mere matter of localities, fee-paying and personal prejudices and the snobbery of individual parents. It is much more than questions of complete autonomy in deciding the standards and nature of education by local authorities, which vary from one area to another. He said that there would be almost a property buying rush for the suburbs, based on the desire and right to pay fees, this—to him—tremendously fundamental business of paying school fees of £7 or so a term for the family, or for some of it, if it is not too big a family. If anybody believes the hon. Gentleman it might well damage the value of many city properties and there may be a rush to the suburbs befor the Bill goes through. The hon. Gentleman will be answerable to the property owners.

He did not answer the point about the undesirable social divisions even in families created by educational privilege. He did not answer the point that in a family of six, even if the parents could pay for one or two of the family it might not afford to pay fees for the other four or five children and those children might be excluded by selectivity and lack of free places. It is no argument to say that if a parent cannot afford to pay fees for his whole family he can get a form of subsidy for the other excluded three or four children. Free places cannot necessarily be obtained for them in the same school, and the family will be divided, just as the hon. Member is dividing society, on the most arbitrary, unjust and indefensible lines. As within the family so within society.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has slightly missed the point.

regard to fee-paying. This poor family will be divided in every possible direction, to such an extent that the whole future life within the family, and, later, outside in society, will be governed and haunted by this one arbitrary and final decision as to whether all or only some of the children enter the type of school which the hon. Gentleman wants them to enter or fail to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He did not tell us why, if fee-paying schools are of such high quality, there is no demand among local authorities or among the people of Scotland generally for more fee-paying schools. If there is something to sell that is so valuable then it should be in general demand. Where, then, is the tremendous demand for it? The local authorities and the parents are completely free to state their choice. The parents, after all, elect the local authorities. Clearly, therefore, there is no such demand, as the hon. Gentleman knows perfectly well. The hon. Gentleman is battling against the outgoing tide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If there is not such a demand, will the hon. Gentleman explain why the Labour-controlled Glasgow Corporation of the time decided to spend many thousands of pounds on building a new fee-paying school to replace one which was falling down?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I imagine that this is purely a matter of the physical replacement of buildings and of obsolescence. I do not care what it is called; it can, at present, be called a potential fee-paying school; but it will not be a fee-paying school when the Bill becomes law, so it does not matter very much, and the point is not important in itself. Anyway, I am not answerable for Glasgow Corporation; the hon. Gentleman can answer for them. He has much more in common with them at this moment than I have.

The hon. Gentleman fell right back again upon the discredited academic élite, the old academic rat race, but conducted in the correct way and exclusively among the best rats, if he wants to use that phrase. The hon. Gentleman did not visualise or bother to mention the possibility and desirability of social and environmental action to assist the average and the sub-average. He was concerned only with what he called the best, most
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>252</span>
naturally gifted, the luckiest and most favoured. He wanted to give them further special favour. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, North (Earl of Dalkeith) said that they were biologically more fortunate. I think that was the phrase which he used in a quotation in the Second Reading debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Clark Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Edinburgh, South said that, in quoting the American President Calvin Coolidge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It shows how carefully I follow his speeches, when I note even his quotations. He leaned on this biological natural selection on the academic side, in that speech, and I thought it was a pretty fundamentalist argument for gentleman who can cheerfully and uncritically accept the monarchy, the hereditary aristocracy and the rest with any biological justification whatever. We have had the whole traditional Tory hog in slices or in chunks, and have ended up with what amounted to the primitive acceptance of the survival of the fittest, which, as Chesterton once said, was no more than the survival of the survivors. Except for one careful provision that certain people among the survivors opposite want to be sure they survive, and they will take out an insurance policy in the form of special educational advantage by fees and special selection. That again creates privilege and social segregation in later life; and is in many respects from our point of view, apart from comprehensive education, quite inconsistent with and unreasonable in a democratic society.

The hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) spoke in terms of local democracy, local authorities and local freedom of choice. He has never realised yet that this is a national question. The standard of education is not a matter which can be left to the prejudice, snobberies and the very often uninformed choice of individual parents and even local authorities. Fortunately, the local authorities as a whole are not asking for what he is asking for, and his case therefore does not stand very strongly on local democracy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Glasgow and Edinburgh are asking very strongly, for what we are asking in this debate.

Why does the hon. Gentleman constantly ignore this?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman can argue this for a long time, but local authorities in Scotland with just those two exceptions are not asking for it. Does he agree with that? He is arguing in favour of the last two exceptions; it is a rearguard action. If he goes through the whole of the other Scottish local authorities, including his own, he will find no support for his argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Along with personal freedom, education, which partly helps to guarantee personal freedom, is one of our greatest national priorities in every sense, not just educationally but socially and economically. It is far too important to be left as the pawn of local prejudices and class bias and purely individual judgments, and all the other things which have been mentioned so often on the other side of the Committee. It is a service which is essential to our national survival. It is not only a question of what a local authority decides, or of what a parent feels to be the best for a particular child because he wants to catch up with and exclude the Joneses, or wants to do the Browns one in the eye; it can no longer be left to these petty considerations. It is far too important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The trouble is that with the relatively affluent society this sort of snobbery is not decreasing but growing. It may be argued that the demand for fee-paying privileges will grow with affluence, but this simply should not be allowed. Our society is not becoming more affluent because of fee-paying schools. It happens that, as society became more affluent fee-paying schools were passing out, and the two things were going in opposite directions. The sad thing is that those who argue the Tory 	<i>status quo</i> also argue for the old status symbols, and certain people will listen to them. In a society where more people are able to buy things, once they have bought their cars, refrigerators, television and radios, they turn to the other status symbols of those who have enjoyed privileges beyond their own previous financial capacity, and they think among other ambitions, "Perhaps I should try to get a better school for the kids."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not a bad thing in itself in a purely parental sense; but we should not be thinking at this time of day of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>254</span>
good schools and bad schools. We should be improving all schools. That can be done only by the acceptance of the comprehensive policy, comprehensive in every sense of that term, comprehensive physical building, the environmental side of building, of education and so on, for the benefit of the average and under average children, which Newsom called "one half of the nation". These are the children about whom we should be thinking, not the tiny especially favoured percentage who should be given, according to hon. Members opposite, further special privilege in a society which in the mass does not want to continue the system of privilege, and certainly should not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find highly objectionable the story of the schoolmaster teaching in a council school, being paid by a local authority, himself the product of an ordinary non-fee paying school, who deems it necessary for some reason, presumably superior education to what he provides, to send his child from the far end of the Highlands of Scotland to a State subsidised privileged school. There is surely something wrong with his educational and social attitude of buying special education, buying a flying start for his child, out of all his own schoolchildren, whose parents entrust their children to him and his school. That is snobbery, and the hon. Gentleman knows that it is snobbery. How can he defend a man who is being paid by a local authority in a Scottish county, in an area where there are no fee-paying schools and no State-aided schools, sending his own children off to a State-aided special school so that it can be said of him in later life that he has had the best education in a privileged institution. Can he defend that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

That is the right of the parent, and it has nothing to do with his employment and nothing to do with his means. It is the right of a parent to choose, if he wishes, a different form of education for his child. The hon. Gentleman is saying that the State knows better than the parent what is best for his child, and I do not accept that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Gentleman was saying that this gentleman, who taught at a school in which he was glad to take employment from the parents of other children, thought that that school was not good enough for his own child, whom he proceeded to send to a State subsidised special caste school, at the expense of the excluded rest of his community. That is subsidised snobbery, whatever the hon. Gentleman says about it.

I was a pupil in a fee-paying school in Glasgow, through no choice of mine; it happened to be the nearest school. There was no selectivity, but we paid a little fee, £3 a term or something like that. Since that fee has been abolished the school, far from deteriorating, has improved. In those days there was an unqualified non-graduate headmaster, who compensated us by wearing a tall hat and tails, probably because it was a fee-paying school. Inside that school parents squabbled with the headmaster and with teachers because certain of their children were sent to a different building belonging to the same school, but a few hundred yards away. There was even then and there this consciousness of segragation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is no longer a question merely of keeping up with the Joneses, because most of the Joneses' children throughout Scotland are in the comprehensive schools anyway. As I have said, it is a question of putting one across the Joneses and at the same time giving the Browns one in the eye, in two remaining localities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the hon. Gentleman and his friends have in mind is pampering the already naturally and financially fortunate, which is the least necessary function of teachers and of education. Those who are naturally able are best able to help themselves without the special privileges which the hon. Gentleman are hoping to be able to buy for them through what they would regard as better teachers who are attracted to such favoured schools, and through smaller classes which they hope will be realised in them.

Robbins pointed out that there is a large pool of ability in the community among teenagers who are working for and, often, hungry and, always, being denied higher education. He said that it was vital to us as a nation that this pool should be utilised, and that the best possible results must be obtained by sustained social action. Newson has said the same in discussing the 13 to 16 year olds. He advocated that the merely average, but especially the less than average, should be kept longer at school so that they would be less open to exploitation, through their having less ability than the best academically. There is much to be said in favour of that point of view. Other countries have recognised it and are far ahead of us—the French, Americans, Swedes and Germans, and many more. It is high time that we paid more attention to the average and the slightly less than average, so that we may draw from that unutilised pool of undeveloped capacity what the nation is now losing. This is no matter just for individual parents or, even, local authorities, but for the nation. It is important that education, from the building to the wider social environment, should be seen and developed in that context, so that the fullest opportunities can be given to this great mass of undeveloped ability and under-privileged capacity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that comprehensive education is essential to this purpose. It gives continuity of opportunity right through the school life. It gives continuity of assessment instead of arbitrary tests which have a finality to which even university entrants and university graduates are not subjected. They at least have another chance, possibly too many chances in some cases, with the great pressure there is for as many abler entrants as possible to get into universities. We must raise the school leaving age even beyond 16, and we must abolish differentials in treatment, and also all forms of segregation, including state grant-aided schooling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cath-cart spoke of the equality of opportunity at this selective point, as if that were the end of the matter. In common with a number of his hon. Friends, his view is that, with selectivity, the best will get it, and it is too bad about those who fail. That was the general line of the arguments of hon. Gentlemen opposite.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

I cannot begin to understand that. They must be aware that there are late developers, who may be by far the majority of children. Who knows the standards that they would attain if they were given an opportunity to reveal their capacities through a proper system of continuous assessment, with action taken to ensure that their abilities are properly revealed and developed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What hon. Gentlemen opposite have to offer is a system which by definition, is exclusive. At least this can be said for comprehensive education—that it is comprehensive and, therefore, not exclusive. If the mass of children are excluded by means of selection of the few, we are doing something which is dangerous to the majority of our society and to everyone concerned.

Unless we have regard to the environmental factors, we shall never see the best in our community of young people being given an opportunity of self realisation and self expression, of attainment and of making their contributions to the society in which we live. The whole attitude which emerged from the speech of the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger)—though I know that he holds his views honestly, and I do not challenge his sincerity—to my mind was fundamentally offensive to so many people who have never had a chance to show their own talents and develop their own abilities and who are all for giving these opportunities to their children. I find his whole argument fundamentally wrong—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Wright) apparently finds this amusing. If he does, I do not mind.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if I disappointed the hon. Gentleman. I was searching for one little quotation, and it is part of an address given to the E.I.S. in Glasgow some time ago by a gentleman who has distinguished himself in many fields. Professor Murdo Ewen Macdonald, Professor of Practical Theology in Trinity College, Glasgow. He is listened to with respetc on many social questions. I thought that his comment is possibly as good as any that I have seen in this connection. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The fee-paying schools are commonly defended on the ground that, despite their exclusiveness, they still provide the best education in the country. That pagans could think like this is understandable for, after all, they had their own pre-suppositions. But that Christians should brazenly use such an argument is surely the blasphemy of blasphemies. If this system is the best, bestowing its benedictions on the few and excluding the many, it imposes an intolerable burden on the Christian conscience. Christians in this regard are not pulling together. They are not members of a team. They are not even in the same boat."</p></blockquote>
The contributions of hon. Gentlemen opposite to the debate have, in my view, driven members and classes of our nation further and further apart. We can only thank heaven that Scotland as a whole has come to its senses, apart from the academically troglodyte exceptions opposite.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I trust that the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before addressing to the Minister some five question which remain for me fundamental and which, despite his long speech the other day, he did not answer, I want to make two or three preliminary points. I preface my questions by saying that it seems to me that the Title of the Bill is wrong. It should not be the Education (Scotland) Bill but the Social Snobbery (Scotland) Bill. The burden of the speeches of right hon. and hon. Gentlemen opposite has been to seek, apparently by legislation, to get rid of social snobbery, especially in the good City of Edinburgh.

In his speech the other day, the Minister did not face up to the problem which is before the Committee on this Amendment. We are not discussing comprehensive education or selectivity. Despite what the hon. Member for the Western Isles said, we are not discussing the need for social action to assist the average or sub-average. We are not even concerned with environmental factors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there were a key example of the difference between the two major parties—or between two parties, since the Liberal voice was identical to the Socialist voice—it would be indicated by this six-hour debate. We are discussing whether the existing handful of fee-paying schools should remain in being. That is the issue before us, and it is an educational as well as a social question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was surprised to hear the Minister say that each individual has particular aptitudes and abilities in particular directions, and that there is no such thing as general ability in the absolute sense. I accept fully that it is the task of education to discover any individual's aptitudes and develop them to the full, but, with respect, I doubt whether it is true that there is no such thing as general ability in the absolute sense. One important feature of British education—and, nowadays, of American education—is that it believes in the ability to transfer methods of learning from one subject, one discipline, and one type of background, to another. If we are concerned, as we all are, about the average and the less average child, then, on the very doctrine of equality. we owe to the above average child an equal opportunity for the exploitation of his talents and, on an educational basis, those talents must be stretched. To use the words of Lord Reith in another context:
	<br><blockquote><p>"You will only get the best out of the above average chap if you push him hard."</p></blockquote>
That is what higher education is about, and it is no use bringing in this social motivation which is not relevant to the Amendment——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman say that the above average pupil would not be pushed sufficiently in the top streams of a comprehensive school?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>260</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would have to be a very special comprehensive school, built to very special patterns. Here are existing schools doing a very good job, and, as yet, no case for obliterating them has been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point about the debate so far is that, right through some of the speeches to which we have listened, there has been a doctrine emerging. The controversy essentially is between a doctrine which, to some, may be a most admirable one, and the reality of the situation in Glasgow and Edinburgh. This is the permanent contrast between Socialism and Conservatism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Mr. Maclennan) said that it is the job of any Government to be concerned with this issue. The Minister said that it is wrong that a small number of parents should be allowed to pay fees. Earlier this morning, there was a reference to the iniquity of someone living in the north of Scotland who chooses to send his son to Dollar. The right hon. Member for Lanarkshire, North (Miss Herbison) said that it is undesirable if there should be any long delay, and then that curious Liberal, the hon. Member for Ross and Cromarty (Mr. Alasdair Mackenzie), emphasised that it is the job of the Government to govern in education. Finally, the hon. Member for the Western Isles said that education is a national matter and that this is a national question——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A "national priority" was my main emphasis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is no use saying any longer that education is a matter for local government. The very premises of this argument are taking education out of a local context and making it a national question. If we accept that, we know where we stand about the future of local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the third preliminary point to my five questions, I want to take up the reference made by the hon. Member for the Western Isles to the parallels in Russia and the United States——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman repeatedly distorts what I said. He even distorts the geography of the argument. I did not once mention Russia. It may

be that I should have done, because that country is far ahead of us in some respects.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for the Western Isles mentioned America, and reference was made earlier to Sweden and Russia. Indeed, Russia was referred to in a most curious speech by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Scotstoun (Mr. Small). It was a delightful speech, indicating a great deal of knowledge of the middle-class origins of Lenin and his wife. It would not be relevant if I followed the logic of that argument about Communism emerging from a middle-class intelligentsia in the 1870s in Leningrad. I wish that the hon. Gentleman was on as safe ground when speaking about the problems of Scotstoun as of Russia.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman speaks about education being a national question. Does he agree that it was a good or bad state when the educational function passed from the sphere of the old local school board to the wider sphere of the county and the big city?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not quite sure what the hon. Gentleman means by "function". We are in danger of using a number of words without very precise definition. I accept that there is a preoccupation with the broad principles of national education. If that is what the other side are saying, I think that I understand what they are talking about, but I still do not accept its logic. We have always believed that principles are translated, where education is concerned, into reality through local action by local education authorities and board schools, since the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) referred to them, some of which are still so visibly described in his constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eadie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has shown great gaps in his knowledge of local government administration.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has always been assumed that a local authority has the right to say what is the most appropriate form of education for the children of the parents living in that locality. This is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>262</span>
what we are discussing. This is the whole core of the debate. I will come back to this point. I do not want to lose the point that I was making earlier, which was still a preliminary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman was in Russia.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was either in the United States or in Sweden. I simply wish to drive home to the hon. Member for the Western Isles that one of the interesting features of contemporary education in the United States—I cannot speak about Sweden or Russia—is their admiration of the British grammar school and university system, their concern with what they call alpha people, and their wish to have special schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman address himself to the American educational system as it is now, under which there are at least 30 per cent. more pupils at school to the age of 16 and about 60 per cent. of their total school population until 18. They are miles ahead of us under a similar system to our own, far less from fee paying or any other special education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are not debating American education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we were, we could talk about it at great length. They have a state system in which everyone is entitled to attend a state school or university through to the age of 22. What I am saying is that a feature over the last few years—and Professor Koerner's book is an indication of this—is a growing admiration for the features of British education which this Government are busy attacking.

I do not think that the Committee has yet fully faced up to the cost involved in these proposals. In the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum the figures for loss of income in a full year are £225,000, plus £25,000 for books and materials. The Minister will be aware
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0593">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>263</span>
that Glasgow Education Committee does not accept these figures. It has been pointed out repeatedly that it decided to increase fees in any event last August. The figure of £25,000 for books and materials would not even permit replacement of existing books and materials, much less permit the introduction of new books into the schools. Apart from that, there are two glaring omissions from these financial calculations. One is that it would cost about £1¼ million to about £1½ million to alter these schools or to build new comprehensive schools whereby to replace them. That point was made in an earlier meeting of the Committee by my hon. Friend the Member for Galloway (Mr. Brewis). But no reference has been made to the fact that the large comprehensive schools will need athletic facilities and playing fields, because the playing fields are owned by the F.P. clubs—for instance, Glasgow High School at Anniesland and Hillhead at Hughenden. Has the Minister considered the cost of attempting to buy these playing fields? Has he considered, in his siting of where these new schools would have to be, the cost involved? I do not believe that the figures which the Minister is giving us are accurate. I believe that the cost will be greatly in excess of the figures in the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second question comes under the heading "freedom". What about parental freedom of choice? This point has already been made repeatedly and I do not want to press it. What I want to bring to the attention of the Committee is the impact on Catholic education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference has already been made to this, but I should like to refer the Minister—I am sure that he has seen the document to the deliberations which went on in Glasgow City Chambers on 14th February, 1968, which is a reminder of how long there has been pressure on Glasgow and Edinburgh to take the action which is now being made necessary by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Headmistress of Notre Dame High School said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is, it must be remembered, a legal contract drawn up in 1940 between the Corporation and my Religious Order which is binding on both parties. Notre Dame has every intention of honouring its side of the contract.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>264</span>
… This contract carries the Education Committee's guarantee that the school will remain single-sex, non-territorial, selective and fee-paying."</p></blockquote>
I should like clarification from the Minister. Has he considered the implications of this and has he considered the views of the Catholic Hierarchy on this whole question? He will not need me to remind him that they have emphasised the importance of parental choice, and a number of Glasgow Corporation councillors have long emphasised the same point. The Headmistress continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The abolition of the Corporation fee-paying and selective entry schools on the grounds of social inequality would create another inequality in so far as it would leave five grant-aided Protestant girls' schools with selective entry but no such Catholic school in the Glasgow area."</p></blockquote>
I submit that the Minister is on very dangerous ground here. He will recall that about a third of the children in Glasgow are Catholics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To emphasise the point admirably made by my hon. Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) in his opening speech about the wide variety of backgrounds from which the children come, the Headmistress of Notre Dame says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Meanwhile, the wide social range represented by the school's present roll—and which is supposed to be one of the aims of comprehensive education—will be destroyed. At the present the school draws its pupils from, among other areas, Maryhill. Priesthill, Govan, Kings-park, Cranhill, Partick, Whiteinch, Drumchapel, Carntyne, Knightswood. Bishopbriggs, Baillieston, Carnwadrie "—</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Extracts are all very well, and I allow them in moderation, but they must not be too long. That reads and sounds like a railway timetable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Jennings. I have in fact made the point, except for one other sentence which I believe is relevant to what we are discussing:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Since the, Notre Dame Order was founded to teach all classes of children, but especially the poor, which nowadays means the working class, it would be a great personal sorrow to me and my Order if this cherished portion of our flock were withdrawn from the present High School. It would, too, be something of a paradox that this should be done by order of a Labour Government."</p></blockquote>
I think that I have made the point that there is real concern here that when we say "freedom" we are not merely
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0594">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>265</span>
discussing parental freedom: we are in some measure discussing religious freedom and certainly local freedom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a very dangerous argument indeed to which the hon. Gentleman is giving voice. Nothing in the letter which he has read to the Committee suggests that Notre Dame fears for the religious education of its pupils. Nothing in that letter suggests that the pupils currently attending Notre Dame High School will not be able to continue to be educated at Roman Catholic schools in Glasgow. Will the hon. Gentleman make that point clear?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pointing out the disparity that would obtain, if this legislation goes through, between the opportunity for Catholic children to get the education that they at present get at Notre Dame—which I think is guaranteed in law to the year 2,000, although I should need to check that fact—and the ample opportunity will remain, even after the Bill goes through, for Protestant children to get an education in the direct grant schools in Glasgow and Edinburgh.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could we have this point clear for clarity's sake? Is the hon. Gentleman insinuating or is he not, because he did not answer my hon. Friend's question, that there is a withdrawal of religious freedom? This is the second time in this Committee that we have had this insinuation. The first time it came from the hon. Member for Galloway (Mr. Brewis). We must be clear about this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These are not insinuations. I am quoting—and the Chairman rebuked me for doing so—the actual evidence before the Glasgow Education Committee. There is no question of insinuations. I am stating facts. I am quoting from the headmistress of the school concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to emphasise one other aspect of freedom which disturbs me just as much. We are here legislating at the expense of Glasgow and Edinburgh. I believe that this is the central core of the discussion. If the Bill goes through and becomes an Act, which is likely, and if there are the changes which would logically follow concerning the Glasgow and Edinburgh High schools and fee-paying schools, the whole character of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>266</span>
Scottish education is thereby transformed. Under the heading of "freedom", I ask the Minister: who is asking for these changes to be made? Did the Glasgow Corporation, during its 33 years of Labour control, ask for this legislation? When this proposal was put to Tom Johnston 25 to 30 years ago did he not positively say that this would be an unwise step to take? Has Edinburgh asked for these changes to be made? Have the parents of the children at these schools asked for these changes? Indeed, has there been any evidence put before us of the failure of these schools on educational grounds? Not a single voice, of course, can be raised to suggest that this is so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Alice Cullen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman would tell us whether the letter from Notre Dame came personally to him from the Headmistress of that school?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I got hold of this letter after a long discussion with a number of people. Notre Dame is fully aware that I have it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When an hon. Member, speaking from the Front Bench opposite, quotes letters like that, of a very controversial nature, is it not proper to explain to the Committee precisely what the document is? I was under the impression, as I think was my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Gorbals (Mrs. Cullen), that this was a personal letter from the Headmistress of Notre Dame, to the hon. Gentleman. [HON. MEMBERS: "No."] I think that there ought to be clarity about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I said—and I hope that the record will prove that I did—that this begins,
	<br><blockquote><p>"Meeting in City Chambers on Wednesday. 14th February, 1968, between representatives of the Catholic fee-paying and selective schools and the special sub-Committee."</p></blockquote>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the Minister's evidence of a need for change? Since he cannot tell us that Glasgow Corporation, Edinburgh, or any of the parents concerned, wants change, this must be

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>267</span>
Socialist dogmatism imposed on Glasgow and Edinburgh. I deplore this as much as any other aspect of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the six hours and more of our debate we have discussed a social view of education. As an ex-educator, one must be concerned about one's subject and not just its social context, and I am concerned that about 1,750 parents with children at Glasgow High School have signed a petition against the Bill. This seems evidence of the steamrollering to which my hon. Friend referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of these schools are very old. It was on their model that Glasgow Education Authority built up the present non fee-paying schools. The Hutcheson's Trust Schools and Glasgow High School were taken as the models. When there have been so many references, even by the Under-Secretary, to an "élite", as though it were a smear, I would reply that the whole character of Scotland has been built up by its academies and high schools. This is the source of Scotland's democracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee owes these brighter boys and girls the same opportunity—through the token fee which is paid, at any rate in Glasgow—as is offered to others, by the very nature of democracy. In any intelligent democracy—I include the American and the Russian—they are concerned with élites by education, by merit. This is what democracy is all about. That is why I am concerned by the evidence of Socialist dogmatism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were discussing what sort of school building would replace the schools in Glasgow which are under attack. Is it true that Allen Glen's would become a territorial comprehensive school, but combined with a city public alongside it but not part of it? Is it true that the High School for Girls and Hillhead High School would be linked as two single-sex schools in a territorial comprehensive unit, although they are a long distance apart? What are the plans for the other fee-paying schools? Is there not a danger, at any rate in these two examples, of destroying the good for the sake of some dream of social equality, which in itself may be impeccable but which is doing a grave disservice to some splendid schools which are the very basis of the Scottish school system?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>268</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must curtail my remarks because of the time. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Wright), particularly in his remarks about the Notre Dame School, did the Committee a grave disservice. I wish to challenge specifically one impression which he, not very cleverly, tried to convey. Is he suggesting that, in any new form of comprehensive education, the religious liberty enjoyed by Notre Dame or any other school is in danger, or will he admit that the only thing involved is the assimilation of these schools into a comprehensive system?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am simply voicing what I believe is the concern—I put it no higher than that—of the Catholic Hierarchy about the impact of this legislation on specific Catholic schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But that does not answer the question. Have the Catholic Hierarchy or the governors of Notre Dame told the hon. Member that they are worried about the continuation of or interference with their religious education?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh, no. I have never said that. That is not in question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to have that cleared up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also have documents from the Corporation. Going back to Tom Johnston's day—I was not in the House then but I remember it clearly—the only issue was the legal contract. Tom Johnston sent it back to the local authority solely on the grounds that, if the authority could resolve the legal problem, he would then proceed. Tom Johnston was a shrewd politician and leader and he played the ball back into the local authority's court, which is where it has rested ever since.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is where it should stay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The only question was that of the legal contract which the local authority had to observe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Wolrige-Gordon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not represent Glasgow, so, for my own information, might I be told what is now the position of that contract between the local authority and the school?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0596">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>269</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must leave that to be answered by my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollok said that selectivity, environment and snobbery were not the issues here and that the only issue was the abolition of this handful of schools. I accepted most of that. There is a divergence of view among hon. Members opposite, contrary to the claim of the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) that they were all making clear statements. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) saw the light. The question of fees is as dead as the dodo. The hon. Member for Pollok says that it is not even a question of selectivity. That surprises me, because I had assumed, as I said on Second Reading, that that was their argument. But we seem to be coming closer and closer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The area of dispute seems to be only Glasgow and Edinburgh. No other local authority has asked for more fee-paying schools not even in Ayrshire. If they think that there are advantages in the paying of fees, where have hon. Gentlemen opposite been? They are all Tory local authorities in Scotland now—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not seen the papers this morning, but if all local authorities in Scotland are Tory, this is wonderful news and represents the Government's failure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those authorities immediately involved in this question are now Tory-controlled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been no pressure for more fee-paying places. The hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) said that he hoped that there would be some free places. If he is urging more free places in this limited area, the argument is tautological. It is limited to Glasgow and Edinburgh, in those cities to the secondary schools, and in those schools to about 5,000 places in each city. Is this the argument over which the Committee has had to spend all this time?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real answer lies in a speech by the hon. Member for Ayr outside the Committee, to the Scottish Conservative Association last week, reported in 	<i>The Glasgow Herald.</i> Apparently, he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Scottish M.Ps. are going into battle over this issue of fee-paying schools, which will
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>270</span>
show the back-seat drivers who criticise their Scottish M.Ps. just what we are doing."</p></blockquote>
This was designed, I think, to boost their flagging energy and enthusiasm for their party. The hon. Member gave them a rallying cry, but it was for a false battle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Galloway (Mr. Brewis) has associations with the E.I.S. which, in its Journal of 8th November, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is odd, to say the least of it. if not downright shameful, to find a heated public argument going on in Scotland about a modest step towards equality of opportunity in education which was achieved in England and Wales, apparently without any fuss, 34 years ago."</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire and others have recently said that, if they are returned at the next Election—which heaven forfend—they will reinstitute fee-paying—[HON. MEMBERS: "No."]—because the Bill will be repealed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is most important that this should be clearly understood. My hon. Friend said nothing of the kind. He said that we would restore this freedom to local authorities who wished to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, it is an empty promise, because all the local authorities have already said that they are willing and anxious to enter the comprehensive system. That is incompatible with the continuation of the fee-paying system, and that is what the Bill is all about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important that this undertaking should be clearly understood. The hon. Member says that it is an empty undertaking of no significance, but he is quite wrong. It is of very real significance to Edinburgh and Glasgow, the two local authorities which wish to retain these schools. If the Government make an order under the Clause, we shall rescind it, if it is the wish of the local authorities to continue these schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Member has the agreement of the Leader of the Opposition and of the right hon. Gentleman who was Minister of Education in England and Wales for that, because Conservative Ministers did this in England and Wales.

This subject apparently engenders such passion that reason is put to flight in the world of learning. The hon. Member for Galloway referred to Dr. Highet, the lecturer, and finished his speech by referring to an article in 	<i>The Glasgow Herald.</i> The hon. Member should read the 	<i>Scottish Educational Journal</i> more often than 	<i>The Glasgow Herald.</i> He would then be on safer ground. The 	<i>Scottish Educational Journal</i> said that Dr. Highet,
	<br><blockquote><p>"a lecturer in applied sociology at Glasgow University, succeeded in proving to his own complete satisfaction, in an article in 	<i>The Glasgow Herald</i> … that comprehensive schools could co-exist alongside selective fee-paying education authority schools. … So much for those who believe that one of the university scholar's first loyalties is to the principles of logic."</p></blockquote>
The E.I.S., at its conference in 1964, asked by resolution that fee-paying schools should go.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had many arguments and allegations of dogma, hypocrisy, malice, spite and envy, but when there is not a case hon. Members opposite allege all these things. Even the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights has been brought in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point has not been taken by some hon. Members opposite on selectivity. Of course there must be selectivity, but hon. Members opposite want a creaming off and depriving of the comprehensive schools of all that intelligence and energy. We believe in the comprehensive system in which, it is admitted, there are good comprehensive schools to which parents send their children if they cannot get them into fee-paying schools. The teachers receive the same training and salary. What is the justification of the argument in view of the limited area we are debating? Why this anxiety to retain something which cannot meet the new projected system of education?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that hon. Members opposite keep saying that the nub of the argument has not been answered. My hon. Friend made one of the best comprehensive answers to the Opposition on this question. He slaughtered them absolutely. The purpose of this change—this is the nub of the matter—is to end fee paying in local authority schools because the charging of such fees within a public
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>272</span>
system of education is in conflict with the principle of equality of opportunity for all children. The inclusion within an authority school provision of fee-paying schools which are not necessarily selective is impossible to reconcile with the Government's policy of comprehensive education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the later part of his speech the hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollok put this point to my hon. Friend. A Government are entitled to promote, as a result of election promises, whether in education, social insurance or anything else, policies which, in their view, are calculated not only to provide better opportunities for boys and girls but to ensure that latent material within the large group will be put to the best use not only for the individual's benefit but for the nation's benefit. We believe that the comprehensive system of education, with selectivity and the possibility of change from one course to another in the comprehensive school, is more likely to do that than a continuation of the creaming off of the more able. Those who have that propensity and ability, with the backing of their parents, will in any case make their way. It is the 80 per cent. or 85 per cent. of boys and girls who until now have had that possibility limited who are the diamonds in the raw material for whom we should provide facilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been said that some comprehensive schools are not of the same high quality as others. I understand the point which is worrying some hon. Members opposite. They are afraid that on a territorial basis little rough characters may come in. That is another argument. It is an argument about social conduct and indiscipline which applies not only to young people in this country but throughout the world. I offer for consideration by hon. Members opposite something said by the headmaster of one of the best comprehensive schools in the City of Glasgow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been making comparisons between schools and the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart referred to a fee-paying school which was being rebuilt. That was because it was a slum. Many comprehensive schools have far better buildings, are better equipped and have as good, or better teachers than some fee-paying schools. Hon. Members opposite are nodding their heads in agreement, so
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0598">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>273</span>
why is there all this furore about the abolition of fee-paying schools? Some fee-paying schools could not stand comparison with some comprehensive schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Brewis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman suggest that those schools should be pulled down?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suggest that in due course buildings, whether they are of fee-paying schools or public service schools, which have deteriorated in layout or building construction, should be. This is going on all the time, whether they are fee-paying schools or local authority schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The headmaster of one of the best secondary schools in Glasgow, in Knights-wood, said that it was "just not true" to suggest that a gifted child would be adversely affected by contact with those who are less gifted. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollok knows that it is more pleasant to teach children who are all of about the same intellectual ability, but it calls for more teaching skill in a comprehensive school to encourage a boy or girl who has a little blank spot. If he can overcome that disability he can go on to greater things.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The headmaster said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Standards were, in fact, raised in work, dress, manners and behaviour. Comprehensive schools might even help ultimately to narrow the gap between 'management' and 'men' where people shouted incomprehensibly to one another across fixed lines and attitudes."</p></blockquote>
The headmaster was suggesting that if hon. Members opposite had been to some of these schools they would not be shouting incomprehensibly and might have a better understanding of the problems and difficulties in the educational system. The same school was used by the S.E.D. and the Scottish Films Council to make a film to be shown all over the world describing the advantages which Glasgow and our educational system have to offer. It is not a fee-paying school it is a normal local authority school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I sometimes wonder why hon. Members opposite make the points they make. They force some of us to the conclusion, however reluctantly, that they are still on the side of—I do not want to engender heat so I shall try to find another word for "privilege"—advantage for the élite. That word was not used by us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>274</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. My hon. Friend was referring to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith) who first used the word in the Second Reading debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire said that those children who did not succeed could go elsewhere. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"They receive excellent education somewhere else, perhaps in an independent or grant-aided school or, more likely, in one of the Scottish public schools for which my admiration is no less than the Minister's."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>First Scottish Standing Committee;</i> 6th Feb., 1969; c. 142.]</p></blockquote>
In that remark he made the point not for the retention of fee-paying schools which is now largely admitted by hon. Members opposite to be no longer the argument. The argument is whether the fee-paying schools should remain in the public service and whether for a small payment of fees people should have what they think is a better form of education and an advantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member spoke about salaries. That was no surprise. Dockers receive £20 a week and miners £25 a week—Hon. Members opposite are back in the Stone Age and we are having to drag them by the hair of their heads into the twentieth century. They are as bad in Opposition as they were in Government. They do not see how far and how fast the world has moved forward. They do not see that egalitarianism, at which they sneer, is a matter of educational opportunities. It is not a question of levelling everyone down, but of equality of opportunity.

Hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have not got very far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We have managed to get four speakers in this morning and we have three-quarters of an hour left before we adjourn. It is difficult to interpret the mind of the Committee, but I might chance it and say that it could be the desire of the Committee to dispose of this Amendment this morning. I therefore now propose to call the Minister, Mr. Bruce Millan, and Mr. Ian MacArthur to sum up at the end.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Bruce Millan)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Jennings, I am not quite sure what you mean by that. I certainly intend to speak at the minute since we have already had a Front Bench speech from the other side of the Committee this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. If an hon. Member who opened a debate wishes to wind up it is customary to call him. This happens on both sides of the Committee. I am giving the Minister another opportunity to intervene. It is quite fair. If he wishes to speak last I will reverse the order; I am quite prepared to do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I made rather a long speech at the last Sitting, so perhaps I need not spend a great deal of time in answering the points which have been raised this morning, particularly as no new points were raised from the other side.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not mind the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) ignoring the arguments which I made at the last meeting of the Committee, but I minded rather more his ignoring all the facts about the existing situation which I produced at our last Sitting. For example, I might as
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>276</span>
well never have given figures about the number of free places for all the notice he took of them. He spoke about the free places in fee-paying schools in terms absolutely inconsistent with the facts. He said, for example, that any poor parents, as he described them, who wished their children to go to fee-paying schools, could be covered by free places, but they certainly cannot be covered in Glasgow High School by free places because there are no free places in Glasgow High School. Out of the five fee-paying schools in Glasgow there is only one, namedy Allen Glen's, which is a boys' and not a girls' school, which has free places. How the poor parents of a girl in Glasgow manage to be covered by the existing system when there are no girls' schools with free places I am not able to imagine. I do not want to belabour the point. I just want to repeat that the hon. Gentleman paid no attention to the facts and arguments I gave at the last meeting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the end of the day—and my hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) pointed this out admirably—his speech amounted to an unmitigated plea for the selective system and for privilege in education. He continually spoke of good schools and the necessity to preserve good schools in terms, as my hon. Friend pointed out, that suggested that he divides the State schools into good, desirable schools on the one hand and bad, undesirable schools on the other. I am very far from saying that every school in the State sector is equally good as compared with every other school. That would be an absurdity. We know that that is not the situation, either at primary or secondary level, but I count it to be absolutely essential for any Government or any local education authority to organise education in a way which does not enable us to divide schools into a comparatively small number of good schools, on the one hand, and a large number of less good or bad schools on the other. An educational policy based on that system helps to perpetuate the system rather than to eliminate it. Educational policy cannot be decided on the basis that there are and there always will be a small number of good schools and a large number of schools which are less good.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>277</span>
In addition to being a bad argument on the merits of the situation, that argument does not meet the facts of the situation in Scotland. One only has to point to other education authorities outside Glasgow and Edinburgh to see that the implications of the hon. Gentleman's speech do not meet the Scottish situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman speaks about the facts. Is he maintaining that a child who happens to live in an area where there is a grossly understaffed school, where possibly there is even part-time education, has an absolutely equal opportunity of getting to university with a child who lives in another part of the town which has a well-staffed school?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I dealt with this explicitly in my speech at the last Sitting. The able child of a family which is concerned with education does not suffer under the present arrangement regardless of the school that that child attends. That is a statement of fact, at the present time, even——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Even with half-time education?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: —even in areas where there is teacher shortage. But teacher shortage and seeing that the teachers we have are more evenly distributed throughout the educational system is a much wider question. This is a serious problem but it is much wider than the question of whether we should have fee-paying at a small number of schools. It is a problem which affects the situation in the industrial waist of Scotland, on the one hand, and the situation in Aberdeen or in Fife where there is a favourable teacher supply position on the other. The retention of the small number of fee-paying schools which we have now will make no difference to that situation, which calls for a more fundamental approach which I hope on another occasion we may be able to deal with in Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brewis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman now answer my hon. Friend's question about whether a child who goes to a school where there is part-time education and which probably has uncertificated teachers has the same chance of getting to university as a child in another school?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already dealt with this question explicitly. In schools in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>278</span>
the industrial waist of Scotland where there is teacher shortage it is not the able pupils with families who are concerned about education who suffer. These pupils do not suffer even in schools with the most acute teacher shortage. I have already said that the geographical distribution of the pupils who are already in the fee-paying schools in Glasgow demonstrates that they do not come from areas of teacher shortage but basically from areas where the teacher supply position is good. So even from that point of view, supposing that they were to attend territorial schools, there are no fundamental difficulties about teacher shortage in these schools. I have the complete geographical breakdown on Glasgow, and the Edinburgh situation is basically the same.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While my hon. Friend is dealing with fundamental difficulties, will he not agree that one fundamental difficulty in post-primary education today is that the school leaving age is not coterminous with the length of the course?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is another difficulty about the early school leaving age. It is an important factor, but perhaps we can discuss that on another occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not possible to solve problems of teacher shortage and of particular areas simply by retaining a small number of fee-paying schools in two areas of Scotland, one of which, incidentally—Edinburgh—does not suffer from teacher shortage in any serious way. There are much more fundamental things which have to be done, and which I hope this Government, with the support of hon. Gentlemen opposite, will soon be able to do. This is a wide problem affecting whole areas of Scotland, particularly the industrial waist of Scotland, and not just one or two schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Wright) raised one or two points which I might answer. Again, he concentrated on the needs of the above average pupil. I have already said that full regard must be had to the needs of the above average pupil, but it is not possible to run the educational system we now have and to meet the demands of society by simply concentrating our efforts on the above average pupil. It is no good the hon. Gentleman paying lip service to doing the right thing by the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0601">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>279</span>
average and the less than average pupil when at the same time he concentrates his whole argument on the Amendment on the needs of the above average pupil. I said at our last Sitting that there was no evidence, and no evidence has been produced at this meeting of the Committee or at any other time, that the above average pupil, the pupil of high ability, suffers in any way at the comprehensive school. I believe that is true even in areas where there are particular difficulties about teacher supply. It has not been disputed this morning and no one has produced evidence——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eadie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will not my hon. Friend agree that the answer which he gave last week statistically bears out the point he is making?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is perfectly true, and the statistics demonstrate also that there are large numbers of pupils who go to comprehensive schools, having been judged to be in ability ranges which, under the old system, would have denied them senior secondary education, and who subsequently take their O grades and Higher grades, which is not possible under the selective system. That is not possible under the selective system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I do not believe that it is necessary to elaborate this point to any extent. We have had no evidence that the above average pupil suffers in any way from the comprehensive system. In fact, especially over the last few years as the system has been introduced, the headmasters of comprehensive schools have been punctilious in ensuring that above average pupils, whatever else happened in the schools, do not suffer from the introduction of comprehensive education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the difficulties in the early stages of comprehensive education is that of freeing ourselves from the idea, which is still widely held, that one can only judge the success of a school in terms of the number of O grade or Higher grade passes which it is able to achieve at the end of the day. In a comprehensive school, I do not believe that that can be the sole or even the most important criterion by which to judge the success of the school. That feeling is still so deeply embedded in the minds of teachers
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>280</span>
and headmasters of comprehensive schools that every effort is made to make sure that children of high ability get the maximum opportunity. There is no serious dispute on that. Even in areas or schools of teacher shortage, one finds in effect, though it is not always desirable, that priority is always given to the above average pupil, even when it has to be done to the detriment of the less able pupils. In time, we shall be able to eliminate this——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman not being a little unfair when talking about the successes of comprehensive schools in getting O grades and Highers out of lower stream pupils, bearing in mind that, particularly in Glasgow, the junior secondary schools have an outstanding record in securing O level passes from low levels of ability?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has it completely wrong factually. If he looks at the number of O grade passes published by the Scottish Certificate of Education Examination Board, and if he looks at the origins of the pupils concerned, he will find very few coming from junior secondary schools. Those who do come from schools which have built up their fourth years in moving towards comprehensive education in recent years. Virtually none came from junior schools in the traditional three-year sense. These are facts, and not arguments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Continuing with one or two of the other points which the hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollok made, I need not spend much time answering his point about the division of responsibility between local education authorities and the Government.

the hon. Gentleman paid more attention to our speeches, he would be able to answer our points more effectively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the hon. Gentleman said was that the Scottish system is different from the English one in that, in England, the direct grant schools provided a sort of middle stream when compared with grant-aided schools in Scotland. Factually, that is wrong. Proportionately, there are more pupils in grant-aided schools in Scotland that there are in direct grant schools in England. Proportionately, the grant-aided sector in Scotland is bigger than the direct grant——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I will not give way, because the hon. Gentleman would not elaborate his point. I have dealt with the point which he made on an earlier occasion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unfortunately for the hon. Member's argument, the direct grant school in England caters to a lesser extent for pupils at the secondary level than the grant-aided system in Scotland. So that even that argument has no factual basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is answering the wrong argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollok spoke about the cost being different from the cost in the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum. That cost is the cost as it is at present. He says that, if the Government had not been doing this, Glasgow would have doubled the fees. This is very much a 	<i>post hoc</i> decision, if it is a decision at all, on the part of Glasgow Education Committee. No decision of this nature has been taken, but the Education Convener said, after the Bill was published, that he had been thinking of doubling the fees. If he had doubled the fees, the arguments about their being so small that they kept no one out do not stand up to examination. I am not sure what hon. Gentlemen opposite want. Do they think that it is desirable that Glasgow should have wished to double the fees? If they put the fees up 10 times, the potential loss would be 10 times as much as at present.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>282</span>
However, we have to deal with present day facts and not with a hypothetical situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only other points which the hon. Gentleman made were about specific schools in Glasgow—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman leaves the point about the cost, he was asked specifically what would be the cost of providing a new playing field at Anniesland and Hughenden.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With regard to individual schools in Glasgow, I made it clear last week, when dealing with points put to me about individual schools in Edinburgh, that I have no intention of saying to the Committee what is to be the pattern of education in these schools after the Bill has gone through all its stages. I have made it clear more than once that the original responsibility is that of the local education authority to bring forward proposals for dealing with these schools. They were asked to do that as far back as October, 1965, at the time of the sending out of Circular 600 about comprehensive reorganisation. They were asked by me personally at meeting which I had with them to produce proposals. They will be asked by me again when the Bill has been passed. We shall see what comes forward and whether we consider their proposals acceptable. But it is not for me to tell an authority in the first instance what should be done with such schools as Allen Glen's and Hillhead High School or any other schools. If they want to discuss them individually with me, I shall be delighted to do that. When I met representatives of Edinburgh Corporation, we discussed individual schools and the problems which might be involved if they went comprehensive. But the initiative must come first from them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clark Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What will happen if Edinburgh does not agree to put forward proposals?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, that is a hypothetical situation. I do not believe that that will happen. The nature of the schools, inevitably, will be changed with the abolition of fee paying. But this is something which I shall be able to discuss with the education authority concerned once the Bill has been passed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only school mentioned specifically by the hon. Gentleman about which I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0603">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>283</span>
want to say something is Notre Dame. He raised this in terms which suggested that the Government were attacking religious freedom in education. If that was not his purpose in raising the matter, I do not know what it was. He denied it, in response to an interjection from one of my hon. Friends, but, if he did not raise it for that purpose, I see no reason why he should have raised it in the way that he did.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister answer my question? Is there not a legal contract between Glasgow Corporation and Notre Dame which guarantees the maintenance of fee paying and selectivity?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not asking the hon. Gentleman that. I was asking him his reason for raising the matter. He raised it in such a way as to suggest that there was something here affecting Roman Catholic freedom in education in Scotland. If he says that that was not his reason, I am delighted, because that is not at issue at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As an individual school, what I have said about the other schools applies to Notre Dame. I understand that there is some kind of agreement between the education authority and the trustees or the Convent of Notre Dame. I am not clear about the details of that legal agreement, but I make the same point about it as I have made in relation to other schools. If there are special difficulties in schools, I expect the education authority to let us know about them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may make a more general point about Notre Dame and Catholic education, my officials met Archbishop Scanlan and other representatives of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy of Scotland as recently as 7th February, 1969, which is less than a fortnight ago. They discussed one or two issues which will doubtless come up in subsequent Amendments. At that meeting, my officials expressly asked the Archbishop whether he wished to discuss fee paying as it was covered by the Bill. He said that he did not. It is not for me to say what may be the attitude of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy to any part of the Bill, but if this proposal represented a threat to the fabric of Catholic education in Scotland I would have been surprised if the Archbishop had not made that clear to the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>284</span>
Government at that meeting and in any letter that he sent to hon. Members. We have all received a letter from him about other issues, but he does not mention this one. I hope that we shall nail this suggestion, however cunningly put by the hon. Gentleman, that there is anything in this proposal representing a threat to Roman Catholic education in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend says, we have all received a lengthy letter from Archbishop Scanlan. To facilitate our proceedings, would my hon. Friend consider issuing to us a document on the meeting, but I can tell hon. Members that ary to the extent that it was not confidential?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That meeting was on a confidential basis in the sense that we have had meetings with others as well. It is not for me to say what happened at the meeting, but I can tell hon. Members that the matters discussed were those which subsequently Archbishop Scanlan has set out in his letter to hon. Members. It is not for me to say what was said by one side or the other, but he deals in his letter with the matters which were covered, and fee paying was not raised, although we asked whether the Hierarchy would like to discuss it with us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say that, not attempting to arrogate to myself the right to say what is the attitude of the Hierarchy to this proposition. They may be opposed to it, both in respect of Notre Dame and in other ways. But if it represented a threat of a serious nature to Catholic education which was the inference from what the hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollok said, I think that we should have heard about it before now. However, that is not the position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I have dealt with the new points, such as they were, which were raised this morning. I think that I need say nothing more now, particularly as the speeches by my hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles and my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Hannan) have dealt adequately with the points raised by hon. Gentlement opposite, in any event. We have had a long debate, and I think that we ought now to be coming to a conclusion on the matter. What we are debating here is not a major reform. However, it is an

important step forward and certainly I would ask the Committee to reject the Amendment.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Jennings, I am grateful for what you have said. I would advise the Minister and the Government Whip that we on this side will not be steamrollered in the same way as the Government wish to steamroller local authorities in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a long and wide-ranging debate, and I hope that it will be possible to reach a decision on the matter this morning. I am sure that the Minister does not object to the length of the debate, which has lasted for four Sittings. Even he must recognise that we are dealing with fundamental matters affecting the structure of education and the principles of freedom of parental choice and of freedom of local decision. Equally, the debate had to be wide ranging to do justice to the arguments advanced from both sides. I know that both sides will be grateful to you, Mr. Jennings for the latitude you have allowed us all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be helpful now if I concentrate my closing remarks, during the short time remaining to me, on the arguments which we have advanced and which the Minister did so little to answer in his long speech last Thursday and not much to improve on this morning. Indeed, he either ignored or brushed aside some of our major arguments, and during his speech on Thursday he made two statements which were misinformed, misleading, or perhaps both.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>286</span>
When I opened the debate on 6th February I said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is not primarily the fees themselves to which the Government object. What they object to is the principle of selectivity."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 6th February, 1969; c. 138.]</p></blockquote>
This point has been made by some of my hon. Friends and by hon. Gentlemen opposite, too. It is not primarily the fees which we are seeking to defend. Indeed, my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor), in a most effective speech the other day, offered to drop his defence of fees if the Government would undertake that the schools would continue as they are in all other respects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's intention is not only to abolish the fees, but to abolish these excellent schools, forcing them somehow into the comprehensive system. We have not been told how this transformation will take place. The Minister on Thursday gave us no answer, and today he has given us the worst answer of all. He says that he will wait for proposals from the local authorities. But what he must know is that he is requiring those local authorities, in the case of some of these schools, to propose the impossible or at least the impractical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask again how the Royal High School in Edinburgh, or the Glasgow High School, for that matter, are to be incorporated into the comprehensive system? Are they to be territorial schools? Has the Minister yet seriously considered the social nature of the territory that they cover? If so, would he not accept that those schools will become truly socially divisive? No attempt has been made to answer these fundamental questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) said that the Minister on Thursday had demolished the structure of our argument. He did nothing of the kind. He did not even approach the building. He spent his time wandering around the garden exploring avenues. He did not touch the main structure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not seeking to cramp the development of comprehensive schools. I should like that to be clearly understood. For us, the choice is not between comprehensive schools, on the one hand, and fee-paying schools, on the other. We
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0605">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>287</span>
believe that the two systems are compatible. In our view, both can operate together in Edinburgh and Glasgow. That is also the opinion of the local authorities in those cities. I suggest that they understand local needs far better than the Minister in his ivory tower.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The preservation of the fee-paying schools provides parents with a freedom of choice. The Minister wants to force a uniform system on the two cities to the exclusion of everything else, so removing totally the freedom of choice which exists at present, a freedom of choice which was tacitly recognised in paragraph 7 of Circular 600, which stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Parents' views on their children's education must be regarded as of fundamental importance."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Hon. Gentlemen opposite have argued that this freedom of choice is illusory. Yet I think that they must admit that the fees, by and large, are low and do not by themselves block the way to many pupils of merit. Many hon. Gentlemen have made the point that the present scale of fees in Glasgow is equivalent to about a couple of packets of cigarettes a week. No comment has been made by the Minister on the enormous cost to Edinburgh and Glasgow which this proposal would involve. It is quite extraordinary that the Government should be proposing to put a burden of over £¼ million on these two cities and on the taxpayer in general at this time in our economic history. The fact is that a substantial number of the places are free. I will return to this point in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been constant references, and again by the Minister just now, to the abolition of fee-paying schools in England and Wales. Yet there has been no serious attempt to answer the real points which have been put on this matter. I do not believe that there is any merit in bringing together the two systems. There is certainly no merit in this instance. The hon. Gentleman's comment about the middle sector—and I am glad that he made some attempt to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>288</span>
answer a comment made over a week ago—was in answer to the wrong point. The middle sector that I want to see preserved is the sector which will provide a system of choice in education for poor pupils. Indeed, this was at the centre of the regulations governing the free places in the direct grant Schools of England and Wales which sprang from the Education Act, 1944. The Minister has not touched on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that the representative of the Liberal Party should join with the Government in these views. On Thursday, the hon. Gendeman the Member for Ross and Cromarty (Mr. Alasdair Mackenzie) told us that the Government are there to govern. That was a strange doctrine for an hon. Gentleman who, the very next day, was defending a Bill the purport of which was to sound local opinion to provide guidance for the Government in their future actions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On this very point about free places the Minister, on Thursday, made a serious omission from what he told the Committee. He made no reference to the scholarships provided by many of the fee-paying schools. These represent about 10 per cent. of the places in these schools—at least in some of them. At the Royal High School the scholarships represent 10 per cent. of the places on the' secondary roll. So the hon. Gentleman, in mentioning the 20 free places at the Royal High School——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. The hon. Gentleman has stated that the Minister has not answered points. He is using this as an excuse to repeat arguments which have been put to the Committee before. On at least two occasions in the course of this speech he has made accusations against the Minister of not having dealt with points with which the Minister has dealt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. There is only one Chairman of the Committee. If the hon. Member had been out of order, either by tedious repetition, or in the matter that the hon. Member has raised, I should have pulled him up. A point of order like that is just wasting valuable time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am becoming increasingly doubtful about being able to wind up the debate this morning.

This point has not been made before, as the hon. Gentleman would appreciate if he listened.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refer the hon. Gentleman to col. 228 of the OFFICIAL REPORT.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister, in mentioning 20 free places each year, totally ignored the scholarships which amount to about a further 70 free places in the Royal High School. These scholarships are awarded on an annual basis, and, not infrequently, pupils go right through the secondary department of the Royal High School supported by them. Why did the Minister not mention them? Why did he not mention the extra five places awarded annually on the recommendation of the Rector, which represent about half the fees payable?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not the extent of the Minister's error. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There are no free places at Trinity Academy."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>First Scottish Standing Committee</i>, 13th February, 1969; c. 229.]</p></blockquote>
But there, also, scholarships are awarded to the extent of 10 per cent. of the secondary roll, representing up to 80 or 90 places. There is a similar provision in the James Gillespie High School for Girls.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why did the Minister not mention these on Thursday? I suppose the explanation must be that these scholarships are awarded on merit. They are selective. So the Minister, who dislikes selectivity, views them with contempt and thinks them unworthy of mention. But, by not mentioning them, he misinformed the Committee. I remind the Minister that when the Ministerial clock strikes 13, it casts doubt on all its previous and subsequent declarations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cry of "No freedom" from the other side is also based on the argument that a large proportion of the secondary places are reserved in some way for pupils from the primary department. That is totally false. I am sorry that the Minister made his second error on Thursday on this point. I will not read the quotation in full, because of time, but the implication of his remarks was that the secondary department has a majority
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>290</span>
of places which are pre-empted for pupils from the primary departments of those same schools. The fact is that in the Royal High School, which is typical, there are about 140 secondary places each year. These are open to every applicant. The figures vary each year, but about half the places are obtained by pupils from the primary department of the Royal High School because they qualify competitively with all others on merit. The other half of the places are won by children from other schools. Some of these children certainly come from fee-paying primary schools, but they all compete equally on merit for those places. I am sorry that the Minister should have supported what was a totally false declaration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If this freedom is removed the Government will be encouraging privilege by the purse. If there are to be no fee-paying schools, they must face the fact that some parents will want their children to go to a school other than the local territorial school, and will go to the extent of moving to within the area of the comprehensive school of their choice. This point has been convincingly made by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart and my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger), among others. The Minister may feel that the parents are wrong or misguided, but he will find that, in their contrary and inconvenient way, many people do not agree with this Government on this and other matters. If the hon. Gentleman does not realise that now, he will very soon—at the next General Election. What he and the Government are saying to parents is that the man in Whitehall knows best. Apparently the Minister believes himself to be better qualified than a parent to decide which form of education is best for the child.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is, therefore, relevant to ask what further proposals the Government have in mind concerning the freedom of choice of education in the grant-aided and independent schools. What threats hang over them?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard no educational argument for the removal of these schools. We have heard only bogus social arguments. In this matter, it is hon. Gentlemen opposite who are the dinosaurs ploutering in the marshland of social dogma.

We do not believe in forcing local authorities to follow our views in education. That is where we differ from hon. Gentleman opposite. We will have no part in this attempt to crush the will of the local authorities in Edinburgh and Glasgow. My hon. Friends and I will divide on this question today, and we</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
