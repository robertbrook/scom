	<p>	<i>Further Amendment proposed</i> [	<i>24th April</i>], No. 10, in page 8, line 23, leave out 'adopting it or'.—[	<i>Mr. Wylie.</i>]</p>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Dr. J. Dickson Mabon)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was finishing a particularly cogent and well-argued case in reply to the Amendments which were so ably proposed by the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) at our last Sitting, and I was going on to indicate the third safeguard. I was arguing that the judge and jury argument is basically misconceived, because, in the context of development, planning local authorities are acting in the public interest. They have no interest to grind and they should be trusted to act responsibly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But I accept that in certain cases it can be alleged, perhaps with some degree of belief, that it is not quite true of a particular authority. That is why I should like to impress on the Committee the fact that, while we are anxious to see this process of public participation developing properly and being really effective the Secretary of State will, nevertheless, want to watch this dialogue at all stages. He will have the power, if he is not satisfied that it is being adequately achieved, to direct that local authority not to take further steps for the adoption of the plan till it has taken further specified participation action. So that, seen against these fears, I would say that it would be a mistake to seek to make this big difference in planning legislation, taking us back to the 1947 system rather than forward to the system
	<span class='label label-info column'>246</span>
which should be in operation in the 'seventies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the hon. and learned Gentleman's point, that with the reform of local government we will be adapting many of the fundamental Statutes of local government, of which this will be one, and I also accept, therefore, that we will look at this matter afresh at that time, but for the present I feel that it would be quite wrong if we in Scotland failed to make this essential form of devolution. The days of democratic centralism are over, and because of the sheer volume and nature of work we have to devolve more and more on the local authorities. I hope that the Committee will reject these Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. G. D. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This Amendment is probably the most important that has been moved so far, and it may well be the most important in the whole Bill, because the Minister is seeking to take away from the individual who is aggrieved the right to appeal to an outside authority. I am very sorry to have to say to the Minister, who often speaks with great conviction, that I did not have the feeling either this morning or last week that he was speaking with conviction. He was doing something which he has often accused me of doing—reading an official brief. The arguments against giving the local authority the last word were expressed extremely clearly by my hon. and learned Friend. It is absolutely contrary to natural justice. I wish the Minister would listen instead of looking at his notes, because I want him to answer these points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He has not even begun to try to answer the point as to why natural justice should be interfered with. There has been no attempt to answer that point. I should like to envisage him in the situation where he wishes to carry out some development, but the local authority says, "No", because it has some other plan. This is a body which has an interest but which is judge in its own case. Think how utterly frustrated the Minister would feel. But if he could find some other body to whom he could appeal, such as the Secretary of State, he would be much more satisfied. It is part of natural justice and that is what our whole system in this country is based upon. Furthermore, the local authority is involved in local things and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0954">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>247</span>
is much closer to them than the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that the local authorities are not necessarily officials; they are elected representatives. I quite agree that some are elected representatives, but they become more closely involved when decisions are taken. It is not an impartial view which is taken when there is an appeal to the local authority which has set up a plan. It is merely the same people walking three times around the table and coming to the same answer as they came to at the beginning. It seems to me to be utterly and absolutely crazy to introduce this change when the existing system—and I am talking only about where there is appeal to the Secretary of State—has the trust of the people in Scotland. Basically, even when an answer goes against them, they trust it, and feel that matters are looked at in an impartial way. But that is never going to happen when the last word rests with the local authority which has originally taken the decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another point with which the 'Minister did not deal and which he sketched over in a most lamentable way. He never referred to the views of the local authorities. He knows perfectly well that this is something about which we feel strongly, although I want to stress that there is absolutely nothing party political in our objection here, he made no reference to what local authorities said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He did not deal with Glasgow, which is the largest city in Scotland, and yet it is specifically declared, in a letter sent to me and to other Members of Parliament, and, I imagine, to the Secretary of State, on 14th March, that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Because the structure plan is inevitably vague, and because there is no appeal at the local stage, individuals who feel that they may be aggrieved will appeal, perhaps unnecessarily, at the structure stage."</p></blockquote>
Here is the major local authority in Scotland asking that the existing system with regard to appeal to the Secretary of State should be maintained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why does Glasgow ask for that? Local authorities usually like to have more power. Has it not occurred to the Minister that it must be something very strange that makes local authorities ask not to have powers? I think it is because, from a practical point of view,
	<span class='label label-info column'>248</span>
they see difficulties, and also because they are genuinely worried that they should be party and judge in their own case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State said, quite rightly, that planning was not carried out in ivory towers and that it was most necessary to get participation. I agree with all of that, but it very often happens that the views of the planners do not accord with the views of the citizens. For example, there is the Stansted case. In my own constituency there is the problem of the Great Western Road. Fortunately, it will be possible to take this to the Secretary of State, but if the widening of the Great Western Road by Glasgow Corporation were objected to by my constituency, and after the inquiry was held the report were made to the Glasgow Corporation which came back with the same answer as before, there would be no satisfaction at all. That argument does not apply in this case, since there is going to be a public inquiry, as land is being compulsorily acquired, but the next stage will be that the Minister will say, if land is compulsorily acquired because of a local plan, "We do not need to have a public inquiry with appeal to the Secretary of State. The local authority is able to do that." That is the next logical step from what he is proposing now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State is used to acting in a quasi-judicial capacity. It is not at all easy to step outside what one feels one would like to see happen, and to look at it in a quasi-judicial capacity. Local authorities have absolutely no experience of doing this, but the Secretary of State has plenty of experience and, on the whole, he has done it to the satisfaction of the public in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has not answered any of these points and he has not even put up a good case of his own. He has not explained why it is necessary to have this change. I have had the advantage, or possibly the disadvantage, of serving not only in the Scottish Office, and of carrying out the functions which the Minister carried out before he was elevated to his present position, but in an English Department. I know that the position is utterly different there and that there is a tremendous pressure of work coming up to an English Ministry from local authorities, which it really cannot properly discharge. It gets swamped. Therefore, I accept that it may be necessary
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0955">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>249</span>
in England to depart from the ideal of an appeal to an outside body. But I do not accept that that applies in Scotland. The Minister simply did not go into this. Why does Scotland have to be treated the same as England? I do not like introducing this argument when the whole of Scotland is upset by the irrelevant activities of the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mrs. Ewing) and her friends. It is, nevertheless, perfectly true in this instance, that the situation in England is utterly different from that in Scotland, and there is no reason at all why the machinery in Scotland should follow something that is necessary and second-rate in England, as I think the Minister will admit, and not have an appeal to an outside body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that this is a great change. We are going to have a structure plan—and we accept that—and we are going to have a local plan with a lot of discussion and participation, to use the word of the moment—though what the deuce it means I do not know. All right, have a structure plan, have participation, and have all these things that the Minister wants. Then there is the local inquiry and the reporter is appointed. Nobody is objecting to that. Then the reporter makes his report just as he does today. But the Minister wants that report to go back to the local authority while I want it to go to the Secretary of State. That is the only difference between us. I merely want the report of the reporter to go to the Secretary of State rather than to the local authority against which the individual is appealing, and I cannot for the life of me see why that should not work in Scotland. The Minister has not brought forward one iota of argument to justify this change, and I should like him to say why it is necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. N. R. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister replies, may I add one or two observations on what the Minister said last week and this morning?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We recognise, of course, that the planning authority which is being given the ultimate decision is a democratically elected body. We appreciate that it is not a decision of local planning officials which is at issue here, and, indeed, it would be very objectionable if that were the case. When we come to Clause 63 we will have certain observations on the
	<span class='label label-info column'>250</span>
discretion that it is proposed will be given to officials in local planning appeals, but we recognise that that is not the situation here, and no one suggests that local planning authorities would act injudicially in considering the outcome of a local inquiry to which they are a party. But, as we have endeavoured to emphasise time and time again, although it may be that justice will be done—although the Secretary of State clearly has reservations on that, because he is reserving powers to go back to the ordinary system in certain circumstances—it will not be seen to be done in the same way as with an impartial decision by an independent third party; namely, where the Secretary of State is concerned. The hon. Gentleman must recognise that in this respect we apparently have more confidence in his right hon. Friend than he has. We are saying "Do not take it away from the right hon. Gentleman; let his Department deal with these matters, because on the whole the decisions which are taken there are decisions which are acceptable to the public."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said last week that it was not correct to argue pressure of work. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is not an expedient to reduce pressure on the central planning departments, but it is right on its own merits because it separates the broad policy issues from local planning and puts it on the local authority best suited to deal with it."[Official Report, 	<i>First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 24th April, 1969; c. 242.]</p></blockquote>
Looking at paragraph 29 of the first part of the Planning Advisory Group's Report, it is clear that pressure of work at the centre in England and Wales was one of the most significant considerations which that Committee had in mind. In paragraph 1:29 it said that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the attempt to process all these detailed plans through a centralised procedure, including provision for objections (of which there may be hundreds or even thousands on a single plan) and public local inquiry, has inevitably led to very serious delays which tend to undermine public confidence in the system."</p></blockquote>
It goes on to refer to a delay of two or three years in some cases or even longer. In that context a change had to be made. That is not satisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was a problem with which our colleagues in England and Wales were faced but it is not a problem in Scotland. If the Minister is right about this great
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0956">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>251</span>
dialogue of which we have heard so much, as he put it,
	<br><blockquote><p>"… to reduce the number of objections by persuasion and by a proper dialogue between both sides …"—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 24th April, 1969; c. 241.]</p></blockquote>
I hope that there will be less pressure at the centre after this Bill becomes law than there is at the moment. If there is no real problem at the moment the basic assumptions of this Bill tend to suggest that there will be less of a problem in the future. In this context the question of relieving pressure at the centre by delegating to local authorities the ultimate decision in objections to a plan which they have put forward is not justified either on the facts as we know them today or on reasonable anticipation for the future. In our view, it is wrong that this change should be made. It puts local planning authorities in an invidious position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested in what my hon. Friend the Member for Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith) said about the Glasgow Corporation. Local authorities will not want this power. Having promoted a plan, having insisted on the validity of that plan at a public inquiry, the local authority will have the ultimate duty to decide whether to modify or change it in any way. This is one of the crucial issues of policy in this Bill. It is not a party political matter. The Committee should be careful before invoking such a major change in policy which has no justification, and which, on the face of it, appears to run contrary to the principles of natural justice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is one aspect of the Bill about which I have certain reservations, because I feel confident that, in a number of cases which have come before me, if the local authority makes the final decision there will not be much confidence in this procedure. The ordinary objector will not be satisfied with the procedure laid down in this Bill. The arguments of my hon. Friend do not seem to me to be very convincing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The local authority draws up a plan, but there are objections; the objections are heard independently and the local authority makes the decision. This is the folly of trying to follow England in
	<span class='label label-info column'>252</span>
making legislation. We should never do this. We should judge things in Scotland on their merits and how they work in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my own constituency I cannot imagine that people who have complained and put forward objections will be satisfied with this procedure. Furthermore, this procedure will tend to undermine the possibility of getting greater public participation, because there will not be confidence in the procedure. Therefore the very aims which my hon. Friend has spoken about so convincingly, the desire for participation and discussion, will not be achieved if this procedure is kept in the Bill. It should not be kept in the Bill. I am sorry to say this because I think the Bill is a good one, but this particular part of it is quite wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I received a letter only yesterday complaining about this very business in connection with developments at Duddingston Park in Edinburgh, and asking me whether the existing procedure was to be maintained or whether it was to be changed, and the writers were anxious that it should be maintained, not because of what happened to them on appeal, but because there is greater confidence in that procedure than if the final decision is made by the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend should think about this again. I suggest that he tries to find out from other members of the Committee what their constituents feel about this. If we are contesting something with somebody we do not have much faith in the ability of the other person to make the final decision. This seems to me elementary psychology, and we could not expect people to have confidence in such a system. People want to feel that they have been fairly treated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Dickson Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with all who have spoken that this is a fundamental point, and I accept that there are a great many dissatisfactions about the present system. A great deal of the correspondence which people have had with me and with my noble Friend is about the present system, not about the new system. The most significant thing about the present system is its lack of public participation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is really not true. All this talk about public participation
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0957">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>253</span>
is not true. There could not have been more public participation about the Great Western Road. There simply could not have been, but absolutely nobody is satisfied, and if Glasgow had taken the final decision one might just as well not have had the public inquiry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That shows another distinction which the hon. Gentleman does not want to recognise. One can have a great deal of public participation but it does not necessarily follow that members of the public will accept what the local authority does. They will take the matter to public objection and public inquiry. It has been said to me many times by local authorities that they do not want consultation, they want dictation. I am in favour of participation but I am not in favour of surrendering the government of the country to any private individual or any private deputation. There is a limit to participation, and that is that the elected members decide the policy, and not individual citizens. Individual citizens have the right to elect members and to stand for election themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only correspondence I have had about the Clyde Expressway has been from the hon. Gentleman himself. The only questions in Parliament have been from the hon. Gentleman. From the general citizens of Glasgow I have received only letters of encouragement, and as for the Glasgow Corporation they are opposed to the hon. Gentleman's views on the Clyde Expressway.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is very good of the Minister to give way. I do not want to make a nuisance of myself, jumping up and down like a jack in the box, but surely the hon. Gentleman is being a little naive. The only constituency which the Great Western Road goes through is my constituency. He would not expect to hear from anybody else. I am in close touch with my constituents; they write to me, and I pass on their opinions. I hope we are not going to tie the whole debate to the Great Western Road. I merely raised that as an instance. The Minister is right that at the end of the day it is a political decision not a judicial decision, but our objection is that the wants the local politicians who are involved at the first stage to make the decision, but our objection is that he politicians who are not involved at the
	<span class='label label-info column'>254</span>
first stage and who are independent—that is, himself—to take the decision. There is a difference here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must complain about the hon. Gentleman's behaviour here. He raised this in an intervention to which I gave way a moment ago and now he is complaining about this. There are many other examples. I would expect a Glasgow Member, like an Edinburgh Member, to write about something in Glasgow which does not necessarily fall territorially in his own constituency. I get letters from people who are not Glasgow Members about what is happening in Glasgow. I have given the hon. Gentleman very considerable replies to the points he made about Great Western Road because I, too, am concerned about building an expressway along one of Glasgow's most beautiful highways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Public participation is in the adaptation of a majority to an elected minority. These arguments which the hon. Gentleman is adducing apply equally well to those who felt that the Secretary of State ought not to have these rights. There is a school of thought which says that the Secretary of State should not decide these things. I do not know who would decide them—I suppose the Court of Session. We have gone along that road too far, and we should come back and try to bring planning back to the people rather than to processes which are beyond the people. It is essential that public participation is breathed into life under this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would say to the hon. and learned Gentleman, who challenged me on the point about the administrative burden, that we in the Scottish Office run the equivalent of seven Ministries, and any Under-Secretary in the Scottish Office, even though dealing with only 5 million people, sees as great a volume of administrative work as any Parliamentary Secretary in a U.K. Ministry. I remember when I was Under-Secretary of State running nine sections, the equivalent of other Ministries, each of them quite demanding in its own right. I regard it as an immense challenge and one worthy of concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not arguing the administrative burden. The hon. Gentleman selected a sentence from paragraph 1:29 that suited
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0958">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>255</span>
him, to justify the administrative burden argument. That is not right. In reading a public document of this kind and trying to adduce an argument one should not just read the bit that says "Finally". There are two other paragraphs following, 1:30 and 1:31. Paragraphs 1:31 ends:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We conclude …"</p></blockquote>
One would imagine that some-one adducing an argument might at least turn to the conclusion, since he is not to use the whole argument. The paragraph goes on
	<br><blockquote><p>"… that the present development plan system is too detailed for some purposes and not detailed enough for other purposes. It brings before the Minister issues of major importance but in a form which may be incomplete and out of context, and also many issues of local interest which have no policy significance requiring the Minister's approval. Yet it does not provide a satisfactory medium for positive environmental planning at the local stage."</p></blockquote>
This Report was written by a U.K. Committee and submitted for discussion to all local authorities in England, Wales and Scotland. If any report was ever debated thoroughly it is this one. The local authorities had then to report and they had their conference in January, 1967. They have studied this thoroughly over the years; this Bill was not made up last year, it was made up after a great deal of study by the local authorities. There is not a shred of evidence to support what the hon. Gentleman says about Glasgow being opposed to this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Glasgow met my noble Friend, but the hon. Gentleman even misreads that. Glasgow met my noble Friend and discussed this, in the Easter Recess, and we gave assurances, some of them in reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Bridgeton (Mr. James Bennett). What the hon. Gentleman raised is the question of the publication of structure plans and the number of appeals that would follow by those concerned about what was to happen about local plans at the structure plan stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that we can try to keep calm about this. It is an important matter and we do not want to score stupid little debating points over one another. The Minister knows perfectly well what is Glasgow's objection. I will read it:
	<span class='label label-info column'>256</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"(	<i>b</i>) If there were a right of appeal to the Secretary of State in relation to the local plan proposals…."</p></blockquote>
It is complaining because there is not that right of appeal in black and white. It goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is perhaps not much point in objecting to this as a decision has already been taken in principle in the English Bill."</p></blockquote>
It feels that it is not much good talking to the Minister of State or the Secretary of State because apparently they are little lackeys—No, I must not say that; I take that back. That is the old Adam and I am trying to be a reformed character this morning. Glasgow Corporation felt that there was probably not much chance of getting this put right, because it said, a decision in principle had already been taken and the English Bill had passed into law. The Minister is not being quite fair in saying that Glasgow Corporation does not want this. It clearly does. While I am on the subject I wonder whether I may be allowed——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Interventions must be brief. Dr. Mabon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These interjections are getting enormously long, but I am sure that the hon. Gentleman feels strongly about this. He is completely misrepresenting the Glasgow position. Glasgow Corporation did not say anything like that at any time. It complained that it had not had an interview with a Minister, it asked to see a Minister long after the Bill had been debated on Second reading. My noble Friend met the Corporation during the Easter Recess. It was not at five minutes to 12, but a minute past 12 that the controlling group of the Corporation suddenly woke up to the fact that we were debating a planning Bill. There is no question of their coming along, even though they are of the hon. Gentleman's ilk, and abusing Ministers for being lackeys——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologised for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the hon. Gentleman's humble apology, and we have it on the record. He has made a great mistake. I do not know why hon. Gentlemen feed Nationalist prejudices in this way, by saying these absurd things, because they will reap the whirlwind if they sow these dragons' teeth—[	<i>Interruption</i>]—and the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) knows this to be

	<span class='label label-info column'>257</span>
true. English, Welsh and Scottish planning have always been the same in principle since planning was instituted in the United Kingdom. To go on making this point is silly. It is true that in the application of the practice of these principles we behave differently, but that is a question of method as distinct from principle. The issue of principle we are debating is whether we will have devolution from the centre, from St. Andrew's House to the local authorities. The Conservative Party appears not to want it. It appears to be saying that that should not happen in Scotland, but that it should happen in England and Wales. I disagree. I think that what is good enough for English local authorities is most certainly good enough for our people. Our people want this. I have no evidence to the contrary, and I insist that hon. Gentlemen are wrong and their arguments are misconceived.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has said that local authorities would not act injudiciously in other words there is no question of local authorities being untrustworthy or partial or prejudiced, or lacking in public concern any more than the Secretary of State, in whom the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) has declared his supreme confidence today. I am glad to have that. That is that argument gone. There is no longer an argument about the burden of administrative work. That has gone too. I have never argued that. I am arguing the pure devolution of decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On these two scores, while I share some of the anxieties that perhaps local authorities might not all rise to the occasion, there is no reason why local authorities should not in time and by experience enjoy the same high regard as that in which the Secretary of State, not just the present one but his predecessors, too, has been and is held, for his exercise of the quasi-judicial planning function. There is no reason why local authorities cannot achieve the same public esteem by the practice under this Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>We are arguing for a devolution of power from the centre which I would have thought was something upon which both parties would agree. I understood from the activities of the Conservative Party in respect of the English Bill, and from what was said on Second Reading, that we could expect hon. Gentlemen opposite to realise that local planning ought to be the preserve of local authorities, subject to the three safeguards I have described.</p>
	<p>I still believe these Amendments to be ill-founded. They would represent a fundamental departure from the published version of the Bill which we agreed with local authorities. It is not merely a textual alteration or a good suggestion, it is a fundamental departure which would cause some sense of grievance and frustration among our people, and I for one will not have it.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has been agreed on both sides that this is a matter of principle. There is no need for us to follow the new procedure being adopted in England and Wales. There is considerable disquiet that the whole procedure for objections, for reports after inquiries and for the final decision, would remain within the responsibility of the initiating local authority. There is no reflection upon the local authorities and the way in which they would act, in the same way as there is no reflection upon a court because there is an appeal to another court. The point is that, as distinct from a court, a local authority is an interested party. There must be considerable disquiet, even though every local authority acts properly in every case. There should be provision for reference to a second authority, namely, the Secretary of State, who is clearly the best man for this kind of case. I hope that the Committee will support us in this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Amendment made:</i> No. 12, in page 8, line 24, leave out '(3)' and insert '(4)'.—[	<i>Dr. Dickson Mabon.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like Clause 3, this is a very important Clause. I trust that no one feels that too much time has been spent upon these opening Clauses. Each one is clearly very important. We welcome all that is said in this Clause, as we welcome the corresponding provisions in Clause 3, with regard to publicity and discretion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister has said, this is the right approach to planning, and one certainly hopes that the dialogue about which he talks will take place on the ground and will not merely remain a pious hope set out in the Bill. I must confess that we would have been happier had the Minister been able to accept those Amendments to this Clause which were discussed at the same time as corresponding Amendments were moved in connection with Clause 3. I know that it is quite common in planning legislation to deal substantially by means of regulations, but we would have been happier and had more confidence in the working of these opening Clauses on the publicity aspect of planning if some teeth had been written in, as we endeavoured to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A lot was said by the Minister about the Amendment which we sought to move to Clause 3 and the similar one applied to this Clause. It was in closely related terms to Section 2(7) of the Countryside (Scotland) Act, 1967. This is the kind of provision which we would have liked to have seen in this Bill:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Every local planning authority shall make available for inspection by the public at all reasonable hours and without charge copies of the maps relating to their district which have been approved by the Secretary of State under this section, including any amendments of those maps which have been approved as aforesaid, and copies thereof, including reproductions on such scale as may be appropriate, shall be made available by them on sale to the public at a reasonable cost."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>260</span>
I hope when regulations are made dealing with Section 3 and Section 7, as they will then be, such regulations will be made along those lines, because in practice it will be difficult for an individual or even his professional advisers to give proper consideration to what is being proposed, particularly in regard to the written statement which constitutes the structure plan, but also with regard to the planning proposals constituting the local plan.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archie Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It appears to me that during the discussion on the last Amendment both the hon. and learned Gentleman and his hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith) were not dealing with this but rather with the adoption, and they wanted the Secretary of State to give in on this issue. It is obvious that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Hillhead has not read Clause 9(3), because that gives ample protection. Perhaps I may be allowed to read it:
	<br><blockquote><p>"After copies of a local plan have been sent to the Secretary of State and before the plan has been adopted by the local planning authority, the Secretary of State may direct that the plan shall not have effect unless approved by him."</p></blockquote>
That contains a total safeguard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the point which the hon. Member wishes to make, but an intervention should not be as long as that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I rise on a point of order, Sir Barnett?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to appear to be lacking in courtesy to you, who are so welcome to preside over these great matters relating to Scotland, but there have been two occasions this morning when interventions by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith) were quite as long as mine and you did not make a Ruling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I have been a little remiss. I appreciate the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0961">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>261</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the point which the hon. Gentleman is making, but it does not arise out of the point I was making. I was dealing with the question of publicity. He is right in saying that the discussion we had, and under which we voted, arises by way of paving Amendments to Clause 7 and in Clause 9. That is not to say that we are going through all those again. We recognise the point he has made, and I said at the last meeting, and also today, when we were dealing with the question of leaving it to the local authorities, that they are perfectly capable and will act judiciously, but I said that the Secretary of State has a lingering doubt about that because he has reserved powers to himself in Clause 9(3), where he is saying that in certain circumstances he may have to call this in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our argument is on the Amendments which really related to Clause 9 although the way in which the Bill is framed meant that they arose on Clause 7, and I do not intend to go over that argument again. We believe that however judicial a local authority may try to be it is always better to allow a dispute to be taken by a party other than one of the two parties to the dispute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of publicity, with which this Clause is mainly concerned, we would have liked this Clause to have been strengthened along the lines of the proposals we put in Clause 3, but since that was not to be, I hope that when regulations are made an attempt will be made to translate the general statements of intention in this Clause into something that is really worth while, and that there will be provision by regulations to have available for copying and for purchasing at a reasonable price those kinds of provisions which in practice will mean a lot in the working out of his otherwise desirable Measure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make clear to the Minister that we are not opposed to the main object of this Clause, which is publicity in the preparation of local plans. We are not against devolution of authority, and we are not against participation. What we do feel is that appeal should not be to the local authority but to some outside body. As the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) rightly said, with all the authority of an ex-Minister, individuals no longer have the same confidence
	<span class='label label-info column'>262</span>
that they had previously. Can the Minister say that if there had not been the pressure in England and we had only been considering the sort of situation that exists in Scotland, this particular change with regard to appeal—and we accept the other changes in regard to publicity and participation—would have been made? It seems to me that most of the P.A.G. Report is concerned with the conditions in England, and the summary naturally refers to that rather than to Scotland. I do not think the Minister is being quite fair in this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman will recollect that this actual Group was established by his own Government. It was established by the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) and the right hon. Member for Leeds, North-East (Sir K. Joseph) who was then the Minister of Housing and Local Government. The Group reported in 1965 when my right hon. Friend the present Secretary of State for Social Services was the Minister of Housing and Local Government. I had the privilege of going with him on behalf of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland to the meeting where we said "Thank you" to the whole Committee who had produced this Planning Advisory Group Report. I was proud of the faot that there were so many distinguished Scotsmen there. While some were there in the capacity of Scots in regard to their official positions, others were distinguished in the professions. There comes to mind the name of Mr. Hugh Wilson, who did so well in the planning of the new town of Irvine. There was also Professor Grieve, who represented the Department at one time, before he moved on to become Chairman of the Highland Board. Also there was Professor Nicol who was the chief planning officer of the Department, actually appointed when he was the deputy director of planning in Glasgow, and who has since moved on to become a professor at Strathclyde University.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I insist that a great deal of the argument on Clause 7 has been lost sight of because of the essential arguments of merit in devolving local plans on to the local authorities. I can only say that if hon. Gentlemen have misunderstood this rather difficult debate on Clause 7 I hope on reflection they will see that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0962">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>263</span>
their position is an unwise one, and I will take it that they want to see regulations made which are as reasonable and sensible as possible, and that they will do all they can to maintain public participation on the scale thought of in Part I of the Bill, with particular reference to Clause 7. If public participation fails, either because the public do not give an iota unless their own immediate property interest is threatened; if that is the only sphere in which the public will react; or if elected councillors and officials will not genuinely try to present their plans at the early stages; or if it happens that Members of Parliament and others will not help in this; then the whole thing will fail and there may be an argument for reverting to the 1947 system, with its horde of public inquiries, in which the only way to obtain public participation was to be an objector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not possible to have the Minister's system with the local council and everybody taking part? We hope there will not be nearly so many appeals because of the participation, but where there is an appeal, why can it not be under the present system?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because one would reduce the authority from a substantial authority having to be judicious in weighing the interests of the community with the interests of private individuals who want to object for quite legitimate reasons. One would reduce the substance of that to the shadow of a mere performer of certain apparent rights which they did not have, in other words proposing but not disposing. I hope the Opposition will realise how they would be treating local authorities, as having second-grade status and being not worthy of real trust or power. In other words, devolution of necessity rather than on merit. The local authorities who have worked with us since the publication of this Report are confident that, given the chance and good will, and reasonable regulations, they will be able to carry this out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not because the Minister has so much to do in England whereas in this respect the Scottish Ministry has not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>264</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the fifth time, no. The hon. Gentleman is a classical example of a man convinced against his will.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not agree.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Arising out of the Minister's remarks with regard to the attitude of the Opposition, is he saying that for over twenty years successive Governments have treated local authorities contemptuously because of the provisions of the 1947 legislation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In fairness to the local authorities, they have not had planning provisions which entitled them to have the sort of participation which would go with this devolution. I agree with my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) that to devolve under the 1947 Act would be easier because it does not carry with it the obligation which can be imposed by the Secretary of State to have proper public participation at all the stages leading to the formulation of a plan. If one is going to insist on public participation one should be able to trust to the local authorities to carry out their responsibility.

This Clause is a keystone of the Bill. It is a touchstone of one's willingness to see if the local authorities are likely to react well to this new system. Some people go in with a certain amount of unease because they are not sure that local authorities will carry out these functions properly. However, there are three conditions in which they will be carried out successfully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first is that we write the regulations sensibly and wisely, and in that connection we look to the Skeffington Committee for advice. The regulations will be subject to the negative resolution procedure, of course, but in our preliminary discussions we should consider what is in the Skeffington Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0963">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>265</span>
The second condition is that the local authorities carry out the regulations loyally and work them in the spirit in which the Skeffington Committee recommends them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third condition is that right hon. and hon. Gentlemen opposite give the local authorities a fair chance, help them and seek to play fair with them when it comes to any question of a public inquiry. After the extensive debate that we have had, it would be wrong if right hon. and hon. Gentlemen opposite left the local authorities with the impression that they would be attacked if they sought to carry out this Section.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to see good will here. The Bill has been through the other place, where it has had an opportunity to be scrutinised, and it has to be scrutinised thoroughly here. The fact is that we in this Committee have to decide whether we will agree to work the Bill, even though right hon. and hon. Gentlemen opposite disagree on fundamental points. I am convinced that we were right to stand up to this assault on the local authorities and say that what devolution there has been in England should take place in Scotland. I think that it will be shown to be sensible and wise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>INQUIRIES, ETC. WITH RESPECT TO LOCAL PLANS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 16, in page 9, line 17, leave out from 'State' to 'and' in line 19.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By this Amendment we seek to leave out the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"or. in such cases as may be prescribed by regulations under this Part of this Act, by the authority themselves ".</p></blockquote>
The words "by the authority themselves" refer to the appointment of a person to hear a local inquiry. The person can be appointed either by the Secretary of State or, as in this provision, subject to certain conditions, by the authority itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to elaborate the argument again, because it touches on the position of a local authority, as a party to a dispute, being the authority which ultimately decides the dispute. Bad as that may be, it would be even worse if it were not only left to decide the issue itself but to appoint the person to hear the dispute. It is a refinement of the main argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no reason for a provision of this nature to be in the Bill. If the Secretary of State is to devolve this work on to local authorities, presumably he should take the trouble to appoint the person who is to hear the preliminary inquiry. Given that the proposed system is to be put into operation, it would be far better if at least the person holding the inquiry was appointed by an authority other than one of the parties to the dispute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to support my hon. and learned Friend for the reasons that he has given. The Minister keeps on failing to grasp our point. It is not that we do not trust the local authorities, but, as my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) pointed out, that we are more interested in justice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0964">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>267</span>
It has been pointed out already that an appeal from one court to another does not mean that one does not trust the first court. When we ask that the Secretary of State should appoint the reporter, that does not mean that we do not trust the local authorities, but that we are interested in justice. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will make this small alteration, because I would prefer the right of appeal to be to an outside body.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed at hearing yet another attack on the good sense of our local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It goes beyond that on this occasion, because normally a member of the legal profession will be appointed, and I am sorry that the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) should think that there is any shade of doubt that the person appointed would play up to the local authority in some way. Is that not a reflection on his own profession? Usually, the person in charge of such an inquiry is a member of the legal profession.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not so much what will happen which concerns us, but what one of the parties feels may happen. If he has a quarrel with his local authority and the local authority not only judges the issue but appoints the reporter, will he not feel that something may go wrong? Will he not be more confident if an outside body appoints the reporter from a panel chosen by the Secretary of State or, alternatively, if he knows that the appeal is to another party?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are certain protections under the regulations as to who shall be appointed. The hon. Gentleman is talking of a panel which, presumably, will be composed of members of local authorities. In such circumstances, it might be that a member of a local authority in the hon. Gentleman's constituency would come to Ayrshire and preside over a hearing and listen to objections which we may have. I am afraid that I cannot subscribe to his doubts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again speaking from past experience as chairman of a planning committee, I would feel a little unhappy at having to move in that com-

mittee the appointment of a reporter knowing that possibly the chairman, members of the committee and the officials present would be called as the chief witnesses. There would be a great deal more happiness within such a committee if it knew that there could be no possible criticism from the public because it was known that the reporter was an independent person. I have no doubt that any reporter appointed would be perfectly independent but, in this world of public relations in which we live, it is very much better for such a reporter to be seen to be independent of the local authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) has taken this opportunity to speak again as the ex chairman of a local planning authority. He was such a formidable support to me on the last occasion that I welcomed his rising on this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, he has never been chairman of a planning committee which was in this position. This limited Amendment is saying that in no case will a local planning authority, under regulations, appoint a reporter. At present, a reporter is a person who reports to the Secretary of State his findings on the basis of agreed facts and his examination of witnesses in public. That is Part I of his report. Then, in Part II, he assesses the position as the reporter. However, the Secretary of State is not obliged to accept his verdict, because he may not know certain facts. Other circumstances may influence the Secretary of State, all of which he is obliged to recite when issuing his decision letter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we accept that there should be a public inquiry against the formal plan of a local authority, which has done its best to explain what it means, and the person concerned still objects and wants a hearing by an impartial person, this Amendment is designed to say that in no case will the local authtority be able to appoint that person. This would be a breach of the principle which we follow at present. A reporter appointed by the Secretary of State would be reporting to the local authority and, while there is a case for saying that in some circumstances such a person should be appointed by the Secretary of State, there are other circumstances in which a local authority should be able to choose such a person from a list drawn up by the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Gentleman tell us the class of case which he envisages would be appropriate to be heard by a reporter appointed by the Secretary of State, and the class of case which he regards as appropriate for decision by a reporter appointed by the local authority under these provisions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think it would rest on the scale and significance of the particular matter that was the subject of the inquiry. In other words, there are large issues and smaller issues and it would depend to some extent on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After all, the Secretary of State is not obliged to appoint a reporter under this proposed statute. He will be given the right to appoint a reporter in certain cases. What the hon. and learned Gentleman is saying is that never in any case—on however small a scale, however lacking in significance it may be—can a local authority appoint a reporter for its own inquiry. I suggest that that is not following out the sense of devolution here, because, again, the reporter is reporting to the local authority which must assess the value of his report, both the first section dealing with the facts so far as he can elucidate them, and the second section dealing with his views in accordance with what he has heard at the inquiry, what he knows in relation to public policy and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the suggestion is that the local authority is partisan, is not going to administer justice, is going to cheat at every conceivable turn, then I freely confess that justice will never be done. But even with the deletion of these words, justice would never be done if that were the case. But I do not accept that, any more than I accept the argument that the Secretary of State cheats, as do all those in his office, and is partisan, partial and so on. We are dealing here with a public authority which is acting as trustee for the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a sense, this is the last ditch of the argument against devolution. There is nowhere else to go after this. I suggest that either we devolve cleanly and clearly and comprehensively, giving the local authorities real concern and obligation in this, or we start to qualify and so on. I think they have the right to have imposed on them the duty to select from a
	<span class='label label-info column'>270</span>
group of reporters a person who will carry out impartially and well an inquiry to which they will listen, and the report of which they will read and pay attention to, before they come to their decision on the local plan. Accordingly, I ask the Committee not to make this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister talked about devolving cleanly, but I wonder whether he can explain why it is necessary to do this in regard to planning, although it is perfectly appropriate to have an appeal from the Court of Session to the House of Lords, without in any way infringing the authority or the quality of the Court of Session. We are not arguing about devolving. Devolve as much as you like. We wish to have something independent when it comes to the appeal stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think you will agree with me, Sir Barnett, that we are now back to the original argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is part of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are now arguing about a very narrow issue. If matters ever went to the Court of Session or any further, there would be arguments on points of law. That is why it is very important to draw up these statutes precisely, and not to have any woolly phrases if we can avoid them. I accept that, but that is not what we are arguing now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Gentlemen, having been taken to this point, where we are seeing local plans dealt with in this way, must ask, should a local authority be denied in every circumstance the right to appoint a reporter from a specified list agreed by the Secretary of State? I am saying that it is not fair to local authorities to deny them this right in all cases. I accept that there are some cases, depending on scale and significance, where the Secretary of State ought to appoint a reporter. He may be requested so to do and he may insist on doing it. But, conversely, there are some cases where the local planning authority should have the right to do this. I plead with hon. Gentlemen, even though they do not agree with the principle, at least to accept that if the principle is in this Bill then the practice of it ought to be fair and equitable to the local authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister said, this is a narrow point. As I openly conceded
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0966">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>271</span>
at the beginning, it is a refinement of the main argument as to whether the local authority should be the body which decides a dispute to which it is a party. But when the Minister talked of resisting an assault on the local authorities, and suggested that the argument was that the local authorities were going to cheat, and argued that we must either devolve cleanly or not at all, then that is a kind of Glasgow University Union debating technique which is not worthy of this Committee, because we have never on this side of the Committee suggested that we were making an assault on local authorities. Indeed, we were endorsing our respect for local authorities by giving them credit for the way they have operated the 1947 legislation for twenty years. No one on either side has suggested for one moment that local authorities cheat, or that they would appoint someone who would be in their pocket. That would be a mean and irresponsible argument, and I want to make it perfectly clear that that is not an argument that has been adduced from this side of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we do say is that, where any procedure is developing which is going to result in a decision being taken on an issue in which two sides have two different views, then justice has not only to be done but to be seen to be done. Our only criticism of this proposal is that it is not going to appear to be quite so impartial a decision if it is made by someone appointed by the local authority, which is one of the parties to the dispute, as if it were a decision by a person appointed by the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman knows quite well that our provincial Press deals with the county councils who are the major planning authorities for all the burghs in their areas. If something happened it would be fully reported in the local Press, and it would get all the publicity that we want. It would be reported that the local authority was choosing a person from a list submitted by the Secretary of State and everyone would be fully satisfied, even if the hon. Gentleman was not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the hon. Gentleman's argument is that because the local authority's discretion is circumscribed, contrary to what the Minister said about
	<span class='label label-info column'>272</span>
devolving cleanly to local authorities, the edge is taken off this argument. I accept that, and it is a narrow point. The only question is: does the local authority appoint a reporter from a list provided by the Secretary of State, or is it not much cleaner and simpler to let the Secretary of State appoint someone?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In all cases?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In all cases, yes. The hon. Gentleman said that the Secretary of State could not do it, but the Secretary of State is bound to do it, because there is a statutory obligation on the local authority to hold a public inquiry if there are objections which are not withdrawn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It really comes to this. In that situation who is going to have the inquiry? Is it going to be a person appointed by the local authority from a list, or is it going to be a person appointed by the Secretary of State? There is very little practical difference. On balance, it would look better if the person were appointed cleanly, as it were—to use the hon. Gentleman's phrase—by an independent third party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister talked about the reporter reporting to the local authority. May I ask him wherein lies that provision? There is no provision in this Clause or in the following one, for the reporter to report to the local authority. The only provision is to the effect that if there has been an inquiry the local authority will take the decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. and learned Gentleman will be good enough to look at subsection (1)(	<i>b</i>) he will see a reference to the Tribunals and Inquiries Act, 1958. It clearly follows from that, therefore, that the report should go from the reporter to the local planning authority. I accept the hon. and learned Gentleman's nattering references to me in relation to my time at Glasgow University, but not in the way he meant them. I spent five years at that university, and the hon. and learned Gentleman did, too, although I learned a lot more than he did. I have also spent a long time in this Committee—some would think too long. But I should not like him to imagine that Glasgow University would respond very favourably to that kind of remark about cheap techniques and debasing this Committee. Flattery, my dear boy, will get

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know that it is in order to talk about those merits and demerits in this debate on this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged. But I do not like my old university and college to be attacked in such a sordid way by the hon. and learned Gentleman, who must be very desperate for arguments when he is now descending to abuse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman wants to deny the authorities the right to appoint their own reporter. I reject that. I think it is unfair and wrong. I really cannot go on much longer with this argument. It is the last ditch, and the hon. Gentlemen are getting very muddy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed.</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a very exhaustive argument on the main substance of this Clause but I should just like to raise two points. I should like to reinforce very strongly indeed what my hon. and learned Friend said in relation to the last Amendment, and so far as this side of the Committee is concerned there is no assault whatsoever on local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our concern about this Clause is that it puts local authorities in an invidious position. We welcome the delegation which the Minister of State believes he is making, but we want to make sure that it works. That is the point of the Amendment which we have moved to this Clause. But the method used by the Minister of State is not going to help the work of the local authorities at all. We trust the local authorities thoroughly to do their job competently and honestly. What we are seeking to do is to avoid exposing them to unnecessary criticism. It is all very well for the Minister of State to argue that members of a local planning committee are elected, and that at the end of the day the ratepayers can throw them out if they dislike the way they have dealt with planning decisions, but democracy in local government does not work as simply as that, and there could be a lot of ill feeling if what they were doing was not seen to be done
	<span class='label label-info column'>274</span>
openly and with complete justice. That is why we criticise the wording of this Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I want to return to a point raised by the Minister of State when he said that local authorities themselves raised no objections to the provisions of this Clause. He gave the impression that nobody outside this Committee objected to the way the Clause is worded, and I should like him to correct me if I am wrong, but I should like to draw his attention to a letter written to his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State by the Dundee Chamber of Commerce, in which it raised very substantial objections of the same nature as we have raised to the Clause as it stands at the moment. The Dundee Chamber of Commerce is an eminently reasonable body, and has branches in my own constituency and in that of my hon. Friend the Member for South Angus (Mr. Bruce-Gardyne). Therefore, it simply is not true to say that there are no objections outside this Committee to the provisions of this Clause. I hope that in reaching his decision the Minister of State has taken account of these objections, and is aware of the objections which have been raised by local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want this Clause to work, and we want to give local authorities powers of delegation, but we are also very concerned that the general public will understand them and will give their wholehearted support to what the local authority is doing, because they believe it is right. At the moment we question whether they will appreciate what the local authority is trying to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged to the hon. Gentleman for his remarks. Certainly, they are not quite in tune with what we have had in the debate. However, I accept that the Opposition have had a very quick change of mind, which was, no doubt, prompted by the very valuable intervention, which I welcomed, of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison), when he put the 64,000 dollar question to the Opposition, and asked: would they change this legislation if by some mischance they carne into power? But there was no answer to that—an eloquent reply, indeed, to the kind of debate that we have had this morning.

12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I accept that we had many representations from bodies other than local authorities corncerning the Bill it does not follow that local authorities have exactly mirrored all these objections. For two years we studied this Measure before we brought it to Parliament. No Bill has been treated in such a thorough way, and I know of no segment of local authorities opposed to this devolution of power. A small burgh or district council, perhaps, has not brought its representations to my notice. As for the representations of others, certainly it is important that we look into all the opinions, but in the last analysis the Government have to make the proposal to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman is sincere, as I think he is, in what he says, he thinks local authorities will do this well and that they ought to be trusted, and if they do it with enthusiasm as well there is no reason why it should not succeed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman recognise that if there is no representation from local authorities themselves, many others who have made representations are the very people affected by the planning decisions of local authorities and that it is important that their point of view should be taken into account?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must recognise that the Minister receives hundreds or possibly thousands of representations, and although there are fifty planning authorities there are many other bodies interested in planning and the Minister has to weigh up all the arguments 	<i>ad hominem</i> and try to come to an assessment. Simply to quote one against all the rest without knowing all the rest is, as I have advised the Committee, the wrong way of proceeding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have looked again at the recommendation of the Dundee Chamber of Commerce, but that does not change my view that these Clauses of the Bill are good. Part I is an essential part of the Bill and Clause 8 is an important part of Part I.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are partly probing Amendments, because subsection 4(	<i>b</i>) tends to invite a question as to whether what is proposed is altogether wise. It is proposed that where the Secretary of State gives a direction under the preceding subsection the local planning authority has to submit the plan to him for his approval. This is a case where, despite all that has been said by the Minister and others about devolution and letting local authorities do the job, the Secretary of State decides that they cannot do the job and he is going to do it for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that situation the position appears to be that, before the Secretary of State decides whether or not to approve the plan he
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall not be obliged to consider any objections thereto if objections thereto have been considered by the authority …"</p></blockquote>
If the Secretary of State is going to make a decision on this matter why should he not have to refer to objections thereto even though these objections may have been considered by the local authority? There may be nothing in this, but, on the face of it, it invites the question, if people are objecting to a plan, and if the local authority is being told by the Secretary of State that he will decide the issue, why should the Secretary of State not consider the objections?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He shall not cause a local inquiry to be held if that has already been held. That is sensible. There has to be a terminal point at which public inquiries shall be held, and if one has already been held that would be enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the Amendments would be that the paragraph would read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"before deciding whether or not to approve the plan, the Secretary of State shall consider any objections thereto which have been considered by the authority"—</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0969">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>277</span>
there is a drafting point which might merit some attention—
	<br><blockquote><p>"but he shall not be obliged to cause an inquiry to be held …"</p></blockquote>
It is with these considerations in mind that this small group of Amendments is proposed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having listened carefully to what the hon. and learned Gentleman has said I do not disagree with the point. It is quite in accord with the aims of this subsection. The intention of the existing paragraph is to make it clear that if the calling in takes place at a late stage the Secretary of State need only look at the plan and decide in the light of what has already been done towards consideration of the plan whether or not to approve it. A late call in would be exceptional. Normally the Secretary of State will decide when he first sees the plan whether it is one he needs to reserve for his own decision. The circumstances provided for in this paragraph are. the unusual ones where for some reason a plan is called in after it has gone a considerable way towards adoption. This might happen where further factors arose which needed wider consideration, or if strong public feelings were aroused. I accept the point that these could be reasonably regarded as drafting Amendments which it would be sensible to make, and I am happy to accept these three Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am slightly worried about the wording of this Clause. There are a tremendous number of cross-references in subsection (3). There is a reference to the provisions of Sections
	<span class='label label-info column'>278</span>
6(9) to (11), 7, 8, and 9, and later in this subsection there is further reference to other Sections and subsections, and to some extent the wording of this Clause makes difficult reading. I wonder if it is possible to make it slightly simpler. The number of cross-references makes it difficult later for people to understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Coming to the more general aspects, I welcome that in this provision for alteration to local plans the Minister of State is introducing a simpler form of amendment. On the point of the alteration of structure plans, I would ask the Minister to give us an assurance that, when alterations are made in local plans, in any regulations made he will ensure that adequate publicity is given. It is at the level of the local plan that ordinary people are affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Take the case of somebody who has looked at the local plan and in the light of it may decide to buy a house or piece of land in a certain area. If the plan is altered it may put a completely different light on his original decision. So it is important that everybody has the chance to know when alterations are proposed. I hope the Minister will give us an assurance that when regulations are made the publicity is as adequate and thorough as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One final point. This, again, is important in relation to the local plan. A person may buy a house or piece of land in the light of what he knows is in the local plan, but because that plan is detailed he may not go and get planning permission for some future development which he may have in mind. If the local plan is altered it may throw quite a different light on his decision, and because he has not already applied for planning permission he has no means of getting compensation. We have to bring home to people in some way or another the fact that the local plan as it stands does not necessarily protect a person's rights, and, in addition, he would have to get planning permission for any alteration he may wish because of an alteration in the plan.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0970">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>279</span>
dozens of complaints from owner-occupiers who have bought houses or bungalows on estates, and, after a short time, have discovered that the local authority plans have been altered. This has caused many of them great disquiet, and often considerable loss of amenity. They had imagined that they were buying an amenity created by the plan, but that amenity was very often undermined by changes in local authority planning. I could quote dozens of cases in my constituency over the last sixteen years, and I am sure that it must happen in many other constituencies. I hope that, in preparing any orders relating to this Clause, my right hon. Friend will try to find a way by which any proposed alterations to domestic or commercial proposals can be fully advertised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had a case in my constituency in the Burgh of Milngavie, where it was proposed to remove a belt of trees which acted as a shield against an industrial estate, built adjacent to some council and owner-occupied houses. That belt of trees constituted a selling factor for those houses. Fortunately, the Secretary of State disagreed with the proposal and the majority of the trees were preserved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This sort of thing causes anxiety, and I hope that, if any alterations are made to plans which have been discussed in public, when eventually everyone has been satisfied about them, these fresh alterations will be put before the public with as much if not greater consultation and publicity as were the original proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to support my hon. Friend for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) and the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Bence). The Minister of State will recall that on Clause 7 we were interested in publicity, and were concerned that everyone should know what was proposed. Our Amendment was defeated, but he kindly undertook to make very strict regulations setting out the mechanics to be used for informing the public. In this Clause, when there is a change in a plan, will the same care be taken as he has promised on Clause 7? If he can give me that assurance I will be very grateful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, if a proposal has been looked into, and a decision made, can the Min-
	<span class='label label-info column'>280</span>
ister of State tell me for how long that decision will last? I am interested in a case in my own constituency involving open spaces. A decision was made, and now we have the local authority coming back, within two years, to try to do what it was prohibited from doing earlier. Will this sort of thing be covered by this Clause, or will there be other arrangements?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You were not here on the last occasion, Sir Barnett, when I gave an assurance to the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) about something; a very firm assurance it was, for which he has expressed his appreciation today; yet immediately after that there was a vote. I am not awfully keen on giving assurances now in case there are votes. Following Parliamentary convention, I suppose that I ought not to do anything about assurances nullified by a vote. However, I certainly adhere to that assurance. It is a very important matter, and should be looked into carefully. I forgive the hon. Gentleman for stampeding his own side into voting very rashly on that occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I give the assurance that, in as much as there are modifications of the local plan—and here I am talking also to my hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Bence)—under the Clause, they should be given the same adequate amount of publicity as the original plan received.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would be wrong if I led the hon. Gentleman into thinking that that covers everything in planning. I know from correspondence with him and other colleagues of his in Edinburgh, Dunbartonshire and other parts of the country, that real friction is not concerned with development plans, but with minor changes of planning use or of development of one kind or another. It is difficult to reduce this area of friction, but I agree it has to be done. I very much doubt whether it can be done on the same lines as are proposed here. I do not want the hon. Gentleman to think that I am giving him an assurance that his post will now fall as to this item of friction. I do not think it will, not for some time, not till we can develop better techniques and get better local administration and publicity, involving the proposals of one individual as against another, which would be of a

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman, no doubt, has in mind applications under Section 12 of the 1947 Act. Would not one of the ways round this be to require intimation of adjoining properties in the same way as under the dean of guild legislation? I have been trying to think of a method whereby we could raise this point. If the hon. Gentleman, with his expertise behind him, could do something, my hon. Friends would be grateful, because it is a difficult point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was going on to hint that the one way of doing this is perhaps coming out of Skeffington in the form of regulations of some kind or another dealing with this other matter, which is not strictly part of this Clause. I give the assurance about modification and publicity. I do not think that will resolve the problem. We will have to take it a stage further when the Skeffington Report is published, and we will have to look at the regulations including the useful suggestion made by the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I disagree with the first comment by the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith). Subsection (3) is admirably written and I do not see how it could be redrafted in a better form. Texturally it is quite right to come in there, since preceding subsection of the Measure would have been read before, by an intelligent reader. If someone is consulting the Measure and does not read the foregoing subsections and then comes upon this, clearly they will have to read the foregoing subsections to understand it. I cannot offer the hon. Gentleman the slightest mede of amelioration to that plain "no" to the first part of his question.

I have already answered the second part. I agree with him. I did not quite follow his third point. I did not quite understand what he was after.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I am thinking of is a case where someone purchases a piece of land for a development purpose, and under the plan as it stood, it would be open for him to carry that development forward.

that man had in mind. If he had got precise planning permission he could have received compensation, because it would have been a change in planning consent. I agree that it is his responsibility, but because it is the local plan he may be lulled into a sense of false security. The ultimate responsibility rests with him, I know, but I use this to illustrate how important it is that publicity should be given to alterations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 121, in page 12, line 23, leave out 'Without prejudice' and insert 'Subject'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a probing Amendment, to enable the Minister to confirm the view that I have on this provision, that there is nothing inconsistent between the opening terms of this subsection and the discretion given to planning authorities under Clauses 3 and 7. This point was raised earlier by the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis), and I have such respect for any matter he raises that I thought it would be better to make sure that it is all right. I think it is. As far as I can see, under Clauses 3 and 7 the local authority has a duty to be satisfied on the question of adequate publicity, but it is given a discretion as to what will constitute adequate publicity. This subsection provides that notwithstanding these discretionary powers and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0972">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>283</span>
statutory obligations, the Secretary of State may make regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it the Secretary of State may make regulations, 	<i>inter alia,</i> providing for publicity, but notwithstanding those, the local authority still has to be satisfied under the provisions of Clause 3 or 7, as the case may be. In other words, it cannot just sit back on compliance with the regulations and say that there is adequate publicity. It must satisfy itself that adequate publicity is being achieved, notwithstanding any regulations made by the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that this Amendment is a probing one, and I do not dissent from what the hon. and learned Gentleman has said about the coexistence, if I may call it that, of these Clauses, particularly the co-existence of Clause 3 with Clause 13. I do not think that this quite meets the point made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis), but I have no intention—I would not be so presumptuous—of making my right hon. Friend's speech for him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. and learned Gentleman is seeking to meet my right hon. Friend's point, then I do not think that he achieves it. I do not know whether that was his intention, but we must weigh up what ought to be inserted here. I do not see what practical difference it would make. It might be argued that it would tend to make Clause 13 more subordinate to the provisions of Clause 3 than as at present drafted, and that might inhibit the scope of the regulations. If that were so, I am sure that the hon. and learned Gentleman would consider that to be undesirable, because these Clauses are co-equals. There is no question of the superiority or the inferiority of one to the other. They have to exist together. I do not see how this meets my right hon. Friend's point. I have a certain amount of sympathy for it, but I do not know whether we can do anything about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This Amendment makes no difference at all to the meaning of the Clause. I was interested in what my hon. Friend said about Clauses 13 and 3 having an equal value. Here we say
	<span class='label label-info column'>284</span>
that subject to the foregoing provisions of this part of the Act the Secretary of State may make regulations with respect to the formulation of content, and so on. In Clause 3 we give the local authority powers to do the same things. They
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall take such steps as will in their opinion secure"</p></blockquote>
certain things which are in fact set out in subsection (1) in this Clause. I cannot see how these two Clauses can run together. Either the Secretary of State has an overriding power to say what could be done, or the local authority has. In my opinion Clause 3 ought to be amended to say,
	<br><blockquote><p>"Subject to regulations issued by the Secretary of State under Section 13"</p></blockquote>
or whatever it may be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I raised this point when we discussed this matter previously, but I still have not received a satisfactory answer. I do not profess to understand legal terminology, but it seems to me that, if both parties have equal powers, we shall be creating confusion, and I should have thought that confusion could be cleared up quite easily in Clause 3 simply by inserting the words I have suggested. Otherwise I cannot see how the local planning authority can have authority to do the things set out in Clause 3, and do them in a manner which in its opinion, and not in the opinion of the Secretary of State, will achieve the aims of the Clause. I am afraid my hon. Friend still has not explained this to my satisfaction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: From what the right hon. Gentleman has said I understood the difficulty he is raising. Because, in my view, it was an unreal difficulty I tried to clear it up. It seems to me that the local authority must be satisfied under Clause 3 as to what constitutes adequate publicity, but that does not mean that it can ignore regulations made by the Secretary of State. The converse is that although it complies with regulations made by the Secretary of State that does not absolve the local authority from satisfying itself that adequate publicity is being given. It must comply with regulations made under Clause 13, but must also satisfy itself under Clause 3 that adequate publicity is given. It seems to me, and I am glad that the Minister
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0973">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>285</span>
shares this view, that there is no inconsistency between Clause 3 and Clause 13. It was in order to make that clear that this purely probing Amendment was moved, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Question is——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh, no, Sir Barnett. My hon. Friend cannot get away with it like that. I have asked him a question, and surely I am entitled to an answer?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend and I have discussed this, but it is a different issue from the one we are now debating. It is an issue worthy of consideration at some later stage, but at the moment I really would not like to comment on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 114, in page 13, line 5, leave out from "notice" to end of line 7.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is another probing Amendment. I have some difficulty in tying up subsection (1)(	<i>b</i>) with subsection (1)(	<i>d</i>) The former provides for the notice to be given, and regulations may provide for notice to be given or for publicity to be given to matters included or proposed to be included in the plan,
	<br><blockquote><p>"and the approval, adoption or making of any such plan or any alteration, repeal or replacement thereof"</p></blockquote>
and so on. Subsection (1)(	<i>d</i>) provides that, without prejudice to that, regulations may provide
	<br><blockquote><p>"for notice to be given to particular persons of the approval, adoption or alteration of any plan".</p></blockquote>
Is not that the same thing as is already provided for in general terms by subsection (1)(	<i>b</i>)? If they have objected to the plan and notified the local planning authority does the Secretary of State need statutory powers in this paragraph to make regulations requiring a payment for this kind of notice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under subsection (1)(	<i>b</i>) there is already an obligation to provide general publicity, and that is a matter which we have discussed. The reference in subsection (1)(	<i>d</i>) is to a particular extra facility which could be provided to those who specially ask for it. Those who want the privilege of this extra facility ought to pay a reasonable sum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>286</span>
I gathered previously that hon. Gentlemen opposite were not averse to a reasonable sum being paid for any extra facility of which, if it was not so provided for, the local ratepayers would have to meet the additional cost. There is no guarantee that those who ask for individual notification will have any greater interest than those who have not asked. In terms of equity we thought it reasonable to leave in subsection (1)(	<i>d</i>). and subject to the payment of a reasonable charge for receiving it. If I have successfully reconciled the two paragraphs and the hon. and learned Gentleman agrees that it is an extra facility I am sure he will realise that it is not unreasonable to leave the words in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the position is that the Minister could not provide by regulation for a reasonable charge then I would not want to press this Amendment. If people are getting a special facility they should pay for it, and the burden should not fall on the ratepayer. I wonder whether the Secretary of State does not already have the power to make this kind of regulation, but as the Minister has told us that the power is not there, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I really cannot be fobbed off much longer. When I alluded to this matter on Clause 3 I was fobbed off, and now my hon. Friend has said that we might discuss this matter at a later stage of the Bill. One again I wish to ask a simple question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we give the local authority powers, and tell it that it must do a certain thing, or take such steps as will, in its opinion, secure certain things, and supposing it then does that which it is under a legal obligation to do, and carries out all these things, and then under Clause 13 the Secretary of State has issued regulations saying what should be done, and supposing the local authority then says, "But we are given statutory authority to carry out this job in the manner which, in our opinion, secures the desired result, and we do not know what the Secretary of State has made these regulations for"—what happens then? Is the local authority in the wrong?
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0974">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>287</span>
I could understand this if Clause 3 stated
	<br><blockquote><p>"Subject to regulations issued by the Secretary of State"</p></blockquote>
but it does not say that. This Clause says at the commencement,
	<br><blockquote><p>"Without prejudice to the foregoing provisions".</p></blockquote>
In other words, without prejudice to the obligations placed upon the local authority, the Secretary of State can do this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am merely asking a simple question, which I am sure could be answered simply. Indeed, the hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) has given an answer, which I thought I understood, although I am not quite sure, and all I am asking my hon. Friend to do is to confirm that answer, or otherwise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Adam Hunter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to ask my hon. Friend another simple question, although this may be an irrelevant question. It deals with subsection (2) of this Clause, which says
	<br><blockquote><p>Regulations under this section may extend throughout Scotland or to specified areas only and may make different provisions for different cases."</p></blockquote>
In my mind this subsection raises another question, concerning a case where a local authority in the Border areas decides on a plan which encroaches over the Border. I am not aware of the areas in that part of the Border, and I wonder whether this is a rigid line. If a local authority in the Border area decides to plan, can it plan over the Border? Would it have to get the permission of the appropriate local authority on the English side of the Border? Would there have to be joint consultations and joint arrangements to carry out such a plan incorporating any part of either side of the Border?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important point. As I understand it, within the Bill as at present drafted we have no such provisions. I believe that in the English Act also there is no such provision, although I am open to correction. If we were going to make an alteration of this kind I do not think we could do it now. I accept that, prima facie, there is a need for this, because there must be some conjoint cases, rather than the responsibility of one authority or another
	<span class='label label-info column'>288</span>
on either side of the Border. I must look into this matter. There are references later in the Bill to the constitution of planning inquiry commissions, but perhaps my hon. Friend is thinking of some matter like that concerning, for example, the Solway Firth. I am to some extent inhibited by the fact that this Bill has been certified by Mr. Speaker as a Scottish Bill, and, therefore, it would not be open to us to amend it here, as I understand the position, but it might be possible at some later stage on the Floor of the House to look into this. I promise my hon. Friend that I will discuss it not only with my right hon. Friends but with the authorities of the House to see if some adaptation of this can be introduced into the Bill. If it is not possible in this Bill, there will have to be a separate Bill.

With reference to the point made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) on Clause 13, I can only assume that he has not yet received the letter that I sent to him. In his post bag he will find a very polite, considered, thoughtful letter from me suggesting that it might be reasonable to look again at the wording of Clause 3 to clear up his point about the discretion of a local authority. I would be open to the argument that, while the discretion is kept intact, it is the Secretary of State's discretion and not that of a local planning authority as the Clause stands. If my right hon. Friend believes that there are other words which make it more clear, I am willing to look at them later. However, at this stage, we cannot debate a form of words which he might find suitable but which the Committee might not or, indeed, that we might all find suitable. I hope that my right hon.

There is the closest co-operation between Dumfries County Council and Cumberland County Council, and Hadrian's Wall is no longer of any great significance. As the Minister knows, Dumfries County Council is carrying out the extension of the A47 road about a mile into Cumberland. There is a great deal of co-operation in

If a Minister does something that he has no statutory power to do, is it not always possible to proceed by action for declarator in the Court of Session and interim interdict, if necessary?

The Clause, like the corresponding Section of the 1947 Act, lays down a period of six weeks during which action can be taken in the Court of Session upon either of these grounds. If they remain unchallenged after that, their validity cannot be questioned in any subsequent legal proceedings. I am advised that it is essential to do this.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a small point. The Clause provides for enforcement notices, and reference is made to
	<br><blockquote><p>"the provisions of the development plan and to any other material considerations".</p></blockquote>
"Development plan" is a statutory term referred to in the 1947 Act, and there are certain transitional provisions in the Schedules to the Bill which carry forward the validity of the development plan referred to in the earlier legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That apart, we are now away from the expression "development plan" and are dealing with structure plans and local plans, and I wonder why we come up against an expression which will be superseded by events and which, presumably, in the near future, will be superseded in large parts of the country when the structure plan and local plan provisions come into operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a purely probing Amendment. Would it not be better to delete the word "development" from the Clause since it is a term of statutory significance in a Statute which is to be superseded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the need for a discussion on this point because it is a little complicated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If hon. Members look at the adaptation and interpretation provisions of paragraphs 1 to 8 of Schedule 8, they must agree that, reading them with Schedule 9 we see the full story.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 2 of Schedule 9 continues the 1947 Act plan in force after Part II of the Bill is operative till it is superseded by the provision of a structure plan or replaced by local plans. Having done that, the suggestions in both Amendments are unnecessary. The point has been taken already.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we were simply to strike out the word "development", the word "plan" would be left unqualified. It could be either a structure or a local plan. That is another incidental point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman would have to show that I am wrong about Schedule 9 read with Schedule 8 not picking this up. If it is agreed that I am
	<span class='label label-info column'>292</span>
right, the point has been taken and the Amendments are unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was aware that there are transitional provisions in which the expression "development plan" is carried on with statutory effect. However, what is to happen when the Bill is fully operative and the development plan is superseded by the structure plan and local plans under this legislation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here we have a provision saying that where it appears to the local planning authority that there has been a breach of planning control, the authority, if it considers it expedient, having regard to the provisions of the development plan and to any other material considerations, may serve a notice. What is to happen when there are no longer development plans to consider and when we are dealing with structure and local plans? Is there not a gap there?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This includes a reference to the development plan and thereby excludes references to the structure plan or local plans, unless it can be said that that is embodied in the general phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"and to any other material considerations".</p></blockquote>
The point is a very small one, and I put down the Amendment for guidance. Certainly I will look at Schedule 8 and 9 with greater care, and perhaps I can pick up the points from these complicated provisions.

This is a very small Amendment. The term "enforcement notice" is refererd to in the Act of 1947, but, under Clause 101, the two Acts are to be read together. Subsection (2) provides:
