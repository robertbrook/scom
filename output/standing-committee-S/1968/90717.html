	<br><blockquote><p>Class VI, Vote 2, Scottish Development Department.—[	<i>Dr. Dickson Mabon</i>.]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that in this rather over-heated and feverish atmosphere of London at present at least in our debate this morning we may find some refreshment in discussing tourism, although we ourselves may not be able to enjoy what it offers us. The only reflection I can make is that if this good weather continues it will probably do more for the tourist industry in Scotland than all the speeches in Scottish Grand Committee. One hopes that the good weather continues for Glasgow Trades Holiday starting this weekend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning I wish to discuss the tourist industry and tourism in general not only in its context as one of our major earners of foreign exchange and also the vital power it has for economic development in certain areas of Scotland, both of which things are undoubtedly true. I want also to look at it particularly in relation to the countryside as a whole. I begin by putting forward two sets of facts which I think will help us in trying to put our discussions on tourism and the countryside into proper perspective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a very sobering thought, when we look at the figures for population towards the end of this century, to realise that, at the moment, the United Kingdom has a population of about 55½ million and it is projected that by the end of the century that will go up to something over 68 million, an increase in this crowded island of 13 million. Scotland, with a population of about 5.2 million at present, is expected to have by 1988, the latest date for which official estimates have been made, a population of 5.5 million. Scotland is sharing in the growth of population, but
	<span class='label label-info column'>250</span>
what also concerns me is that when one looks at the map of Scotland one sees in particular areas very great increases in population. In the Tayside area, for example, it is projected that the population will rise by over 75,000, in Greater Glasgow it will rise by 78,000 and in Greater Edinburgh by 150,000 over present population figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second fact which we also have to remember is that against this background of rising population we are living at a time when much of our land and open spaces are being lost for development purposes. In Scotland at the moment over 5,000 acres a year are being swallowed up for development purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These two facts, the increase in population and the amount of open space being swallowed up every year for development, demonstrate two things. They demonstrate that we have to try to develop opportunities for recreation and tourism, not only for tourists who come to Scotland from outside Britain but also for our own expanding population. This is one of the most important facts to bear in mind. We must also remember that this is a population with an increasing amount of leisure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must remember that in this congested island open spaces are no longer unlimited. It is utterly essential that we should keep a balance, between urban or industrial development and the countryside; because in our open spaces and our scenic beauty there is no doubt that Scotland has a priceless asset which we must nurture and not squander. We have to make absolutely certain—here I refer to debates we have had recently in the House—that industrial development, which we all want for Scotland, is properly sited, not piecemeal or on ribbon development lines. Nowhere is this more important than in the Clyde Estuary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this context we look forward to hearing from the Minister of State that the Countryside Commission will have a very useful and positive planning function. Already, in the Report of the Scottish Development Department we have read something of the work the Commission has done in the general task of preparing and agreeing maps for Scotland designating countryside areas. I hope that its work will go beyond that general work and that the Commission will also participate in the specific work of planning, particularly where industrial and urban development
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0345">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>251</span>
is spilling over into countryside areas. The Countryside Commission must be brought in not only by local planning authorities but by all those Government bodies and other organisations concerned with development in the countryside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mention in passing a very unfortunate omission recently by the War Department in relation to extension of the ranges on the Pentland Hills just outside Edinburgh next door to a very heavily populated area. Only at a late stage was the Countryside Commission brought in. It should have been brought in at a very early stage in all planning decisions which affect population and recreation of our people in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it very difficult to judge the progress of the Commission, and I certainly reserve judgment on it, because we have not yet had the first annual report and it would not be fair to judge what it is doing without knowing more about it. We appreciate reasons for financial stringency of which the Commission is a victim, but when we look at the Estimates we see in Appendix IV that of the budget for the Countryside Commission administration expenses take up £65,000 of the estimated cost against £20,000 for its positive work of research development projects and grants and loans. There may be reasons in these early stages why such a heavy proportion of its expenditure is weighted in the direction of administration. It is important that the administration should be well founded, but I hope looking ahead that this body will be given the financial resources sufficient to do the job which Parliament has given to it and to carry out projects of a positive nature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A particular example where its work would be especially useful is in relation to the provision of caravan and camping sites. This is one part of financial help which local authorities are able to give through general local authority finances. This provision is one matter in which more positive action is needed. This is not covered in any way by the Development of Tourism Bill. That is why it is important that we should have a central body in Scotland to push this matter forward. Particular reference is made in the Annual Report of the Highland and Islands Development Board to it. The section of the Report on tourism is an outstanding piece of imaginative thinking for positive action. I recommend hon. Members to
	<span class='label label-info column'>252</span>
read that section if they have not already done so. A particular point which the Highlands and Islands Development Board makes in its Report is the vital need to provide more caravan and camping sites and at the same time to bring them up to a very much higher standard. Particularly in country areas where there is scope for developing this kind of tourist accommodation the Countryside Commission is in a unique position, among all tourist bodies in Scotland, to help in providing finance and guidance to this form of development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to some of the more general aspects of tourism. I want to speak more of the opportunities for development rather than to dwell on what has happened in the past, although, in passing, I cannot help but reflect on how much greater the opportunity for the industry would be if it did not have to bear some of the burdens the Government have imposed on it. For example—I want to deal with the constructive aspect—we must recognise the burdens which the industry has to bear in the recent increase of Selective Employment tax which puts another £700,000 on the hotel and catering industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but if this money were not taken out of the industry how much more additional accommodation could be provided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

seated position and I answered him, but we are all good-natured this morning and I will certainly give way to the hon. Member.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member, and pleased that he has the sense to give way. If he had to make a choice between the proposals put forward by his Government for a shilling bed tax and what we are doing, which would he choose?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The previous Government did not pursue that. The present Government, with utter stubbornness and blindness, continue to lay further burdens on the tourist industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see that I have succeeded in stirring matters up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We on this side of the Committee regard the selective employment tax as utterly crippling and unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. A. Woodburn</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not give way again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. There must be more quiet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The tax is riddled with anomalies. Last year there were a number of concessions in the Finance Act which had to be squeezed out of the Government by us, but there are still many anomalies. There is the anomalous position of restaurants which have no concessions whatever, but they are very important to the tourist industry. There is the anomalous position of the ski schools, and even in relation to hotels, which get refund of the tax, the lines of demarcation between areas which benefit and those which do not relate not to tourist interests but labour exchange areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Dewar), and the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. James Davidson), know well the ridiculous situation when there are two hotels catering for the tourist trade within a mile or so of one another, one of which qualifies and
	<span class='label label-info column'>254</span>
the other does not. Thus the tax puts unnecessary and unfair burdens on the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other major burden which the industry must bear is high interest rates. This is common to the rest of the economy. We welcome the incentives provided in the Development of Tourism Bill, but it should be remembered that it still leaves the person who wishes to develop his hotel to find 80 per cent. of the expenditure. With the ceiling on bank advances, quite apart from the problem of being able to service a loan at 9 per cent. or 10 per cent. to get the balance, this makes it difficult for the hotel industry to take advantage of the incentives which are offered to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we must do, if we are to make full use of the incentives which are being offered to the hotel industry, is to make certain that those in the industry are given opportunities to earn an income which enables them either to service loans or which enables them to save to provide the money out of their own resources. First, we must broaden much more widely than we are at the moment those areas of Scotland such as Aviemore which offer a wide and special range of tourist facilities. After all, through what we do in Parliament and the help we give, if we can provide means whereby more tourists will come to Scotland it will enable the hotel and tourist industry to earn more and therefore help the industry to expand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to mention two areas of Scotland where I think that there is particular scope for development and where much ground work has already been done. The first is in the Strathpeffer area, in the constituency of the hon. Member for Ross and Cromarty (Mr. Alasdair Mackenzie), where a tremendous amount of research has been done by local people with local resources on the potential of the area for winter sports. What impresses me—I have spoken to people in the area, and the hon. Member for Ross and Cromarty will bear this out—is that they believe that to develop the area properly it must be development not only for winter sports but for a wide range of activities such as sailing, which will lengthen the tourist season throughout the whole year. I am encouraged by the kind of positive thinking which is behind development of this sort, in that they regard tourism not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0347">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>255</span>
only as something which will help in a general way. They take the view that if they can get good tourist facilities in the area it will prove an attraction to industrial development and encourage people to come to live and work in the new industrial complex at Invergordon. This is one example of how we can use the development of tourism as a positive means to encourage industrial development as well. The whole theme is to let tourism lead the other development and not just follow it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second area where I think there is tremendous scope for development is in the Deeside area. Here I refer to the excellent report produced by Professor Walton and his team at Aberdeen university entitled "The Royal Grampian Country", which must be one of the most comprehensive reports on a specific area of Scotland in relation to tourism ever produced. Again, I do not intend to go into detail about the report. What it stresses, in the same way as is stressed in the Ross-shire area, is the need to provide a very wide range of activities which will lengthen the tourist season throughout the whole year. In other words, we must not only provide to potential tourists a much wider choice of area to which to go, which will automatically increase the volume of tourists coming to Scotland, but within those areas we must give those who do come a much wider choice of activity throughout the year. This in itself will help those who are working in tourism much better to take advantage of what is offered to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to widen our market for tourism with wider areas and wider activities, one of the things of which we must make absolutely certain is that there is adequate access to the tourist areas. I believe that in our road programme and what we do to develop and improve roads in various areas we can provide the biggest single boost to the development of tourism. The authors of "The Royal Grampian Country" carried out a survey in that area of Scotland which showed that 93 per cent. of the visitors came by car. This shows how important roads are in bringing people to a potential tourist area. In an area such as Deeside I am sure that the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West will agree that the roads are of good standard in relation to other areas of
	<span class='label label-info column'>256</span>
Scotland. Of those making adverse comments, 77 per cent. complained about the roads. This should be a guide to us. The more we can do to assist the development of roads in the areas the more we shall open up the areas to tourism and the more we shall help tourism in those areas. We must go beyond the improvement of existing roads. We must have a development of new roads and new routes, as has been done on the west coast of Scotland in the Glenfeshie to Geldie road.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having expressed doubtless very worthy objects, has the hon. Gentleman made any attempt at costing these propositions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I was just coming to that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I absolutely appreciate that the rate at which a programme of road development proceeds will be conditioned by the country's financial state at the time. What worries me is that the White Paper, Cmnd. 3953, "Scottish Roads in the 1970s" mentions roads for the crofting area, which is one of the most important areas in relation to tourism, only in a footnote. We must give this much greater importance than we have up to now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point I want to raise in relation to access to these areas is that we must do much more, particularly by way of travel, in the matter of package holidays. This is a point which has been raised in other debates by my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, East (Sir J. Gilmour). I find it rather worrying when I look at some of these glossy holiday brochures and see that holidaymakers are offered from London two weeks' holiday in Oban or Pitlochry for £65, whereas holidaymakers may go to Majorca or the Costa Brava for £57 for two weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must consider much more closely, particularly as regards travel, how we can produce package holidays—cut price on travel—to compete with what is offered by holidays overseas. I agree that British Railways has done a certain amount in offering concessionary fares. I welcome this. The Highlands and Islands Development Board has done this in conjunction with British Railways and also in conjunction with hotels in Highland areas. The Board is offering what it calls the "Highland holiday ticket" and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0348">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>257</span>
the "ski valley ticket" which, as well as helping to reduce the cost of holidays, are encouraging off-peak tourism. There is much more scope for providing cut price holidays and making them comparable to holidays which are offered to people in the South who go overseas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is where, in particular, I believe that British European Airways, by way of cut price air travel, which is one of the features of holidays overseas, could do a great deal in trying to bring people, not only by night flights to Edinburgh and Glasgow, but also to places like Inverness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The future for tourism in Scotland is indeed an exciting and challenging one. I hope that the new Tourist Board will face its challenge dynamically and with imagination. From what I have said this morning I hope that the Board will feel that it will get full encouragement from Members of Parliament for Scotland, and I am sure that I speak for everyone in the Committee when I say that we wish it well in the task which it faces.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Dickson Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) in his concluding remarks. As this may be the last opportunity I shall have in Grand Committee and the House before the present Scottish Tourist Board is dissolved, I should like to record the appreciation felt by my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State, the Government as a whole and myself for the support, help and understanding which have been shown by the present Board throughout the lengthy period of preparation for the Development of Tourism Bill and during its passage through Parliament. Rarely has it been my pleasure to assist in the promotion of legislation which has had such wholehearted support from a body so intimately concerned with its effects, particularly when it is practically voting itself out of existence! Great credit is due to Mr. Hardie, the Chairman of the Board, and to Mr. Nicholson, its Director, for the statesmanlike way in which they have guided the Board during this period. The work which they and their colleagues have done over the years will provide a sure foundation on which the new Board will be able to build.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of particular importance in this context are the results of the three-year research programme which the Board is now processing and which will be the first
	<span class='label label-info column'>258</span>
inheritance of the new Board. The Scottish Grand Committee will recollect from our debate on tourism last year some of the details which I then gave of the individual studies which have been carried out. This means that we will have a unique blueprint of tourism in Scotland which will afford the new, more powerful organisation with a springboard to dynamic action. Covering as they do, many of the richest potential tourist areas, these research studies provide a framework lacking in other parts of Britain. So much for tourist past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards tourist present, the emphasis at the moment is on the preparations for the new Board coming into office, and I would like to give a somewhat fuller account than I was able to do at the Report stage of the Development of Tourism Bill of the ideas we are working out on the vitally important subjects of consultative machinery for the new Board and the development of regional organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As hon. Members will be aware, I held a meeting to discuss these two subjects on 6th June with representatives of some 23 Scottish organisations, each of which has a direct and major interest in tourism. These 23 organisations are the component parts of what I referred to at the meeting as the "quadripartite partnership" which the Government see as being essential to the successful development of tourism, the four elements of the partnership being the new statutory Board working in close cooperation with local authorities, with the tourist industry and with the many public bodies, some Government agencies like the Forestry Commission and others, voluntary organisations like the National Trust for Scotland, all of whose activities are vital to tourism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Taking, first, the question of national consultative machinery, this has seemed to us to be essential because the new Tourist Board will be a small, compact, executive body, and members will not be appointed as representative of any particular tourist interest. The Board will, therefore, need a regular means of access to public opinion on tourism matters and also an effective means of communicating its views to local authorities generally and to the industry. I am glad to be able to tell hon. Members that there was complete support from all present at the meeting that such machinery was necessary. The Chairman of the Tourist Association of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0349">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>259</span>
Scotland, Mr. Kenneth Ireland, to whom I would also like to pay tribute for the great help which he has given in considering these various problems, agreed that such machinery would in part take the place of the present role of the tourist association of Scotland. The other part of the Association's function could be met through the proposals for regional and local activity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was agreed at the meeting that the exact membership and organisation of the Scottish Tourist Advisory Council, which I think we might christen the body, although I am open to suggestions, should be considered further at a meeting in the autumn. Clearly, however, the bodies represented at the June meeting will all have a part to play in the affairs of the Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the way in which regional and local tourist associations might be encouraged to develop. The functions of a regional organisation might best be described as the organisation of information services for visitors, the "servicing" of tourists by providing, for example, booking services at information centres, the development of the image of a particular area with the literature required for this purpose and the identification to the Central Board of the potential and requirements of a particular area. Local organisations should essentially be the continuance of the tradition which we have in Scotland of active and lively "resort" tourist bodies which in future might be encouraged to concentrate their efforts on the arrangement of events and activities for tourists to take part in and the provision of information about "what's on" and where to stay in the locality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Working out of our individual parts in this exercise is very important. Promotional publications would best be planned and financed at regional level, to avoid wasteful use of resources in unnecessarily competitive locally based campaigns. Local committees would be represented on the regional Associations. Much local activity would depend on voluntary work put in by people from different parts of the industry. The scale of its activities, within the agreed framework, would depend on the extent of local contributions of efforts and funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also important that there should be strong links between the various regional
	<span class='label label-info column'>260</span>
organisations and the central Board, designed in such a way as to obtain the maximum advantage from co-ordination in a national programme together with the dynamic which will spring from enthusiastic regional and local bodies which can feel that they are taking a real and effective part in the shaping of their own tourist policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was complete unanimity at the meeting on 6th June that regional associations should be formed, but at this first stage of the discussions it was not possible to find an agreed formula for their constitution. Much concern was expressed by representatives of the industry present that the associations should not be allowed to become dominated by the local authorities. I have much sympathy with that point of view, and I must add, in fairness, that the local authority Associations readily recognise the major role the industry itself should play in the running of the regional associations. They have however 	<i>faute de mieux</i> had to take the initiative in some areas—for example, the south-west—in getting something under way rather than having nothing at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad to repeat that at the meeting we finally agreed that Mr. Frank Inglis, the Secretary of the County Councils Association—who readily volunteered—should study the whole problem and draw up a draft "model" constitution which could be discussed at the next meeting in the autumn. This has been a most encouraging start and I look forward to the next meeting. I am sure that the good will manifest on all sides at the June meeting will carry us forward to the point where we can give a generally agreed blue print on these important issues to the new statutory Board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the future for tourism. The Government are directly investing in tourism because we expect a handsome return. In dividend, the nation should benefit in three ways, first, by earning more foreign currency from overseas visitors; secondly, by making our own country more attractive for our own people to take their holidays in; and, thirdly, by assisting the economy of those parts of Scotland where tourism is a principal industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The money which the Exchequer will be making available under the Bill to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0350">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>261</span>
run the new Boards and to assist hotels by way of grants and loans is not a handout to bolster an industry in difficulties. Hotels and the tourist industry are doing well, and it is wrong to pretend otherwise. This is investment by the Government and not a subsidy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, the hotel industry has its problems and it is in recognition of those problems that the Government have proposed the new Hotel Incentive Scheme and to set up Exchequer-sponsored tourist boards. We can fairly claim credit for being the first Government to give direct and substantial help to the tourist industry. For far too long, lip-service has been paid to the importance of the tourist industry but it has not gone beyond that; the Scottish Tourist Board has been left to struggle along on a shoestring with successive Governments offering every sympathy and assistance short of actual help. This Government have acted and are bringing the actual help. Of course, there may be arguments about the extent and variety of the help, but the essential principle has been agreed to by the Government. In recognising this, I am sure that the Grand Committee will wish the new Board every success in its work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome in this debate the coupling of countryside with tourism as the subject for debate because inevitably the two go very much hand in hand and, as hon. Members will agree, the Countryside (Scotland) Act, 1967, specifically exhorts the Countryside Commission for Scotland to have regard to tourist needs in its countryside planning. With the countryside, as with tourism, this Government have turned words into deeds. The effects of our Countryside Act are now beginning to be felt and I hope the first report of the Countryside Commission for Scotland will be available to the House before the summer Recess. Perhaps hon. Members will give this careful study during the Recess in order to appreciate the progress which is being made. I hope, too, that hon. Members will take the opportunity of familiarising themselves by visits with some of the work which will be itemised in the report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could not the report of the Countryside Commission have been made available in the Vote Office?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>262</span>
We cannot arrange these matters to fit in exactly with the Parliamentary timetable. I am grateful to the Opposition for having chosen this subject today, but it is not within their powers or mine to be able to fix the publication dates of annual reports of statutory bodies. I regret this present situation, but I shall make a few remarks which will enable hon. Members to learn of one or two things in the report which will be of interest to them. Perhaps next year, when we are considering our Estimates debates again, we may be able to see whether we can manage to get these things in better gear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important point. I hope that the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the Committee must recognise is that the Government cannot insist on the publication of reports by statutory bodies to fit the Parliamentary timetable. As old Parliamentarians, we all know that the timetable is extremely flexible. It is not always the case that we know precisely when a debate is to take place. We have had the Highlands and Islands Development Board Report referred to in two debates. This is an excellent report—one of the best of the three. Yet we are not debating it. I do not blame the Opposition. We spent a lot of time discussing the Board. But that report was ready. We had a debate last year but not this——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I intend visiting the Countryside Commission in Perth during the recess and hope to hear a presentation from the staff about the work it is doing and the plans it has for the future. No

The presentation which I am looking forward to hearing from the staff should be made available, I hope, to other hon. Members—probably it would be better to make a visit as a party rather than as individuals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will recall that the Countryside Act required the Secretary of State to prepare maps in consultation with local planning authorities and the Commission designating those areas which are to be treated as the countryside for the purposes of the Act. This work was completed within the time limit of one year which the Act required and it is significant that over 98 per cent. of the area of Scotland has been designated and these maps have been completed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to delay my hon. Friend but there is one aspect of this which I hope my hon. Friend will keep in mind in connection with the report of the Countryside Commission. Will he ensure that no doors are shut so as to exclude legislation emanating from the Hunter Report—I am referring to access roads to water, and this sort of thing—which must be fitted into and embodied in the Commission's work?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think we shall have to wait and see what the Government's views are on the Hunter Report, which is a complex matter about which there is a great deal of heated discussion between the different parties. I accept that the implementation of the Hunter Report or some variant of it would be of great assistance to the development not only of the countryside for our own use but also in the development of tourism. But hon. Members should not deceive themselves into the belief that the problems posed by the Hunter Report and the solutions therein are easy to understand or adopt. My hon. Friend the Member for Central
	<span class='label label-info column'>264</span>
Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel) is an angler of distinction and will be the first to recognise that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has noticed that? But I do not fish for salmon. Those are the salmon fishermen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One can readily appreciate the very wide ranging remit which the Commission has and the vital necessity of its taking stock at the beginning of its term of the many different problems which are arising in various parts of the country. One must not under-estimate the formidable nature of the task which faced the Commission when it was starting virtually from scratch and having to build up its staff and resources. The Commission was very fortunate in obtaining the services as Director of Mr. John Foster, formerly of the Peak Park Planning Board in England, who has come to it with a unique background of experience in countryside problems. Its other senior staff, too, are now in post and very high quality they are. Both individually and collectively, they constitute a team of experts whose dedication to their task augurs well for the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission very quickly realised that one of its first tasks should be to establish friendly working relations with the many bodies in Scotland which, for a very long time, have borne the burden of responsibility for countryside interests. These bodies range from Government Departments and other statutory bodies to local authorities and the many national and regional voluntary organisations which represent the major recreational, natural history and amenity interests. As the Grand Committee knows, Scotland has very many such bodies representing numerous sectional interests, and over the years they have devoted their efforts to protect what is finest of Scotland's heritage in landscape and to provide opportunity for recreation in the countryside. Because each has its own particular concern for some aspect of social or economic development, inevitably many differing views emerge on any one question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission, therefore, realises that one of the most effective ways in which it will be able to operate will be to harness these interests in a common cause and to provide a forum for the parties affected to be brought together to discuss their problems. Not all the differing uses of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0352">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>265</span>
land are mutually exclusive, and in reconciling the various interests, the Commission has a task of very real importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me turn to Scotland's interests in European Conservation Year, 1970. The problems of conservation of wild life and natural resources on this planet are as immediate to us as the more dramatic events surrounding this week's moonshot. We, in Scotland, have always been particularly aware of the problem. That is why we have been so far forward with our Countryside Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad to say that Scotland has taken an initiative in convening one of the first national meetings to be held in Western Europe for the European Conservation Year, 1970. This was in Perth in November of last year, and the Countryside Commission has undertaken to coordinate Scotland's contribution. Not only has this provided an excellent opportunity for contact with the many bodies with an interest in the Scottish countryside, but it has given the Commission an immediate task which is very relevant to its duties in the conservation education field.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The theme chosen is a basic one: how to communicate to the general public the value of the countryside. This means the development of sophisticated information and interpretation services and is aimed to show the unique value of the Scottish heritage, the way in which we need to look after it, if possible enhance it, and make the most of the opportunities there are for its appreciation and enjoyment. I welcome this theme and also the fact that the E.C.Y. Committee for Scotland has been set up under the aegis of the Countryside Commission to co-ordinate action in preparation for E.C.Y., 1970.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further step in preparation for E.C.Y., 1970, has been the Commission's decision to support the production by the National Trust for Scotland of the publication "Seeing Scotland 1969". There is much of interest in Scotland to see, and the purpose of this book is to provide the public with the sort of information to help them enjoy the countryside and appreciate why it needs a better degree of protection than it has had in the past. This provided a welcome opportunity to co-operate with the National Trust for Scotland, and also with the Scottish Tourist Board, which is able to use the publication to show visitors from
	<span class='label label-info column'>266</span>
abroad. It is intended that the Commission will itself produce a booklet and calendar of events which will be widely available, listing projects relevant to the theme of Scotland's contribution to E.C.Y., 1970.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission has also directed its attention to the need for a recognisable and accepted national classification of scenic resources as a guide for planning the conservation and use of the countryside in the future. It sees the establishment of such a pattern as essential if the unique scenic qualities of parts of Scotland are to be conserved for the enjoyment of future generations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such a pattern would range from the areas of fine landscape where established character must be the prime consideration—remote mountain country for example—through to areas of lesser landscape quality, but still notable, where recreation development to accommodate large numbers of users could be accepted. Country parks might fall into this latter category.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission recognises that this is a very complex subject involving, as well as scenic evaluation, considerations of resource zoning and management and other factors, economic and social. It regards the overall examination however as one of prime importance to the achievement of its task and has already embarked on it with its limited but nevertheless very high quality manpower resources. It will inevitably take some time to complete.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Countryside Commission is also taking the planning responsibilities laid on it in the Act very seriously. It is closely involved in the consideration of the future of the Clyde Estuary in relation to countryside interests. It submitted evidence to the Murco inquiry, and is considering the way in which it can most effectively contribute to the debate on Hunterston. The Secretary of State has also asked for its views on the Inverkip power station proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far, in this broad review of countryside activities, I have dwelt primarily on the work of the Countryside Commission. We must not forget, however, that the Act also provides a wide range of powers and duties to local authorities and local planning authorities and also enables the Secretary of State to pay grants up to 75 per cent. on approved countryside projects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0353">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>267</span>
In the last financial year my right hon. Friend approved grants on five schemes. Great oaks from small acorns grow. We are only in the first year and we have to accept that. These were small landscaping and tree planting schemes in Stirlingshire and Berwickshire, a car park in Dumfriesshire, a caravan site improvement at Castle Douglas, and a major new camping site at Barns Ness in East Lothian—and I am glad that the hon. Gentleman mentioned this as a general point—which my noble Friend the Under-Secretary declared open on 5th of this month. This was a joint undertaking by the County Council and the Camping Club of Great Britain to provide an urgently needed site for touring holidaymakers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the current financial year the Government are providing £75,000 for grants. There are many applications before us, and the Countryside Commission is advising us on their merits and priorities. I can forecast that among the approvals will be agreement to the appointment of the first country warden—or ranger as the Commission, to my surprise, prefers to call them. This will be another "first" for East Lothian.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will also be approval to a first stage programme of works at Culzean Castle. The grounds will be developed as the first country park under the Act. I pay tribute and I am sure that I am joined by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) who assisted from the Opposition side in the passing of the Bill, and by all hon. Members, to the joint initiative of Ayr County Council and Ayr and Kilmarnock Burghs in which the Secretary of State takes considerable pride, and the National Trust for Scotland which, with enthusiasm, has grasped this way of maximising the public use and enjoyment of the castle policies which would not be possible without the countryside grant assistance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dempsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend gets to Lanarkshire, may I ask who took the initiative in determining that we would have a country park?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>268</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was a joint effort by the local authorities and the National Trust. I should not like to say who was first. They were all very good. There is no 	<i>primus inter pares.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dempsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government did not take the initiative?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I might pass on from that, without the legislation and grant, my hon. Friend's point is right. This could have been done many years ago, but there was no statutory fabric, and no grant for this. It is good that we are now considering the first country park.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the example of Culzean will encourage other authorities with plans for country parks. I am thinking particularly of the Muirshiel pilot project in Renfrewshire and Strathclyde where Lanark County, Hamilton, and Motherwell are working on a joint scheme. I recognise, however, that Strathclyde is a far more difficult undertaking than Culzean or Muirshiel. Major civil engineering works will be needed to remedy the effect of a century of industrial dereliction before any park can be provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope the Grand Committee will acknowledge this morning that in both countryside and tourism Scotland is advancing at a significant pace. Higher living standards for all our people mean that leisure and recreation play a growing and more important part in every person's life. This is properly so. In the seventies we are entering a decade of change and expansion. To be successful and to develop our countryside and tourism properly we need the concerted efforts of the Countryside Commission and the new Scottish Tourist Board and, of course, us all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. At the last meeting of the Grand Committee we had 11 speeches. So far, we have spent nearly an hour on two. May I appeal once again for short speeches?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. W. H. K. Baker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to take up the point made by the Minister of State about European Conservation Year, 1970. It is interesting to note that that will coincide with the Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh, and I very much hope that the tourist bodies will try to latch on to many of the visitors from the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0354">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>269</span>
Commonwealth and elsewhere to Edinburgh and get them disseminated in Scotland as soon as may be when the Games are over.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to devote my remarks particularly to the north-east, rather naturally, and to base them largely on the Gaskin Report which has a section on tourism. But before doing so, perhaps I might ask the Minister a question based on paragraph 133 at page 34 of Command 2864, "The Scottish Economy 1965 to 70" which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Board will have before them"—</p></blockquote>
that is the current Tourist Board—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(	<i>a</i>) the results of a comprehensive market research survey, carried out by the Social Survey Division of the Central Office of Information, at the instance of the Scottish Development Department, to find what people in the United Kingdom really thought about Scotland as a holiday area, what facilities they wanted and what problems of accommodation or communication they encountered."</p></blockquote>
Perhaps the Minister can tell us the findings of those researches. The results will be of inestimable value, both to us as Members of Parliament, and to the tourist industry. As far as I am aware these figures have never been published.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In considering tourism, methods of travel must obviously play a large part, and without adequate and cheap methods of travel tourists simply will not come to Scotland. In its editorial on the day after the publication of Command 2864 in July, 1966 the 	<i>Daily Telegraph</i>, though speaking in a wider context than tourism, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Few Government policies could more rapidly promote the development of Scotland than the removal of all monopoly elements from its air services."</p></blockquote>
That I take to include the fare element of air travel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, East (Sir J. Gilmour) intends to develop the theme of package holidays. Certainly there are no facilities for these at the moment. If, as my hon. Friend the Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) said, we can get some lessening of the burden of air travel, many more people will come to our area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point relates to car sleeper services. These are extremely popular, and are very well patronised, but so far they only go as far as Perth. Nobody would disagree with the statement that the scenic beauty between Perth and the
	<span class='label label-info column'>270</span>
north-east is pleasant, but there is a long run between Perth and the North-east, and further north to the Highlands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a car sleeper service between Stirling and Inverness.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to that. I intended mentioning Aberdeen. There is no car sleeper service to Aberdeen. I am interested in the north-east, and naturally I should like to see that service extended to the Aberdeen area. A service once or twice a week would probably be sufficient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two main points emerge from that section of the Gaskin Report which is devoted to tourism. First, emphasis is laid on the shortness of the tourist season in the north-east of Scotland. That is climatic, and there is nothing very much that one can do about it. The season really embraces only two months, July and August. Attempts have been made, and are being made, and I hope will continue to be made, to extend the tourist season, and package holidays would help in this respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of the shortness of the season, the demand for labour is highly seasonal and it is said by Gaskin to be income-intensive. But from that point onwards Gaskin becomes rather depressing reading. The Report says in paragraph 1359:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The short season scarcely strengthens the case for substantial improvement in tourist facilities since these are likely to be grossly under-utilised."</p></blockquote>
That is all too true. But because it is true it should act as a challenge to the people and the local authorities of the north-east, rather than leading to depression as it has been inclined to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Tourist Board, in conjunction with the Scottish Council of Physical Recreation, has produced some excellent booklets. One of them, "Scottish Sports Holidays", lists various sports, from pony trekking to water-skiing, to gliding and mountaineering, and the areas where these facilities can be found. Regrettably, places within the north-east area scarcely receive a mention. One honourable exception is in the constituency of the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. James Davidson), because the Aboyne Gliding Club receives a brief mention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other publication which I find extremely interesting is "Scotland for Sea
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0355">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>271</span>
Angling". Many Moray Firth small ports are mentioned in the report, but almost invariably under the heading "Boats", it says that no boats are available, whereas other areas of Scotland are able to produce them. Can the Government, perhaps in conjunction with the White Fish Authority and local authorities, give a lead, if not actual financial assistance, to the local areas in the Moray Firth for the provision of boats for sea angling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Federation of Sea Anglers has produced an interesting brochure entitled "Scotland 1969: Sea Angling Festival". The fixture list gives the details of both senior and junior championships, and these are scattered around much of the coast of Scotland, from the Lothians and Dunbar to Lamlash and Ullapool.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Stonehaven?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, and Stonehaven. But again, of the Moray Firth, there is not a single mention of an area in which sea angling festivals are held. Although I have said that Gaskin is a challenge to the north-east, there are ways in which other improvements could be made, particularly in respect of sports holidays and sea angling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The increase in the number of visitors to the north-east between 1960 and 1966 is not as great as one might wish. Indeed, the Scottish Tourist Board's estimates show a minimal increase of from 653,000 to 703,000 during those years, despite the fact that 10 per cent. more new hotels were licensed in the same period. However, the figures do not tell the whole story because of the trend of what Gaskin calls touring holidays as against single-stay centre holidays.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a tremendous increase in what one might call itinerant holiday-makers, whose numbers are not measure-able: visitors who do not stay in hotels, and so on, which enable their numbers to be measured, but who utilise the caravan and camping facilities. Gaskin says in this connection:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The region offers considerable variety in its beaches, scenery, places of interest and opportunities for outside active pursuits. It"—</p></blockquote>
that is, the north-east—
	<br><blockquote><p>"should exploit these by catering for the increasingly popular mobile types of holiday".</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>272</span>
I think the Grand Committee will entirely agree with and endorse that statement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Countryside Commission, in conjunction with local authorities and local interests, could help in, for example, the establishment of motels and properly-serviced camping and caravan sites. To be entirely parochial, I would have thought that areas like Glenrinnes and Portsoy in my constituency are contrasting types of countryside which could be developed, perhaps on a small scale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Forestry Commission and private woodland owners could co-operate in opening up forest areas; for example, Speymouth Forest in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Gordon Campbell) and Blackhall Forest in Aberdeenshire, which are both extremely attractive. Potential camp sites are available, but we need parking spaces and marked walks through the forests to attract more town dwellers to these areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a point on which I differ with Gaskin. I am against the proliferation of boards. Gaskin suggests that there should be a separate tourist board for north-east Scotland. The Minister of State spoke of the conference which he attended in June. I would have thought that not only the existing local authorities but the enlarged ones which we will have when Wheatley has been implemented are ideal bodies to do what we want without the establishment of totally new boards. Of course, the Gaskin Report was framed before the Government introduced the legislation which is now going through Parliament and was, therefore, framed without being aware of the Government's intention over the Scottish Tourist Board. However, the present organisations which exist, along with the new one which the Government propose to establish—we have the British Tourist Authority, local authorities and so on—are perfectly capable of publicising the north-east without establishing yet another board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whenever S.E.T. is mentioned in Parliament hon. Gentlemen opposite get rather heated under the collar. I can only think that this is because they are suffering from a guilty conscience. In this connection, I received some time ago a letter from a constituent who has this to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The hotels in Tomintoul are all exempt from selective employment tax. I was of the impression that all catering establishments in outlandish areas
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0356">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>273</span>
were to have this refunded, but Huntly Employment Exchange tell me I do not qualify for this. My trade is seasonal and solely tourist"—</p></blockquote>
and that I can vouch for—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and, being the only snack bar between Aviemore and Braemar, I feel I contribute a necessary service. Can you, perhaps, help me obtain selective employment tax relief?"</p></blockquote>
The answer is "No" because the Government have flatly refused to do that. The point is that this constituent of mine, because she lives in an isolated area, has difficulty in obtaining assistants in her snack bar, which undoubtedly provides a service and assists tourism. Tourists who are 	<i>en passant</i> do not necessarily want in the daytime somewhat lavish meals in hotels, but may desire snacks in a snack bar, or restaurant. This lady has difficulty in retaining staff for the tourist season, unless she employs them throughout the year, which is not economic, and this difficulty will persist. It is iniquitous that hotels in the area are exempt while she is not. I urge the Minister to bear this case in mind and make representations to the Government on my consituent's behalf, remembering the service to tourism that she provides.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee is united in recognising the importance of the tourist industry to Scotland. It is fair to say that there is widespread agreement on that. This has been a not unpleasant debate so far, if only because we have escaped most of the niggling complaints and shrill generalisations which have been a feature of our tourist debates. It has also been refreshing not to have had too much talk about the tax burdens on hotels. There appears to be less of that grim determination which we have seen from hon. Gentlemen opposite to get the maximum return out of what seems to have been the modest degree of capital invested in their original speeches on S.E.T. This tax has not been attacked with the force that hon. gentlemen opposite normally manage to summon on these occasions, and this has made for an improved discussion. The grant assault has been reduced to a ritual nod.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, many hon. Gentlemen opposite still seem to retain the general idea that although the S.E.T.-R.E.P. complex is heavily weighted in favour of Scotland as a whole, the tourist industry has been uniquely victimised and its growth brutally inhibited. I cannot believe that that is
	<span class='label label-info column'>274</span>
true. In the United Kingdom terms, the number of foreign visitors coming to this country has gone up from about 3½ million in 1965 to about 4.9 million in 1968. This growth has not been hindered by the introduction of S.E.T. in that period or by its various permutations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that Scotland's contribution is about 10 per cent. of all foreign visitors coming to Britain. However, only 2 per cent. spend the whole of their time north of the Border. A surprising feature of the official estimates is that three-quarters of visitors spend at least part of their stay in London and that over half of them never get beyond London. I hope that more forceful promotion under the new tourist structure will encroach on this remarkably heavy monopoly, although it is perhaps inevitable, London being the great centre that it is, that so many of them should dally there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tourist industry of Scotland is, on the whole, doing well. I have been looking at the reports of Trust Houses for the last year and I am sure that any shareholder reading them must have been left in a euphoric state of mind. Their Scottish interests have not hindered their rapid profit climb.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Gentlemen opposite may say that these remarks are all very well from the point of view of the big boys, but the small hotel, the boarding house and similar establishment, is not doing so well. They may have some justification in saying this. However, more and more people are interested in this sort of smaller facility and there is every reason to expect such establishments to receive a larger share of Scotland's tourist trade. The important concessions on part-time workers and the over 65's should help the smaller establishments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not accept many of the complaints made by hon. Gentlemen opposite about the burdens being placed on the industry. For a start, I do not accept, talking in general terms of Scotland, that S.E.T. has made serious inroads into hotel profits. I would have thought it common ground between the parties—this was stated forcibly by the little "Neddy" for the industry—that S.E.T. has been passed on to the consumer. Leaving aside the wider argument of whether or not this is right, I do not believe that the hotel industry has sat still and been clobbered. It has made sure that, at the end of the day, the consumer has met this extra
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0357">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>275</span>
burden. One might be cynical about this—some hon. Members may call it being practical—and consider the question in terms of foreign currency. I suppose that if the foreign tourist is meeting the S.E.T. bill, this means that more foreign exchange is coming in. I agree, however, that if S.E.T. were pricing Scotland's hotels out of the home market we would have to give the matter deeper thought, but that does not seem to be happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many complex considerations to be taken into account when deciding whether to stay in the U.K. or venture abroad. For example, the non-availability of sun is surely more important in sending people to Majorca than are a few extra pence in the £. Those who represent the northeast of Scotland may tend to get this out of proportion. For example, Gaskin points out that only 3.3 per cent. of the employed population is employed in hotels and catering in the north-east. Thus, while this is an important industry in the sense that it brings in considerable sums of money—Gaskin estimates it to be £8½ million, or 6 per cent. to 7 per cent. of the total income of the north-east—as an employment factor, it is not as important as some hon. Members imagine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While it is perfectly true that Gaskin projects a rise in service employment by 1975 within a tolerance of 1,800 to plus 4,500 he says that it will be limited in the hotel industry but adds the reason that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the scope for managerial improvement and labour-saving methods is substantial".</p></blockquote>
If there is a limited expansion it is because of the scope for increased efficiency. It is a point reinforced nationally by the Neddy report. Gaskin's conclusion on S.E.T. referring to service industry as a whole, in the Report on page 119, is that "It is not sensible" to argue for local amendments in north-east terms outside the national debate on S.E.T. I accept that there should be a national debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would not the hon. Gentleman agree that there are anomalies such as I have quoted which might well be tidied up in the interests of tourism?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member jumped in 30 seconds too soon. His eagerness carried him away. I accept that there are anomalies. There is a danger that small
	<span class='label label-info column'>276</span>
hotels will drop staff early and so shorten the season. We are now waiting for the Reddaway Report which, I gather, will be published later this year. I hope it will do a lot to put this matter in perspective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>The Chairman's attention having been called to the fact that 17 Members were not present, he suspended the proceedings; and another Member having come into the Room, and 17 Members being present, the proceedings were resumed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That came at a happy natural pause in my remarks. I had better leave hon. Members opposite waiting for Reddaway, a report which, I think, will bring them less joy than they imagine at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say a few words about the incentives offered. The hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) was a little grudging about this. It is worth saying how massive the new aids for the industry are. This is a much more practical and sensible way of encouraging people to increase capacity than juggling with initial allowances and tax incentives. The Government are proposing 25 per cent. of cost or £1,250 per bed and 20 per cent. on improvements if they amount to £1,000 in one year, which must be vitally important for lifts, central heating and catering facilities. These are direct cash grants. On the loans side there is up to 40 per cent. for construction and 50 per cent. for improvements. The requirements are generous. All that is needed to qualify is 10 beds in an existing hotel and the provision of lounge facilities and breakfast and evening meals. The Government should be given an enormous amount of credit for the great effort they are making to encourage the kind of investment which we want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth remembering what the Government have done in this field. There has been talk here this morning about Aviemore. I take it as one example. It represents about £3 million worth of investment, and it is discussed as a triumph of business investment, but £2 million of that came from the public purse in one form or another. That should be recognised when people talk about the tourist industry being left in the lurch by an unsympathetic and hostile Administration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new Tourist Board should have a better, a professional, approach, and it is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0358">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>277</span>
right it should not be a loose representative body. I disagree with the hon. member for Banff (Mr. W. H. K. Baker) in his remarks about local organisations. In the context of the new framework of the Scottish Tourist Board there will be a place for the area board working on a voluntary basis. The north-east would be making a mistake in this as in other fields if it were not prepared to work together with the tourist trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point is a general one. Perhaps it is inevitable that very often our debates are a little lopsided. The emphasis is on troubles of management, but we hear very little about the problems of the consumer. I hope that we shall have a rather different approach when the new Scottish Tourist Board is set up and gets under way. There are powers under the Bill for registration and, in certain circumstances, for classification and grading. There is a certain amount of scepticism in the profession and opposition to this kind of development, but we must get a situation in which a person coming to Scotland can obtain simple basic information. It is also important that a guarantee of simple physical standards in hotels should be made available. If there were a grading system or compulsory registration we could move in this direction. There could be a place for complaints to be lodged and there would be an enormous incentive for the general raising of standards. I accept that hotels as a whole maintain good standards, but it seems that in the interests of the trade itself there should be an attempt to weed out those who let the industry down. There are still too many of them. At the moment one cannot get an absolutely authoritative collection of information as to the number of hotels and boarding-houses in Scotland. This makes matters all the more difficult for the trade itself when it comes to planning future developments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To illustrate the difficulty I point out that I went to the Library of the House of Commons to see what hotels there are in the City of Aberdeen, which is a major tourist centre. The R.A.C. managed to mention seven plus four on a supplementary list, the A.A. listed seven, the British Travel Association found 13, but Egon Ronay (by courtesy of the Gas Board) mentioned only one and Ashley Courtney's invitation "to halt awhile" was unenthusiastic and not very warm, for he listed only one. When we look
	<span class='label label-info column'>278</span>
at the Scottish Tourist Board National Register, "Where to stay in Scotland", we find there are 42 hotels in Aberdeen and 29 boarding-houses and apartments, including, rather strangely, the Y.M.C.A. and the Y.W.C.A. Even that is nothing like a comprehensive list.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The booklet goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The establishments recorded are not graded either as to amenities or prices, neither have they been inspected."</p></blockquote>
There is in fact no worthwhile guarantee for the customer. Spain, Austria, Germany, France and Southern Ireland—which is so often quoted to us by the industry and by hon. Members opposite as an example to the Government—and even, good gracious, the Isle of Man, have compulsory registration schemes. It seems to me that the sooner we get on this road, the sooner we shall be able to answer charges that we are failing to take tourism seriously as an important industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that once we go beyond compulsory registration and simple basic standards and move to grading, we get into a difficult field involving subjective judgment on standards of comfort, cuisine, and so on, but I hope that the Board will be prepared to consider this even in terms of commissioning an independent body to do this in an impartial and professional way. I cannot help feeling that we are still pathetically short of necessary information. If we look at the grading system available we find that it is often very misleading indeed. We find an excellent county hotel which has no dog kennels or necessary range of suites is excluded, while a roccoco Victorian morgue built for a now defunct railway line gets the full treatment. This whole thing needs rationalising. We must think about the poor unfortunate wondering which town and which hotel he will light on when he comes touring in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many will say that this is the Government interfering and intervening where they have no place, but if we are ploughing in money and accept that the industry needs to have the priority rightly urged by the Opposition, the Government should see that the industry puts its house in order or that someone does so for it. In terms of services and information for the customer, this would be an entirely justified development. I am glad that the Government are taking enabling powers, and I hope that the Tourist Board will push on with this work energetically.

The Board will have to remind successive Governments about the importance of the industry and the need to finance tourism development. At the same time, we must not forget that they will have to remind the industry of its duty if Scotland is to be a country in the forefront of international tourism.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to follow the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Dewar). I agreed with a great deal of what he said, with the exception of his remarks on S.E.T., to which I shall refer later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I start by making three brief welcomes. The first is to the Minister of State's speech, which I found very interesting, and a veritable cornucopiae of information. I shall study it with interest when it is in print. That is a compliment, because I seldom do that of speeches in this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also welcome this debate on tourism and the tremendous tasks which are facing the new Tourist Board in the many problems to which it has to turn attention. By the time it gets down to work it will have the research of its predecessors to help it, and that will be extremely useful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My third welcome is to the Countryside Act and the Countryside Commission which, perhaps, is the best thing for Scotland in the life of this Parliament. I am very much a supporter of the task which has been given to the Commission and I hope that it will not fail by being too shy to use its powers and failing to fulfil the responsibilities it is capable of fulfilling. I cannot prejudge this, but it has to get down to its task because a lot can happen if it uses its powers and we have not yet had an opportunity of seeing it doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to points to which the new Board should be turning its attention, when it takes over the reins, I quote from the Report of the British Travel Association. It said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"International tourism can be considered as a market rather than an industry. The tourist movement has been described as the largest single item of world trade, growing faster than trade in merchandise or commodities…. The number of Overseas visitors, particularly to Britain, has risen consistently while traffic to other countries, including the classic tourist countries, has fallen…. American visitors' spending in Britain over the 1963–68 period increased by 63.8 per cent. compared with an increase of 31.5 per cent.
	<span class='label label-info column'>280</span>
in the fifteen principal Western European countries. During this time Britain took the lead from Italy and France in the number of U.S. visitors."</p></blockquote>
It stresses the tremendous increase in tourist trade in the United Kingdom.

I will give one example. A tourist from America will, almost without exception, arrive at London Airport, though he might arrive at Prestwick. If he has not prearranged his holiday, he will decide that he will want to do Scotland, Ireland, Wales and England in a very limited time. He will thumb through the London telephone directory and see that there is an Irish tourist agency to which he can probably go and collect all the brochures and information he needs. But there is nothing under Scotland. There is a Scottish Touring Association, but I am not quite sure what function it fulfils. I very much hope that when the Scottish Tourist Board gets going it will set up a London office with masses of information which the incoming foreigner can collect and use in deciding how he is to spend his holiday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last autumn, I, and two or three others, sponsored an exhibition during British Week in Stockholm, where we exhibited some crafts and products of northern Scotland. We had several thousand visitors through in a matter of ten days. Up on the wall we had some tourist maps, plan maps, and pictorial maps of Scotland. We had countless inquiries from Swedes who had been to Scotland before, and who wanted to go back, and from others who were very interested and who wanted to visit Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before we went we had written to the Scottish Tourist Board, as it then was, and asked for brochures, pamphlets and information. We had offered, without obligation, and free of charge, to hand out stuff for the benefit of the Scottish Tourist Board, if it would give it to us. We got three miserable posters. I threw two of them away because they were not worth putting up. The third we put up along with the ones which we had bought ourselves and which were produced by a map making company in Edinburgh. I am certain that in a small way we should have been able to attract 200 or 300 tourists to Scotland if we had been able to hand out information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Board must look closely at the publicity angle. It must ensure that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0360">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>281</span>
information is available and is comprehensive and attractively produced so that people will read it and come to Scotland. I have three firm convictions about tourism in Scotland. I do not think that it is pushing loyalty too far. I think that the Scottish countryside and scenery——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>The Chairman's attention having been called to the fact that 17 Members were not present, he suspended the proceedings; and another Member having come into the Room, and 17 Members being present, the proceedings were resumed</i>.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. J. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. Brewis; I had not noticed people drifting away fast whilst I was speaking. I will take the hint and not speak for too long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was saying that I have three convictions about tourism in Scotland. The Scottish countryside and scenery, in my view, is unsurpassed. It may be unspectacular compared with that of Norway, Switzerland, or the South Island of New Zealand, all of which I have seen. Nevertheless, in life, colour and variety I think that it is unsurpassed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To press my point about not pushing local loyalty, I have living in my constituency a Dutch engineer. He was being paid an extremely high salary by a Dutch engineering firm. He visited the northeast of Scotland on a holiday some years ago and was so taken with Deeside that he decided to pack up his work long before he reached retirement age and decided to settle there. He believes that Scotland has not begun to tap the potential of the tourist trade that we could get. He is full of ideas, as perhaps many people from outside are, much more than the Scots themselves who grow up in this atmosphere and do not really appreciate it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The climate is much maligned, because people notice a certain lack of sunshine. A person seeking a holiday in the sun does not go to Scotland; he goes to Majorca or Spain, if he can afford it. People are not always looking for sunshine when they go on holiday. They are looking for rest, for peace, for beauty, and for modest evening entertainment. All these can be enjoyed in Scotland, even in the rain. I repeat that I do not think that the potential has been even tapped. There is a great opportunity facing the new Board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>282</span>
I suggest, first, that it takes up through legislation the question of late meals and drinking hours. This question must be tackled sooner or later. We cannot always blame the difficulty of getting staff in remote areas. If establishments are prepared to be really professional—many hotels are—they will pay the necessary wages and get the staff and be rewarded by getting a clientele.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that the possibilities of Scottish cooking are fully utilised. I draw the attention of hon. Members to a book by Marion McNeill on Scottish cooking. If Scottish hotels would at least offer one or two traditional Scottish dishes on their menus this would attract people to Scottish hotels out of curiosity, if for no other reason. Perhaps they will enjoy what they eat, and return. This is not to say that there are not many hotels in Scotland which already offer a high standard of cuisine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsidiary entertainment has been mentioned. I shall not go into this question in any detail. I know there are people in my constituency who would hit me over the head for what I am about to say, but I believe there is room for complexes similar to Aviemore in at least five other places in Scotland. One is on Deeside. The vested interests can lump it. I believe that there is plenty of room for a development such as that at Aviemore somewhere between Ballater and Aboyne, somewhere in that area of central Deeside. There is plenty of room for it. It would not spoil the rest of the countryside, which is the claim which is usually made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the hon. Member aware that Deeside Tourist Association, which includes some of the interests which he is criticising, is at present very active in trying to pursue this whole question of Deeside development?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am well aware of this, having met the Association on a number of occasions and discussed the subject with it. There is a divided opinion within the Deeside Tourist Association on this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest, equally, that the Borders might look at this, and the Glencoe area, and an area which I think will be an important tourist development in the future in Scotland—around Ben Wyvis. There will be a developing population around
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0361">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>283</span>
the new industrial complex at Inver-gordon. There are dry hills on the east side of Ross-shire. I have skied in some of the most superb conditions I have ever encountered in Scotland on Ben Wyvis, but it is very inaccessible. This is an area which, in the future, can well be developed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that these sorts of developments need spoil the peace and scenery. I have said before in a speech in the House that I saw Aviemore before the development took place. I am open to contradiction on this, but I think it is now a much more attractive place than it was before the development took place. I am prepared to stand by that statement in any company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How many of those who complain about destroying the peace and beauty of the countryside have done the traverse of the Cuillin Mountains? How many of them have stood on the top of the plateau in the Cairngorms? How many of them have climed An Teallach and Ben Wyvis? I am not going to say who is the person in this Room who has done all these things. I have not encountered a mass of frustrated peace-loving people trying to get to these places. These places are there if they are prepared to go and find them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will be glad to hear that I do not intend to talk much about transport, because there has already been a transport debate. I want to return to the point about the independent airlines—in particular, the position of Loganair Limited, which has had the enterprise and initiative to initiate a service between Glasgow, Aberdeen and Stavanger which should help the tourist industry, but the company is compelled in present circumstances to charge fares as if it were going via London. This matter must be looked into. The company must be given the opportunity to charge realistic fares. I understand that by working through B.E.A. it can be done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will accept that it is not in any way a Government regulation.

I want to refer in passing to the Deeside railway. This has, or had, great tourist potential. I have tried through Questions in the House to ascertain from the Secretary of State what the views of the Scottish Development Department are about the future of this railway. I am told that the advice that it is giving to the Secretary of State is confidential. I cannot understand why it should be so confidential when it concerns a railway of this nature which has been out of action for the best part of three years. The Minister of State may like to say something in his reply about this. I believe that the railway could be a tremendous tourist attraction. I would even think it worth while studying the possibility of linking the Deeside railway with the railway which goes up the central valley of Aviemore, which would provide a very attractive tourist triangle. There are all sorts of difficulties about wayleaves, and immense expenditure would be involved, but this is the sort of project we should be looking at if we want to develop Scotland as a tourist country, and not just have tourism as some sort of ancillary industry which is of no real importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A point which I hope the Minister of State will have time to touch on is the question of rights of way. I know that he has taken this up through the Countryside Act. I have written to him giving him over 20 specific examples of rights of ways which have fallen over the past few years due to the inability of the local residents to keep them up, or due to obstruction, or due to Government Departments of one sort or another taking certain action. I am not blaming any party, but the British public and visitors to Britain are losing some of the rights they should still have. Old rights of way, traditional rights of way, are being allowed to disappear and go into disuse. It is high time we took note of this before too many of them have gone.

There is the lack of variety in winter sports in Scotland, for instance, and I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0362">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>285</span>
have mentioned other facilities which could be developed and improved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But more necessary than anything else is that the Scottish people should make up their minds that tourism is already and is going to remain an important industry to them, and that they take the mental step towards displaying an attitude of genuine welcome to visitors. At present, many hoteliers and others display this attitude, but there is, in certain places and at certain times, a lack of warmth towards visitors. Those concerned in Scotland must learn to develop professionalism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to turn now to a question which concerns my constituency and the northeast intimately, but which I do not think the Government really appreciate. I have read the Gaskin Report with great interest, but I believe that it is purely an academic exercise unless one or two specific things are done. I shall not be in the House much longer—18 months at the most—and I would like to feel that one or two points I have plugged have got through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Eastern Conservancy of the Forestry Commission, skilled forestry workers are being laid off because the Commission will not make use of its powers of compulsory purchase. Thousands of acres eminently suitable for afforestation are available, yet, because the Commission will not use its powers, these men are being paid off and are being lost to forestry. What is the use of the Gaskin Report talking about bringing another 1,000 new jobs to Lower Donside if the primary industries already in the area are to be allowed to wither away?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have also plugged over and over again the fact that in agriculture the amalgamation scheme, though right in principle, is working wrongly in that it is enabling large farms to grow larger and larger and is causing small farms to disappear entirely. Unless this trend is reversed, we shall be left with a few massive farms while the middle and small range of farms disappear entirely. I have put forward suggestions for a land bank, but I will not go into that again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

What is the situation? Forestry workers have been paid off; young men brought up in the farming community and wanting a farm of their own cannot get a start; small business men are being forced to shut up shop—hundreds of them; the railway workshop employee is faced with leaving his home, and many of these people are also smallholders in the Inverurie area. The whole question of the Gaskin Report is academic if the people in the area are faced with losing their livelihood and moving away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make no apology for quoting from a letter which has reached me. I think that it must be quoted. It is from a small business man. He says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Through S.E.T., when a member of our staff gets married or leaves, we can no longer afford to replace them as the wage percentage of total sales has risen so much that every member has to sell more to keep profitability even. As the population is dropping so fast in this area it is impossible to increase productivity which in retail terms is to increase overturn. Country shops provide many unprofitable services to the community which may have to be discontinued when S.E.T. is increased. In the retail drapery trade an alteration service is provided which is subsidised from sales. Mobile shops visit all the farms and scattered communities providing a personal service. The costs of operating these have risen about 150 per cent. in the last three years. The result is that on Donside about 75 per cent. of the grocery vans have been forced off the road for economic reasons. This, in effect, further reduces the working population in our area as the drivers have to look for other employment, which is nearly always out of the area."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Brewis. Is not the hon. Gentleman's speech rather an abuse of the Committee
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0363">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>287</span>
and the subject it is discussing? What he is saying seems far removed from the subject of the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already drawn the attention of the hon. Member to this, but we are discussing the countryside as well as tourism. But I appeal to hon. Members to be as brief as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept your point, Mr. Brewis, but I am sure that you will agree that in this series of debates in the Scottish Grand Committee the Liberals have not taken up much time. In two debates we have deliberately not sought to be called. I feel justified in raising this important matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The letter goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The imposition of road testing on commercial vehicles means an increase in the running costs for the one item of an average of £1 10s. per week per vehicle."</p></blockquote>
This may sound a small matter but it is interwoven in the fabric of people's lives in the rural areas in that, if they can no longer get vans to their doors, they will move away. This is happening already in the north-east. They are moving into town and suburban areas and are leaving the villages. The letter goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"By the end of this year quite a few of the locally based lorries and general transport vehicles will come off the road. Some have been withdrawn already. All these extra taxes and credit squeezes have hit our area much harder than town areas as shops in town do not provide services to the extent that country shops do. Also, unless the farm amalgamations cease and farms in general become more profitable, so enabling the farmer to employ more staff … a community is going to fade and eventually break up. The building trade is entering a bad spell and quite a few pay-offs will be made at the trade holiday time. Farming, and particularly small farming, becomes uneconomic with the following results: Labour is cut down and houses become empty; building and improvements on the farms are slowing down with the result that there will be less work in the following trades—builders, joiners, painters, garage repairs, blacksmiths, …"</p></blockquote>
and so on. These are the people who keep the countryside going. They are the people whose industries are subject to S.E.T. The letter points out that the loss of workers with young families is going to result in further closures of small rural schools. There are half a dozen in my constituency, and they do not, of course, have big classes at this moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was for this sort of purpose that I sought to enter the House in the first
	<span class='label label-info column'>288</span>
place, and I make no apology for taking time to put these points before the Committee. Although I have taken a long time, I hope that some of the points I have made will be looked at by Ministers and would-be Ministers on both sides, because I fear that, unless something drastic is done about the fabric of life in the countryside, within the next five years or so we shall be left with a few big cities, a few suburban communities, and a few old people as a burden on the community living in villages with an ever-decreasing proportion of young people to keep the community alive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. James Davidson) is due great credit for the exhibition he arranged, but he will forgive us if some of us get a bit irritated at his launching into a long diatribe on the subject of S.E.T. while at the same time claiming that the Forestry Commission must use its powers of compulsory purchase. We might be forgiven if we wonder where the money is to come from.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is an abuse of the Committee that we should have heard only five speeches so far, in 112 minutes, so I shall restrict mine to five minutes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) made constructive suggestions. The difference between him and me is that I like to be clear where the money is to come from. For example, he made an interesting suggestion about forestry residences and how the Forestry Commission could help tourism by creating such residences. Only, I can explain where I think the money could come from. It could come from the Treasury grants which are given to private forestry owners. According to the Civil Service Union responsible for forestry, the private forestry owner gets 18s. 6d. back from the Government on every £1 he invests. That is surely the most profitable investment in Britain. Therefore, if tourist residences are to be built the money could be found out of the income tax, establishment maintenance grants, planting grants and estate duty provisions given to private owners. I ask my hon. Friend the Minister of State to investigate this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the hon. Gentleman referred, very rightly, to land held by the Government, particularly the Ministry of Defence.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0364">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>289</span>
I would like to know how precisely it comes about that ranges such as the Pentlands are created. It is something of a mystery. There should be a full investigation into Government-held land during the summer Recess. I will not pursue this as I understand the Secretary of State is writing to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, there is the question of oil pollution, on Class VI, Vote 2. Both the Forth and the Clyde have serious oil pollution problems. The pathetic figure of £10 from the Ministry of Defence has been mentioned in the Vote. My proposition is that the Operation of Military Aid to the Community project should be used to do something about oil pollution in both the Firth of Forth and the Firth of Clyde. I am glad that General Sir Derek Lang has been appointed by the Secretary of State for Defence as his adviser in these matters. This matter should be followed up urgently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, the question of night flights. The urgent matter here is the installation of automatic landing equipment for Tridents. B.E.A. has put a great deal of money already into this, and so it is relatively cheap to introduce this kind of equipment, firstly at Edinburgh and secondly at Inverness. It is a prerequisite for better facilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about Aberdeen?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes—and Aberdeen, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fifth, I shall not parade my views on the Hunter Report which are well known. The urgent matter is the question of stocking of under-developed waters and this should be paid for out of licensing. In this way poorly developed or underdeveloped or empty waters could be brought up to standard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sixth, I turn to the patronage of the arts. Here again, I am sure that many of us are worried about the B.B.C. orchestras. To pay, I think that the Government should agree to put up the licence fee, because the B.B.C. should be a patron of the arts. They should also agree to commercial advertising on the radio, particularly on the Light Programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lastly—because I am taking only five minutes—I want to congratulate my hon. Friend, in my capacity as a council member of the Fauna and Flora Preservation Society, on the fact that Scotland has
	<span class='label label-info column'>290</span>
done a much better job of European Conservation Year than England. My time is now up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir John Gilmour</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to take up what the Minister of State said about National Conservation Year and the bodies to which he paid tribute. The Nature Conservancy should also be included, It has done a great deal in developing the holiday and tourist industry. Perhaps he did not have time to mention this. I hope that the hon. Gentleman had the good fortune to be able to see the Nature Conservancy's exhibit at the Forestry Jubilee Exhibition in Edinburgh earlier this year. It was one of the outstanding exhibits. Nature conservancy can do a great deal to help the tourist trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to take up a point about developing further centres such as Aviemore and the amount of public money which went into that. We have to get straight where the public money went. It went into roads and services and so forth, with the local authorities receiving rates on the buildings which went up. The people at risk are those who built the hotels, and that is where the money is at stake. If other Aviemores are to be developed we must be certain that this one pays. This is where we come back to the never-ending circle of the S.E.T. An Industry like tourism needs people to serve its visitors and one cannot give that good service without adding to the costs. We are constantly told that we must increase the productivity, but the tourist trade is one which has to cater for visitors who often come from very far away and demand service for almost 24 hours a day. People do not arrive at set hours, but at all times. Very often it is necessary to have more than one set of staff, and the costs of S.E.T. are considerable.

I have spoken before about the package tour holiday and the possibilities that this has for development. One has only to refer to any overseas brochure to see how attractive these holidays sound. The Edwards Committee Report talks about the size of aeroplanes which will be developed within the next five, ten, or fifteen years. With the development of these larger aircraft, it will be necessary to have hotels of a size which will be able to cater for the package tour operator.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0365">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>291</span>
It was sad to read that in the other place Lord Geddes said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"One tour operator in New York told me that he had eliminated Scotland completely from any of his operations because of the difficulty of finding over-night accommodation."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>House of Lords</i>, 3rd July, 1969; Vol. 303, c. 690.]</p></blockquote>
I was slightly disturbed to hear of the proposal by tour operators to apply to the Board of Trade in respect of winter holidays. Because of international restrictions, one cannot have a package tour holiday at less than the scheduled tourist return flight cost. Apparently tour operators are to apply for winter holidays to operate at half cost. This means that if there is a return fare of £70 to the south coast of Europe for a week's holiday, in winter one would be able to get a holiday for £35. One must compare this with the cost of going to Aberdeen or Inverness. At present about 85 per cent. of the people who come to this country come through London. We must try to encourage some means whereby, if people come in through London, they go out through Prestwick. The bulk of tourists are not rich people, but ordinary citizens. They do not have enormous sums of money to spend, and these are the people for whom we must cater. If they have to spend £40 on a return fare to get to the north of Scotland, they will be discouraged from going there. At the same time, if we can encourage night flights, we shall also improve travelling facilities for business people. How is it that one can get the first plane out of Edinburgh or Glasgow? The answer is that it is the plane used for the night flight the previous evening. People in Aberdeen and Inverness do not have planes available in the same way. As a result, they do not get those opportunities for travel. Thus, the development of the tourist trade can help the business traveller as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. Mr. Brewis, I wonder whether you intend extending your usual courtesy of allowing the Committee to sit for an extra 15 minutes, not only in view of the fact that the whole of the debate has centred on the north-east of Scotland but also that the Gentlemen of the back benches are almost again outnumbered by the players on the Front Bench?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>292</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a matter for the Committee. I would be prepared to extend the Sitting if that were the Committee's wish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order. I should like to support what my hon. Friend has said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do I take it that the Committee would wish me to extend the Sitting for a few minutes, to a maximum of 15? So be it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regret having to rush under the pressure of time, and I shall make an unusually short speech for the hon. Member for the Western Isles. I do not under-estimate the value of tourism from the point of view of human need for recreation or the economic point of view, but I want to talk about the provision of facilities for its development in the areas in which tourism is developing rapidly now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We in the Western Isles do not recognise tourism as an adequate substitute for modern industrial economic development. This debate has served to emphasise how the developments in tourism have been so great that many other vital developments and potential developments in outlying places have tended to be overshadowed. Recognising, therefore, that tourism has its own important part to play and is being given this priority and this official support, as the Minister repeatedly said today, we have to make the best of it and make the most of it within the limits of its contribution in our area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To do so we must get down to the provision not only of accommodation for people coming to places like the Western Isles and the north-west Highlands but the provision of proper transport facilities to get them to and from there. In its way, this is the most important and fundamental thing of all. Unless we have adequate, fast, regular and reasonably cheap transport, we shall never fully develop tourism in that area. Or, indeed, any other industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I almost contradict myself by saying that, in spite of the transport and other difficulties, the Western Isles today, though only for a very short season, are almost overwhelmed by tourists. But I rescue myself in part from that contradiction by saying that if we are temporarily overwhelmed it is evidence of the inadequacy
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0366">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>293</span>
of the accommodation on the islands and on the general transport and car ferry services to the islands. There is in season a tremendous demand for accommodation. Familiar as I am with every corner of the Hebrides, when I want to travel there I find it difficult in the months from May to October to book into a boarding-house or hotel without giving fairly long notice. It is difficult to get on planes going to the Hebrides today, which means that the air transportation, too, is inadequate for the purpose of a developing industry of this kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1939 we had a debate in this Committee in which Tom Johnston took part. On that occasion he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We believe that the road to the Isles ought to be as much a public service as the roads are to any part of the mainland and that the inhabitants of the outer Isles ought not to be compelled to yield a profit to a private company or a semi-private company any more than the inhabitants of the mainland should be compelled to yield a profit to any company on any of the roads. A sea service for the inhabitants of the Outer Isles ought to be as much a communal service as are the road services to the inhabitants of the mainland."</p></blockquote>
It is now being said, after further long discussions by the Highlands and Islands Development Board and others, that a basis has been arrived at for the restructuring of freight and passenger charges to the Western Isles. This concept of the sea as a road is the basis on which the Highlands and Islands Board is now having discussions with the Scottish Office about the future of passenger charges to the Western Isles. It is interesting to note that this idea is not as new as the Board or anyone else thinks it is. It has been hammered for many years since Tom Johnston spoke about it. It has been pursued by myself and by many others. I welcome the official conversion to this view. I hope that this basis will be accepted, because, without it, it is impossible for the people in the Western Isles and those engaged in the tourist industry, or who will be engaged in it, to avoid being penalised by the fact that we have a sheet of water instead of a main road.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not one additional ship for the Outer Isles services has been built by MacBrayne's in the last five years. Not one ship on that service has been replaced or modernised. There has been no further improvement in the vehicle ferry services, and not one extra jetty has been built. These are serious thoughts around which my
	<span class='label label-info column'>294</span>
hon. Friend must frame his reply and which he must convey to the Secretary of State. What has happened to the long delayed Eriskay jetty, promised by Hector McNeil when Secretary of State in 1951? What has happened now to the proposed Berneray vehicle ferry? We have not had a new jetty or a ferry at Eriskay, or in Barra since then. We cannot make progress with ferries till we get considerable improvements in these facilities. I should like my hon. Friend to deal briefly with those matters when he replies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is to happen about the proposed drive-on, drive-off vehicle ferry for Stornaway? This matter has been battered across the Minch on numerous occasions during the last few years and we have had nothing firm from the Secretary of State. It has the full backing of the whole County and local people. I do not intend to sit back and see tourism or any other island development frustrated by a lack of application to this urgent problem on the part of the Secretary of State or by anybody else, whether he is on my side of the House or the other. Tourism as such will not develop any more than anything else in these Islands unless we get modernised, fast, up-to-date and reasonably cheap transport services at sea.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>The Chairman's attention having been called to the fact that 17 Members were not present, he suspended the proceedings; and another Member having come into the Room, and 17 Members being present, the proceedings were resumed</i>.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Board, through its consultant council, has expressed deep concern at the freight charges and passenger charges being increased in the Western Isles services. When will the new modern ferries come to Stornoway and the Uists and Barra? When will the ships be built and put into service? This is the best immediate contribution that could be made to tourism and the development of the countryside in our area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister of State tell me what progress is being made towards constructing the Ness-Tolsta road in Lewis, recently surveyed by the Army? This is the only important new road being asked for anywhere in the Outer Isles.

	<span class='label label-info column'>295</span>
Many hundreds of thousands of pounds have been and are being spent on a series of major roads on the mainland. We have not had one new road in the Hebrides in five years. For years I have pleaded for the reconstruction of Pentland road, in Lewis. This may be a matter for the local authority, but I think that it could be assisted by both the Highlands and Islands Board and the Countryside Commission. We need major improvement and repair to this direct access road to one of the most archaeologically interesting areas in the Isles and the west of Scotland. The hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) will know about the Callanish Stone Circles, second only to Stonehenge. It is a road which ought to be opened up from the economic, the tourist and every other point of view—as well as that of the needs of the local community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcoln MacMillan) was able to take part in the debate. It was generous of him to be so quick, as a result of which I have slightly more time than I thought at one time I should have. His was a generous gesture from the back bench to the Front Bench, and it is very much appreciated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of all the debates that we have every year in the Scottish Grand Committee the debate on tourism is the one to which I look forward most. It is a debate which I always enjoy, and one in which I feel we are able, more than in most other debates, to bring together a whole host of different interests and activities throughout the length and breadth of Scotland and try to comment on what has happened during the year, and to make suggestions for improvements in the year to come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the interest of saying as much as possible of what I want to say in the time available to me, I shall follow the example of my hon. Friend the Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith), and, if possible in a sentence, get rid of the vexed question of S.E.T. If the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Dewar) thinks that this is in the interests of converting the controversy into little more than a ritual nod, let me assure him that it is in no sense due to a desire to stop the campaign against this tax that I shall
	<span class='label label-info column'>296</span>
refer only briefly to it this morning, but simply because we are getting sick, tired, and fed up with putting unanswerable arguments against the imposition of this monstrous tax and having our arguments ignored by the Government on every occasion. Everybody knows that the tax does not have a friend in Scotland, and certainly not in the tourist industry. I believe that in this Committee we cannot spend any more time putting our arguments to the Government, who are completely deaf on this issue. It is not good enough to say that, in contrast to S.E.T., grants are being given for hotel development, because the plain fact is that the total net burden on the tourist industry in Scotland is £3,200,000, as near as we can estimate it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That compares with £1 million being given to the new Scottish Tourist Board. This shows that S.E.T. is having a greater effect on Scotland than the Government say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is no good saying, as the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel) said, that the hotels are full at this time of the summer. They are always full in these months. The problem comes at the beginning and end of the season. However, there is no point in our going on with this dreary S.E.T. argument. Suffice to say at this stage that S.E.T. is greatly resented, that it must be removed and that it will be removed when the next Conservative Government are in power and have a chance to remove it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to the more constructive and interesting topics of the debate. I wish particularly to comment on the new tourist authority and new Scottish Tourist Board. I join with the Minister in the fine tribute he paid to the work of the present Board, which is shortly to leave office. The Board has been operating on a shoe string for many years and, bearing in mind the small sum with which it has been endowed, it has done wonderful work in an enthusiastic way, often when faced with an uphill task. I wish to make it clear to the Board that, within the limits provided for it to work, it has done a very fine job indeed. I also join with the Minister in giving an enthusiastic welcome to the new Scottish Tourist Board. The arrival of a Board which is small and executive in character is strongly to be approved
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0368">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>297</span>
and I, too, feel that, given reasonably good fortune, it will do a great job in co-ordinating and developing tourism throughout Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effectiveness of the new Scottish Tourist Board will be absolutely dependent on a close and effective link with tourist associations throughout Scotland. These associations must be given the feeling that the new Board really cares for them, wants them to flourish, and is prepared to move in with them and give them every possible assistance in the work that they do. It will not be possible for the new Board to provide the necessary local information, enthusiasm, and ideas which can come only from those who are on the spot. This the local associations can do, and I am sure that the new Board will heed our remarks and remember that one of its prime responsibilities must be to nurture these local bodies and give them every support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same goes for the new developments to which the Minister referred and the regional tourist associations. I welcomed his statement to the effect that they should not become dominated by local authorities—certainly not the post-Wheatley local authorities—but that they should have links with the local authorities and work with them. I hope that it will be possible, with the limited number of regional associations now in existence, to extend their activities so that they cover the main tourist areas of Scotland to provide an essential link down to the new Board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I echo the words used by the Minister about the meeting which took place some months ago in the south-west, at Newton Stewart, when, by a joint getting together of local authorities and tourist interests, there was an encouraging response, with the result that a new regional tourist association for that area was established; and I hope that it will be extremely successful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also welcome the fact that the new Scottish Tourist Board is to have more money than its predecessor. I understand that it is scheduled to get £1 million in its first year. The first emphasis of the Board should be to encourage private facilities and so increase the amount of tourist accommodation available. The real shortage in Scotland for tourists is accommodation at the right time and in the right places. In April and May it is straightforward for anybody to obtain
	<span class='label label-info column'>298</span>
accommodation, but in the peak tourist periods it is difficult to obtain it, so that before attracting more tourists we must solve the problem of providing room for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will be aware of the strong feeling that has been expressed about the Development of Tourism Bill. I wish to have it on record that it would be sad if, as a result of the changes that are being made, the marketing of Scotland were to become more difficult than it has been in the past. Many people in Scotland would have preferred the new Scottish Tourist Board to have the right to a say in decisions which are made about the way in which Scotland is marketed abroad. Those feelings must be borne in mind, and while we are all pleased at the way in which the British Travel Association has worked in selling Britain, including Scotland, overseas, it would be more desirable if the Scottish Tourist Board could, in due course, have its own marketing and advertising campaigns abroad to sell Scotland as Scotland and not merely as a part of Britain as a whole. I make these comments in a constructive way and not out of purely national pride. This is a technical, marketing and advertising argument and there are strong reasons why the views which have been expressed in Scotland on this score should be accepted, because they could produce a better result. This would occur if we could avoid the overlapping of products, which might happen if they are advertised centrally, as in the "Come to Britain" campaign. I appreciate that the Minister cannot comment at length on this because it has been decided in the Bill that all marketing will be done by the new British Tourist Authority. I hope, however, that the Minister will study the matter. There are strong arguments why Scotland, as a product, should be sold as Scotland and not as part of the rest of Britain, and I hope that the views of the new Scottish Tourist Board on this matter will be carefully borne in mind when the time comes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>299</span>
However, this is not so much a question of finance as one of organisation and emphasis. The hon. Gentleman will find, if he studies the matter, that I am adducing a respectable marketing argument and not an emotional or nationalistic one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish, too, to place on record my admiration for the chapter on tourism in the recent Report of the Highlands and Islands Development Board. This chapter must be regarded as one of the most encouraging features of tourism for many years. Sir James Mackay, the member of the Board who is responsible for tourism, and his staff have got the right answer in the first few years of trying to develop tourism in the Highlands. Indeed, this chapter could become a model for the relationship which the new Scottish Tourist Board will have with its various associations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The success of the Highlands and Islands Development Board in the tourism sphere leads one to reflect that £851,000 was spent by the Board last year in supporting tourism in the Highland area. This has been extremely useful expenditure, which I hope will prove successful. However, it makes one wonder if the resources of the new Scottish Tourist Board will match up to that Board doing a similar job on the same scale for the rest of Scotland. Money is short for many things, but I hope that the Minister will bear this matter strongly in mind and ensure that the new Scottish Tourist Board will be able to do at least as good a job for the rest of Scotland as the Highlands and Islands Development Board is doing for the Highland area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this connection, we need a clear and better definition of the exact relationship that there will be between the Highlands and Islands Development Board in its tourist responsibilities and the new Scottish Tourist Board. I cite in support of this the last paragraph in the chapter of the Highlands and Islands Development Board's Report to which I referred, on page 48 of which it is said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There will have to be a fresh look at the responsibilities the various organisations have for tourism in Scotland. In particular the Board's relationship with the proposed new Scottish Board will have to be defined."</p></blockquote>
This is important, because the good will which exists for the Highlands and Islands Development Board, and which will exist for the new Scottish Tourist
	<span class='label label-info column'>300</span>
Board, in their links with each other, and for tourism generally, will not be enough alone. There must be a clear understanding of who does what and at what point the Highlands and Islands Development Board can step in and market the Highlands, and at what point this work will overlap, or not overlap, and what the Scottish Tourist Board will wish to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not arguing that there is anything wrong. I am sounding a warning that we must have a definition of the functions of these bodies, so that we may be clear as to how they should and should not intertwine.

Reference has been made to the Countryside Commission, and I join with hon. Members who have wished the Commission well following what I would call a most successful first year of operation. I understand that it has set itself up efficiently and confidently and is now poised to do the job for which it was established. I welcome the Minister's remarks, and I take them to mean that the Government appreciate that, to do its job efficiently, the Countryside Commission will need considerably more funds than it appears to be getting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On three or four occasions the hon. Member has asked for more money. Yet he opened his speech with an attack on S.E.T. How can hon. Members ask for millions of pounds more to do a necessary job yet start by advocating stopping S.E.T.?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear. It is sheer humbug.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Perhaps he will support me in the proposition that £3 million obtained for S.E.T. should be devoted to these things. He could ponder that in his heart and see

	<span class='label label-info column'>301</span>
if it is not a reasonable suggestion. The Countryside Commission will have a successful job to do and we wish it well in every way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I end by making suggestions about the new Scottish Tourist Board and underlining one or two things which it must do. I support the idea of the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. James Davidson) who called for more tourist centres, but it is not as simple as that. For instance the Aviemore Centre, which has been so successful, has yet to prove that it is making money in every one of its departments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that the time is now ripe to examine new schemes. The task of the Board is to look at Scotland's natural assets, many of which have not been developed as they should be. We have thousands of lochs, many of them sea lochs, which are eminently suitable for organised sailing holidays and instruction. I should like a major effort to be made by the new Board to develop this on a grand scale. We have facilities and resources throughout Scotland which are an absolute magnet to tourists, and I look to the new Board to develop them to the benefit of the whole country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am much appreciative of what has been said about the new Board. I have no doubt that one of the things it will do will be to read the proceedings of this morning. So if one or two good suggestions made by hon. Members are not acknowledged by me, I assure them that the Board will look into those matters, see what validity there is in them, and evaluate them. I shall touch on as many points as I can but we have to complete the formalities a little before a quarter past one o'clock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Overseas promotion is still being debated elsewhere and we may be discussing it next week. I take the point about this in relation to the Scottish Tourist Board. I have no worries as to how the statutory board will work with the British Tourist Authority. I am certain that the presence of the Chairman of the Board on the British Board with a completely federal structure now that there is an English Board would imply that we can come to a functional arrangement and have the best marketing success in promoting tourism in these islands. I do not accept the classic argument that we should all fragment and have separate offices overseas
	<span class='label label-info column'>302</span>
and no correlation with each other. That is not federalism, but fragmentation on inexcusable grounds. What we are groping towards is the proposition that if Scotland is to be sold as Scotland then it is for good commercial reasons to the advantage of the United Kingdom. People who come to Scotland, we like to think, would generally be willing to go to England and Wales and other parts of the Kingdom, just as we recognise in Scotland that not everyone who goes to England goes to Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that package tours are very useful and will be seen much more in the years ahead than they have been so far. However, it must be accepted that the organisers of package tours normally expect to be paid about 10 per cent. to 15 per cent. of the hotel charge for visitors they have brought. This is a commercial matter and I shall not argue about the 10 per cent. or 15 per cent. It is a reasonable point that hoteliers whose establishments are already full at the height of the season are naturally reluctant to receive tour parties, because the only effect of it is that they have to make the payment of 10 per cent. to 15 per cent., which is a big percentage payment, to the operator.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are trying to get it over to the tour operator that he should look at the question of lengthening the tourist season. What the hotelier will lose at the height of the season he may well more than regain by doing more business in the off season. It is to get a fusion of interests, which is the primary function of the Scottish Tourist Board when it begins its work in relation to package tours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The number of holidaymakers from the United Kingdom going to Scotland is running at a steady level; it is about 3 million a year. We must not underestimate that market by any means. It is not as expanding a market as the number of overseas visitors to the United Kingdom, which is rising fast, about 20 per cent. more in numbers for the first four months of this year as compared with last year. The British Travel Association estimates that about one-fifth of that number spend part of their United Kingdom visit in Scotland, which is, in terms of last year, about three-quarters of a million people. This is the challenge to Scotland—to get our share of that growing U.K. market.

	<span class='label label-info column'>303</span>
This is where I think that all the arguments about propaganda abroad for Scotland—selling Scotland's attractiveness—must be linked with the fact that people are not coming primarily to Scotland but are coming to London or to the United Kingdom. That is why I think that we must accept the facts of life as they are, and seek to get the Scottish market developed in conjunction with the attractiveness of other parts of the U.K. In this case the U.K. is greater than the sum of its parts individually. Each individual part may have a value, but taken together they are greater than the sum of all these parts. That is the argument which is put to us by those involved in the business. I hope that the executive-type Boards which we are setting up will, look into this and see whether that is a valid thesis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of fostering regional organisations, the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) knows that Clause 2(3) carries statutory provision for this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of local associations. I hope that what we are trying to do will be properly Understood. We do not want the money invested voluntarily by local associations or put in voluntarily by local authorities to disappear. It would be, perhaps, not much of a net gain for Scotland if we were simply transferring State money into the promotion and all the other money went out. We are asking those who give money to give even more money but to give it for precise purposes which do not overlap with the purposes of the central Board and which, in the case of a local association, do not overlap with the regional association.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that many people who are thinking about this will have a look at my speech on this score, if I may say this modestly, because I worked out the phrasing carefully to get it over to people that we are trying to see how we can divide functions at the same time as keeping the whole exercise a cohesive one and maximising the amount of money we already have committed to tourism through other means than those of the Treasury.

My hon. Friend the Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) will be glad to know that my meeting with the Highlands Board, which I foreshadowed in the debate on Highlands
	<span class='label label-info column'>304</span>
transport last Thursday, was very successful. We managed to discuss the four alternatives which I put to the Committee last Thursday and agreed to examine in depth, not only the proposition the Board put up but also the proposition I mentioned of capital grants to ships, which seems to be attractive at first sight to certain parties to the discussion. I will not go further on this point now, except to say that the Committee will recognise that the Scottish Transport Group, now that it has acquired since last Thursday full ownership of MacBrayne's, is in a better position to comment on a capital investment programme in ships and see if, as operator, it is attracted to one or other of the four systems of assistance which we have been discussing for some time. I have said to the Highlands Board that I do not regard this as another exercise to go on and on. I have said that we must come to a definite choice by the end of the year. The Board is sure to consult the people in its own area before coming to the Government with any agreed view. I hope that all these matters will be ventilated. Knowing the Highlands, the Government, the Board, the Transport Group and others involved, I know that it will be difficult to reach a decision, but we must come to a general consensus on this question in relation to shipping charges and I hope that we shall have it done by the turn of the year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to air and rail services. It is important that these statutory bodies and others should be considered for membership of the Advisory Council so that it will mean something. Not only will they have direct access to the Board to make representations but they will be members of the Advisory Council and will be able to hear comments, some of them critical, about themselves and will be able to answer them on the floor of the Council meeting. I hope that such meetings will take place once or twice a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want briefly to comment on the Pentland Range. The history of it ante-cedes the formation of the Countryside Commission. We have been discussing the matter with the Ministry of Defence, together with Edinburgh Corporation and Midlothian County Council, for over three years. Not all the area suggested was mooted in the first instance. I shall not argue about who is to blame, but it is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0372">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>305</span>
right to say that the Countryside Commission has a real place in this, and that we hope it will keep with us in the discussions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would have liked to touch on the subject of Ben Wyvis. I am interested in the report. It was good of Ross and Cromarty to help us and the local committee which carried out the work. The committee has not produced its final report and I hope that the Tourist Board will reach decisions on this and other matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would have liked to have dwelt on the subject of roads a little more, but in view of the time perhaps I may be excused from doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had constant references to S.E.T. I understand that the Opposition must make these references, and there have been different varieties of them. Some have been constructive. The hon. Member for Fife, East (Sir J. Gilmour) made constructive suggestions. Professor Reddaway's inquiry should not be dismissed as 	<i>de minimis</i> and it is a mistake for the Opposition to go on claiming that the S.E.T. is ruining the country. If we allocate £2.3 million of investment of this kind there is the implication that the money must be raised somewhere, either by the S.E.T. or something else. What is it to be? Is it to be from local taxation, or national taxation, or stamp taxation, or a tax on value added? The Opposition must be more responsible than that. With that one blemish, this has been a good debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
