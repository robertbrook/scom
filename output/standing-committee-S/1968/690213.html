	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Margaret Herbison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate on the Amendment was opened by a major speech by the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur). The one matter of deep interest in the Bill for the Opposition, it seems to me, is that which affects fee-paying schools in Glasgow and Edinburgh.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Herbison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was very eviden from the time the hon. Gentleman took to make his speech, which was full of exaggeration, as he knows. From the way in which he delivered it, I felt that at times he had his tongue very definitely in his cheek.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are certain statements of philo sophy to which I take strong objection. I shall deal with one of them in par ticular later. The hon. Gentleman told us that two principles were at stake: first, freedom of choice in education; and, second, the rights of education authorities to shape the pattern of education in their area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cath cart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor), who is not present, has said that the Government's proposal is shabby and spiteful Stone Age Socialism, irrelevant to the education problem. I do not think that a single hon. Gentleman opposite would say that 	<i>The Scotsman</i> caters for Stone Age Socialism; I am sure they would say the opposite. Yet the morning after the
	<span class='label label-info column'>198</span>
Second Reading debate the first leader in that newspaper, dealing with the question of fee-paying in schools, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It will affect Edinburgh and Glasgow, for other local authorities have already acquiesced in Government policy. The fact that the end of charging fees will have such a restricted impact shows how extravagant it is to assert that the pattern of Scottish education is being destroyed."</p></blockquote>
I very much agree with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is nonsense for the Opposition to lay such stress on parents' freedom of choice. 	<i>The Scotsman</i> dealt with this in that admirable editorial as follows:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As for the claim that this is an intolerable interference with parents' freedom of choice, it may be noted that the freedom is enjoyed only by a small minority or in a small area."</p></blockquote>
That is part of the case hon. Members on this side have been making.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say to the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire and his hon. Friends that if fee-paying schools are as important as they tried to make out on Second Reading and in the Committee they must be greatly blamed and indicated, because they have been sadly failing their constituents. If fee-paying schools give all that they say, these hon. Gentlemen should have been making speeches in their constituencies and throughout Scotland and using their influence to get this wonderful privilege for the children of their constituents. But they have been doing nothing of the kind. As far as I know, no attempt has been made by a single hon. Member opposite to have in his own area these fee-paying schools, which, according to them, give great advantages to the children who attend them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I believe that parents who wish to make this contribution"—</p></blockquote>
that is, to pay fees—
	<br><blockquote><p>"towards the education of their children are demonstrating a special quality of involvement in their children's education, and that, I believe, is helpful to the child, and helpful to the whole process of education itself."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 6th February, 1969; c. 137.]</p></blockquote>
I take great exception to that statement. It is an indictment of all the parents in his constituency and over 90 per cent. of parents in Scotland, or it is an indictment of himself and his party for doing nothing to ensure that parents in other constituencies take part in this involvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0559">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>199</span>
Indeed, they are denied the involvement that he thinks so important. But the hon. Gentleman's statement is complete nonsense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A constituent visited me at the weekend, the mother of four boys and a little girl. There is one pay packet coming into that household, and it is not a very big one. I have known the family for a very long time. In the autumn the eldest of the family will be going to university. I said to this mother, "I do not know how you manage as you do", because I see those boys going to church on a Sunday beautifully dressed. I know the kind of home they live in. She explained that it was all a matter of planning. She makes all the trousers of those boys from remnants which she buys cheaply. She knits everything for them, and she makes because it is cheaper than buying. Could there be a heavier involvement of any parents than that? That applies to thousands and thousands of parents whose children go to non fee-paying schools in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is because I know from my own experience the heavy involvement of my own parents in ensuring that I and my two brothers got to university that I would say to the hon. Gentleman that he is living in a world of fantasy if he thinks that the only thing that really involves parents in the education of their children is the fact that they pay small fees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Total distortion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Herbison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept that it is distortion, because I have gone right over the hon. Gentleman's speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the question of freedom of choice, and I shall look first at the fee-paying schools. I have told the Commitee before that I taught in a local authority fee-paying school in Glasgow for five years before I became a Member. Before that, I taught in a primary school in Glasgow. Allen Glen's school is the one that has the greatest number of free places of all these schools in Glasgow or Edinburgh. About 50 per cent. of the boys are scholarship boys. Almost every primary school in Glasgow puts forward boys for the scholarship examination. In my class I put forward boys whose parents wanted them to take the scholarship examination, and three were success-
	<span class='label label-info column'>200</span>
ful. But only a minority of those who took that examination wanting to be scholarship boys were successful in finding a place in Allen Glen's School.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition have made a great deal of play in saying that there are stiff entrance examinations for those whose parents want to pay fees, that the selection is by merit and merit alone. All right. Parents in Glasgow or Edinburgh wish their children to go to these schools. The children take the entrance examination. Some of them make the grade. Others do not, and they must go to one of the free secondary schools in Glasgow or Edinburgh. Therefore, whether one looks at the freedom of choice as it affects the free places in those schools or as it affects those parents willing to pay fees, there is in effect no freedom of choice for a great number of those parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Worse than that, those who feel that their children should go to those schools and find in the end that they cannot get into them are bitterly disappointed. Moreover, the children feel that they are failures. The worse thing one can do to any child at 12 years of age is to damn him or her as a failure, so that they go to the free secondary school feeling that they have failed not only themselves but their parents. I strongly object to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to take up a very serious point made by the hon. Member for Galloway (Mr. Brewis). He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If parents are being deprived of the opportunity of having their children taught according to the religion of their choice, this will be a breach of the European Human Rights Convention."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 11th February, 1969; c. 182.]</p></blockquote>
He suggested that this was going to happen in Glasgow. Of course, if it were going to happen it would be a breach not only of the European Human Rights Convention but of human rights. But he knows that that just is not the case. There is nothing in the Bill which will prevent any child from being taught according to the religion of his choice. What is happening in the hon. Gentleman's own constituency to Roman Catholic children? They are being taught according to their religion. The Labour Party and the Labour Government have always made it perfectly clear that in comprehensive education there would be, as we
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0560">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>201</span>
have today, denominational comprehensive schools. This should be made very clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cath-cart and others made great play about examinations and about our wishing to have comprehensive schools because that meant that examinations played no important part, if any. He seemed to be puzzled about this. Examinations pick out the bright children and the children with a poor intellect, but in between the bright and the poor are a great number of children whose chance in an examination might condemn them under a selective system to a school which would be totally wrong for them, and for these children comprehensive schools are the best form of education. It is because we believe that it is wrong to condemn a child at 12 years of age or, as my hon. Friend said, at 4 plus, that we think comprehensive secondary education is the best type of education one can have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to another important point made by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart, which causes considerable worry. I agree with him that there are difficulties which are not found in country areas about comprehensive schools in cities. I accept that readily, but I do not believe that because of those difficulties we should say that there should not be comprehensive education in city schools. The difficulties are there, but they are not insuperable difficulties and can be overcome by a city education authority in many ways; to give one example, by the zoning system. I have been told that Glasgow and Edinburgh will pay serious attention to this problem, and will ensure that when their schools are fully comprenhensive they will have, as far as possible, the same type of comprehensive school as in country areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. J. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the right hon. Lady has examined what has happened to the education system in many great American cities, where enormous efforts are made to achieve the results she wants to achieve by zoning. These efforts have been proved to make virtually no difference, and the better schools which are in more demand are moving out of the city centres. The right hon. Lady really should examine that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>202</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Herbison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having some of my family in the United States, I have not only examined their system but I have visited some of their schools. From what I have seen there, and from what I know can be done in cities in this country, I believe that it is possible to overcome the difficulties that at present exist. The Government have rightly decided that the pattern of secondary education in Scotland should be comprehensive——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are in danger of getting a bit wide of the Amendment. We cannot [HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."] at the moment have a full discussion on the merits or demerits of comprehensive education. If it Were allied to the charging of fees, then I would be happier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Herbison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly, Mr. Jennings. I thought this was a debate about fee paying and that the payment of fees has to be abolished because the Government believe that it is inimical to the setting up of comprehensive education in these cities. It is because of that that I and the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart have dealt so fully with this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Herbison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government have decided that the pattern of education in Scotland should be comprehensive, as it has always been in primary schools and in some secondary schools in Scotland. In Lanarkshire there are primary and secondary schools which have been comprehensive since before the turn of the century. The idea of comprehensive education is not new. It is nonsense to suggest that a great principle of the rights of education authorities is at stake. My hon. Friend the Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Mr. Maclennan), and my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) dealt fully with this, and since I know that other hon. Members wish to speak I will not detain the Committee on this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will go back to 	<i>The Scotsman.</i> I am referring to this so often because of the accusations that have been made, as if what we are trying to do were Socialist theory and Socialist bigotry only. 	<i>The Scotsman</i> says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is another thing to suggest that a handful of Edinburgh and Glasgow schools should be excluded from the common policy just because of their tradition of charging modest fees."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0561">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>203</span>
That statement has a great deal of sense in it. There have been accusations of spite and malice hurled at us by hon. Members opposite. I can assure them that, in the matter of education, I have neither malice nor spite against any parent or any child. What I want is real equality of opportunity for every child in Scotland. It is because I believe that comprehensive education will give that equality of opportunity that I have always, since long before I became a Member of Parliament almost 24 years ago, supported comprehensive education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will give my final quotation from 	<i>The Scotsman</i>:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Parents, according to Mr. Noble, want to contribute through fees to the cost of local authority schools. All cannot afford to do so, and the bulk of ratepayers and taxpayers cannot be expected to be enthusiastic about a tradition which gives some Edinburgh and Glasgow parents a chance of buying educational privileges at a bargain price."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Rubbish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Herbison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, there is a great deal of sense in that statement by 	<i>The Scotsman.</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I am opposed to the doctrinaire attitudes of hon. Members opposite, and I shall certainly vote against their Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Jennings, as I think you will agree, we have had an extremely educative debate on this group of Amendments, which is entirely as it should be. From the hon. Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) we learned that the Empire was out of date, and that on the playing fields of Eton boys no longer learn only how Caesar conquered Gaul and how to whack a cricket ball but also how to whack it on the head. From the hon. Member for Midlothian (Mr. Eadie) I gathered that the Clause was part of a splendid plot to deprive the Tory Party of its supporters. If the hon. Gentleman is relying on this to save his skin at the next election, he will be hard put to it. The hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Mr. Maclennan) told us that our Amendments wreaked of class consciousness, and we heard the same argument from the right hon. Lady. Those arguments, from the side of the Committee in opposition to the Amendment would have done credit to the class consciousness of Karl Marx
	<span class='label label-info column'>204</span>
and little Lord Fauntleroy rolled into one——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Herbison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give an example of a single word or sentence in which I spoke of class conscousness or made any class distinctions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the right hon. Lady assures me that that was not her intention, that I misunderstood the draft of her remarks, of course I accept her assurance, and I shall tomorrow read her speech with great care to see whether I was mistaken in the impression which I formed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was surprised to find the hon. Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Mackintosh) apparently among the protagonists for this Clause, at any rate on Second Reading, although he has not come forward to attack my hon. Friend's group of Amendments in Committee. I say I am surprised by the hon. Gentleman's view because I understood that he was the high priest of the cult of participation; yet, unless the Amendments are accepted, the local authority will be deprived of a very important area of participation and choice. As my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cath-cart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) pointed out in his invaluable contribution last Tuesday, this element of participation and choice is being withdrawn from local authorities, even against the desires of local authorities of Socialist persuasion, from which we can conclude only that participation is limited to the playing fields, whether of Eton or elsewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman name the local authority which has a Socialist majority and is against the Government on this matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The local authority to which my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart was specifically referring was the City of Glasgow, which until last year——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has that a Socialist majority?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may be the case at the moment, but for 33 years the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0562">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>205</span>
authority was Socialist controlled and my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart demonstrated how reluctant they were that this should happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart which brought an unexpected air of reality into our discussion. Suddenly we moved away from the glorious Socialist theorising from the opposite side of the Committee and were brought face to face with the real facts of the situation behind the discussion on this group of Amendments. I wish to refer particularly to this comment made by my hon. Friend:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The new proposals will simply mean that parents will make their choice by moving to an area where there is a nice school and where there is not a teacher shortage."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 11th February, 1969; c. 192.]</p></blockquote>
We are here touching the nub of the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I readily recognise that in my own constituency where we have had two schools on a fee-paying basis, Arbroath and Forfar, the abolition of the fee-paying places will not make an enormous and dramatic difference. I would not pretend for a moment that it would. But I am aware from what I have seen in schools in my constituency that there has been an influx of teachers to schools within travelling distance from Dundee because a lot of teachers prefer to teach in schools in the County of Angus rather than in Dundee. This has led to a degree of anxiety in the City of Dundee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the arguments advanced by hon. Members opposite against fee-paying schools is that such schools tend to enjoy a higher teacher-pupil ratio and therefore that they fly against the principle of equality in education. I would not entirely disagree with that, but I question whether by abolishing the fee-paying places in big city schools we shall rectify the situation. If fee-paying places in schools in a city like Dundee are abolished many teachers in those schools may choose to move to schools—comprehensive schools certainly, not fee-paying schools—outside the city in the surrounding country area. That is a possibility. That is another way of describing what my hon. Friend the Member for Cathcart referred to. Either the parents will move to areas where
	<span class='label label-info column'>206</span>
school provision appears to be more attractive or the teachers will move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman maintain that the retention of fee-paying schools will cure the problem of teacher shortage?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course not. I do not think that that interpretation could possibly be put on my remarks. What I am saying is that the abolition of fee-paying places is likely to increase the problem of teacher distribution. The retention of fee-paying schools will not solve the teacher shortage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we are seeing is another typical instance of the fruitless search for the Socialist tenement in which we are locked in a fortress and the keys are taken away so that all freedom of choice is removed. Thank heaven, things do not work out in that way. If we deprive people of freedom of choice in one direction, they will find it in another. That is what will happen in this instance, as has happened in many other instances in which the Government have tried, bit by bit, to erode and interfere with individual freedom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to perhaps the most fundamental objection to the proposal in this Clause. It is said in the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum to the Bill that the implementation of this Clause will cost the ratepayer and taxpayer £250,000. That was the figure given by the Secretary of State on Second Reading. My hon. Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) pointed out, quite rightly, that it is probably a significant underestimate, but no one would pretend that, whether the sum be £250,000 or even £350,000, it is a vast sum to spend on education. But when is it to start falling due. It is to start falling due in 1970. Perhaps hon. Members opposite believe that one of the Prime Minister's recurrent miracles will have occurred by then.

This is not the time when we should be contemplating depriving our education system of an additional source of private finance, albeit very small, which could contribute to the standards and amenities of education at a time when, because of the economic stringencies, those amenities and standards will be most rigorously circumscribed. That is my argument, and I submit that it is (highly relevant to the consideration of this Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are we finished with that one?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Far from eliminating an element of private finance from our education system, we should be seeking every day to attract more private finance into this part, as into other parts, of our social services. If we rely exclusively on the ratepayer and taxpayer, as the Government propose to do in this instance, we shall lag further and further behind the levels and standards which those social services should attain and which we want them to attain. To cut a source of external finance, however small, at this moment is sheer, stark, raving lunacy.

I appeal to the Under-Secretary of State to think again. The Labour Party has already sacrificed a whole herd of sacred cows on the altar of economic expediency. Surely one more would hardly be an intolerable imposition. If hon. Members opposite can accept a 2s. 6d. prescription fee, surely they need not strain at a £250,000 private contribution to State education. All that we are asking the hon. Gentleman to sacrifice is, not a vast, great, fat, sacred cow, but a modest little calf. If he is not prepared to make that piece of ritual slaughter, I shall be delighted to join my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Small</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Bruce-Gardyne) has taken us into the realms of international finance. He has referred at length to what has been said by his hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor). However, the entertaining feature of this debate was the speech of the hon. Member
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0564">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>209</span>
for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur), because he clearly illustrated the nature of the animal in terms of Tory Party philosophy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cathcart gets headlines in the 	<i>Glasgow Herald</i> with his talk of Stone Age Socialism. But the hon. Gentleman is a Tory deviationist. He is in a different situation from that of his hon. Friends. His hon. Friends believe in ancestor worship. If one were allowed to speak in French in this Committee, one would refer to him as Citoyen Cathcart. The question of fee-paying does not arise in his constituency. The hon. Gentleman said on Tuesday:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Let us forget the hypocritical statements about fees. They are not the issue."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 11th February, 1969; c. 191.]</p></blockquote>
But that is what this Amendment is about: it is about the abolition of fees. This is impeccable logic. There is a contractual element in the payment of fees. If one pays fees, one gets something more. One is paying for a differential, and that differential—and it is difficult to describe it without being too vulgar—encourages a form of educational gluttony. There is a cost of about £250 to £300 per pupil place. But in this instance one enters into a contract and pays £7 10s., £10 or £40. One gets more and more at a cut-price rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for South Angus talked about international finance. Let us take the history of our competitors. The hon. Gentleman should read the philosophy of people like Madame Krupskaya, who went to fee-paying schools. It is obvious that in areas where education is provided by the State and is not free, it is still good. This means that the differential which exists in this country should not exist. Merely because education is free does not mean that it is not good. It is time, therefore, that we got rid of the intellectual oasis that surrounds this business and considered the matter in hard terms. Hon. Gentlemen opposite are constantly setting up Aunt Sally when we debate education, and it is time that they got down to the hard facts.

My hon. Friends and I are not, in matters of education or anything else, dyed in the wool diehard Socialists. We wish to take into account the require-

	<br><blockquote><p>"The traditional pruning process at all levels produced an intellectual elité, but it also eliminated many candidates who would have done well if given the opportunity."</p></blockquote>
We are eliminating this obstacle. It is a fallacy to say that simply because one can afford to pay, one can get something better in return. Whatever happens in this sphere, the local corporation must continue to supply education.

We are dealing with corporation schools, so ownership is not in dispute. It is no good hon. Gentlemen opposite speaking about traditions dating back 800 years or more and saying, "They belong to us."

My part of the country is not affected by the debate, but being interested in education, and having listened attentively to all that has been said, I have tried to put myself in the position of an impartial observer
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0565">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>211</span>
in an effort to decide how I will record my vote, since the debate on this Amendment must be coming to an end. [HON. MEMBERS: "Oh, no."] To say, as the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) said, that by taking this step we are trampling on the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights is to overstate the case. We should not confuse the two issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened with great interest to the speech of the right hon. Lady for Lanarkshire, North (Miss Herbison) who always speaks with great authority on these matters, being both a teacher and a politician. She made out a powerful case against the official Opposition line in this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire pointed out that in Edinburgh there were 380 applicants for 70 places at a fee-paying school. This means that 70 parents were satisfied while the rest were disappointed. I fail to see how freedom of choice can work equitably in such a situation. There must have been a great deal of heart searching among the parents of the children who failed, which is not to say that those children did not go on to receive a good education. Anyone who has had anything to do with education appreciates how parents get worked up over these matters, particularly if one set of parents is notified that their child has been accepted, while another set, perhaps living next door, are told that their child failed to make the grade. Nothing can cause more bitter feeling between neighbours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that teachers have an incentive to apply for posts at schools which are known to have creamed off the best pupils from comprehensive schools. This also causes anomalies in the general pattern of education. Privileged schools should not be allowed to draw teachers away from the general education system in this way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The success achieved by pupils of fee-paying schools has been mentioned and I accept that it must be true. However, there is no reason to think that those pupils would not have achieved the same success had they attended comprehensive schools. The present system tends to put bright pupils at an advantage compared with the less bright ones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>212</span>
Being personally interested in education, I would like to see every pupil having the same opportunities, and I am happy that we are living in an age when gradually they are being provided. Only thirty or so years ago, academic pupils received every attention while pupils interested in the mechanical side of life got little support. I have been amazed in my constituency to find that pupils who were slow to make progress in academic subjects have made places for themselves in the world, are working in garages and elsewhere, and enjoying good employment. Indeed, I know of some youngsters who were not bright academically but who today can take a tractor or motor car apart and put it together again in no time. As far as I am aware, the principles which the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire has been advocating in the Committee have not been advocated by him in his part of the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacKenzie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government are there to govern. [HON.

The same was true when the Conservatives were in power. There comes a time when the Government must take a firm stand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to delay the Committee further. Suffice to say that, to my mind, the fee-paying system is quite out of date, and I cannot support it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been an entertaining and, in many ways, educative debate. I have listened with great interest to what has been said, and particularly to the charge made by hon. Gentlemen opposite that my hon. Friends are class conscious. I am sure that, on reflection, hon. Gentlemen opposite will reject that charge. Instead, we should realise the parent-conscious principle with which we are concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0566">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>213</span>
I have for long been associated with education and have often seen what I would call parent-consciousness at work. Sometimes it operates in the most remarkable ways. I recall flying home from the Far East on one occasion in an aircraft full of Scots and English boys and girls, most of them returning from their homes in the Far East to continue their education in this country. They were probably going to fee-paying schools. That was an example of parent-consciousness. Some of these parents are servants of the House. A civil servant has little control over the area in which he works. Often he can be seconded from home duties to the ends of the earth. I have met these people, talked with them and one of their great problems is the education of their children. They do not want them to leave home. They feel that the influence of the parents is a wonderful instrument in shaping the career of the child and its way of living. They sometimes felt that their own advancement was hindering the education of their children. I have seen it not only at that level but in the humblest homes of Glasgow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
For a long period of my life, ten years or more, I engaged in private tutoring. I tutored boys and girls in Glasgow who came from abroad to enter some of the top level schools in Edinburgh, such as Fettes, St. Andrew's Ladies' College; and also the school where my right hon. Friend the Member for Lanarkshire, North (Miss Herbison) taught with so much distinction, Allen Glen's School. I have had fathers and mothers coming to me, asking me to take their children in hand, and get them through their examinations. They presented me with a problem in that they could not always meet my fee. That is a serious problem. They had no help, and in those cases I had to do something which I did not like doing, because it is a bad practice. I had to accommodate my charge to their circumstances. This experience makes me aware of how important parent-consciousness is—the desire of the parents to give their child the best possible start in life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must remember, however, that today there are children who have passed through Glasgow schools and who are now making more money than Members of Parliament. I know. I have met some
	<span class='label label-info column'>214</span>
of them. They are doing this by the use of their feet; a part of the body which is often not sufficiently educated at school. Other children find their own methods of expressing themselves and making their contribution to life. Cost should never enter into the argument about education. A boy is a whole person. That should be the major factor in our thinking. It may be said that this will relieve people of their obligations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At this moment into this Room is coming one of the greatest of gifts—sunlight. We are all enjoying it just now, but not one of us is paying for it. No one would dream of bottling it and selling it—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] Hon. Gentlemen are completely out of touch with the civilisation in which they are living. If they were interested they could bring that sunlight into the evening school. They have evidently never heard of Glasgow Corporation having provided in so many parts of the city that type of sunlight which can be provided even at night, though the source may not be the same at night. At the moment we are breathing air. Why? That might be a question that I could pose to some hon. Members opposite. Again there is no charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The best things in life are free, and one of them is education, but education cannot be free. It may be free for the individual but the State has to meet the cost. The Welfare State must assume the obligations which at least one of the troglodytes on the other side of the Committee would still leave with the individual. I am certain that fair-minded and proper-thinking Members opposite do not subscribe to the views expressed by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cath-cart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we reach this point we have to look round and seek guidance about how this will work. We can have such guidance because we are in a city which has already taken this step which the Government want us now to take in Scotland. Fees were abolished in England and in all the London local authority schools in 1944. How does this work? I am very closely in touch with one of those schools. I trust that I shall be forgiven for saying this, but my wife is the deputy head at one of these schools. That school, Raine's Secondary School,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0567">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>215</span>
was a fee-paying school. She assures me, though she was not there in 1944, that every record and every bit of information shows that the school has not gone back one step since fees were abolished. There are other schools in London which tell the same story, such as Haberdashers. I am told that it has even improved. There is also the City of London School, a secondary school. It, too, is among this group of schools which abandoned fee paying many years ago. Not one has declined in any educational, social or scholastic sense, or indeed in athletics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must look for outside guidance and try to get rid of this narrow-mindedness, or should I say Scots canniness about making a change. We will then be encouraged to go ahead. Not only is this proposed step in keeping with what has happened in England, it is in line with events in the wider world. There is almost a whole continent today where education is free and where the school-leaving age is much higher than here. We must look outside for encouragement, to see this sort of parent consciousness, to see what parents will do, and we must make sure that, like the rest of the best things in life, education, too, is free. My view, which I have held strongly for years, as the result not merely of my thinking but of my experience, is that this is one of the best steps the Government have ever taken and I am sure that the Committee will agree with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Clark Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that as I was not feeling too well on Tuesday I missed the speeches of hon. Members but I have, of course, got HANSARD. I heard the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) at the Sitting before, and it was one of the best speeches I have ever heard in the Scottish Committee, and I agree with almost every word of it. There is no point in repetition. So I would advance three arguments fairly shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Scotland education is primarily a matter for the local authorities. It is probably right that it should be so, because education is a matter which should be close to the public; it is very much a personal, family matter. If local
	<span class='label label-info column'>216</span>
authorities wish to charge fees in certain schools, and they have had this right for many years, why should they not be allowed to continue to do so provided there is clear support from the parents in those areas? Most Members believe that people should feel that they have some part in government, and that their ideas and wishes are heeded by authority. I recognise that central direction is required in certain fields, but it should be restricted to the minimum. The Clause proposes further direction and restriction. It restricts manoeuvre and choice, and that is contrary to what we are all trying to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the citizens of Edinburgh and Glasgow or elsewhere wish to bring pressure on their local authorities, they can do so. They have not done so on the question of abolishing fee-paying schools, and the Government seem to be acting somewhat dictatorially. I wonder whether St. Andrew's House really knows best, and what evidence it has that in introducing the Bill it is meeting the wishes of the people of Edinburgh and Glasgow. What evidence has the Minister that he is meeting the wishes of my constituents and those of other hon. Members?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People do not realise that this move to abolish fee-paying in corporation schools is leading to something else. It is only a preliminary skirmish leading to an attack on the grant-aided schools. I must warn everybody in Scotland of this, and I trust that they will take heed. It is a much bigger issue than the matter of the 27 schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government do not really understand the eventual effects of their policy. Comprehensive education may be suitable in many places. I am not blindly against it. It has subsisted in many parts of Scotland and elsewhere. Indeed, my old school, Eton, is comprehensive in many ways, except that it does not take girls. Once there we were graded—in fact, selected—for certain forms. The basic form, or division as we called it, was then dealing with classics, English and history. Normally the boys in that form moved up the school roughly together. But for other subjects, such as science, maths or French, one could be in a higher or lower form according to one's abilities. I will not hide from the Committee that as regards maths I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0568">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>217</span>
was in the lowest possible form, and practically bottom of that. But I shared that distinction with a boy who became a successful stockbroker. I do not know whether there is a moral in that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am against comprehensive education for not purely theoretical reasons. If fee-paying is abolished in Edinburgh and fee-paying schools are incorporated into an entirely comprehensive system, there will be a tremendous upheaval and a good deal of expense involved. The reason is largely one of geography. The Royal High School, for example, will have to be converted to take girls. Because of the location of the schools in Edinburgh, the west side of the city would have far too many while the south and the east would have too few. The difficulty is overcome at present because many south side children go to fee-paying schools in other parts of the city.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Has the Minister made calculations about this? Can he tell me what the costs are to be? What has Edinburgh Corporation said on the matter? The abolition of fees will cost the taxpayer and ratepayer another £250,000. I believe that in Edinburgh the figure is £155,000, or 2d. on the rates. We must not forget that in Edinburgh the rate support grant formula is to be changed, and that will add another 9d. to the rates. At a time of economic difficulty, why on earth place more rate and tax burdens on the public, particularly for something they do not want?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a general policy, it is common sense and practical to leave schools which have long traditions and which turn out good pupils alone. The fee-paying schools in Edinburgh could be filled three times over. It is a wise policy to let them get on with their job. All our resources should rather be concentrated on those schools which need improvement, whether because of faulty structure, lack of playing fields or staff difficulties. Let us pull up, not destroy. Nearly all moderate men and women would approve of that policy. I believe that the right hon. Member for Lanarkshire, North (Miss Herbison), whom I always regard as my political sweetheart on the Government benches, would support that line of reasoning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend the statement of my right hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble), who said that if the Clause goes
	<span class='label label-info column'>218</span>
through we shall, when elected, reverse the position and restore freedom of action to the local authorities. That was reinforced, and the undertaking again given, by my right hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could hardly think that I could be accused of intervening too early in the debate.

I would have thought that they might welcome an opportunity of hearing me say something about it now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal first with the point the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) has just made, and which has been made by a number of other hon. Members, about the relationship between central and local Government on a matter of this sort, and whether it is right and proper that on such a matter the Government should take any decision at all. I believe that certain important principles are involved in this decision, and it is right that Government should be allowed to take decisions on these matters. I very much agree with the hon. Member for Ross and Cromarty (Mr. Alasdair Mackenzie) on this. We are doing exactly the same as was done by a Conservative Government, that of Winston Churchill, and by
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0569">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>219</span>
a Conservative Minister of Education, Mr. R. A. Butler, as he then was, in 1944 in the case of England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is rather offensive, in a way, to teacher opinion in Scotland to suggest that we are doing something which strikes at the fabric of Scottish education when we all know, not least the hon. Member for Galloway (Mr. Brewis), who made this point, that the principal teachers' organisation in Scotland, the E.I.S., fully supports the abolition of fee-paying in local authority schools in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of financial arrangements, I can tell the Committee that when my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State met the local authorities on 24th January to speak to them about the forthcoming rate support grant order he told them that there would be an appropriate adjustment in the grant for 1970–71 to take account of the abolition of fees in local authority schools in that year. This matter can be debated when the order is debated in the House, but the financial adjustment has been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been clear, sometimes not so much because of what was said explicitly, but certainly by considerable implication, that when we are talking about this Amendment and the abolition of fee-paying we are also raising the whole question of selection at the age of 12 for secondary education. Perhaps I might repeat what I said on an earlier Amendment about what I feel about selection generally. I believe that selection at the age of 12 is wrong for a number of reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, it distorts the primary school curriculum, the primary school organisation, by channelling it into an attempt to select a comparatively small number of pupils at the age of 12 for a particular kind of education. The liberalisation of the primary school curriculum which comes from the abolition of selection has to be seen at the primary school level, and it is a very heartening thing to see what happens when the process of selection goes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Second, selection cannot be really accurate at the age of 12 or, for that matter, at any age.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Third, and related to this, the selection process is based on the myth of a
	<span class='label label-info column'>220</span>
kind of general ability which can be measured in particular individuals. But each individual has particular aptitudes and abilities in particular directions, and there is no such thing as general ability in the absolute sense. Nor is it true that one can divide pupils into those with a theoretical or academic turn of mind on the one hand, and those with a practical, non-academic turn of mind on the other. We are all mixtures of aptitudes and abilities, and therefore the selection process, so far as it is based on the theoretical and practical division, is bound to be inaccurate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point which I mentioned earlier is that the selection process was largely irreversible, and therefore developing aptitudes and abilities were not fitted into the system. The decision once having been made, it was virtually irreversible except in the most exceptional circumstances. Because of this, a large number of pupils are misplaced and are getting the wrong kind of education, an education which does not fit their abilities and aptitudes. This leads, inevitably, to a considerable waste of talent, which is documented so extensively in the Robbins and Crowther Reports, and in many other pieces of research, that it is hardly necessary for me to make the point, except to refer hon. Gentlemen who are interested to those documents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we ought to be attempting, and what we are attempting as a Government, is to ensure that the pattern of Scottish education does not make this division, and that it is a system which caters, so far as any system possibly can, for individual talents, a system which leaves the option open to individual pupils, so long as these options can be left open, and a system which gives the utmost flexibility, so that as aptitudes develop and manifest themselves it is possible to fit the education to the child rather than to fit the child to a preconceived system of education. It is for reasons such as these that I support the abolition of selection and the introduction and extension of the comprehensive system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If selection at the age of 12 is wrong, then selection at an earlier age is more wrong, and if there has to be selection
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0570">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>221</span>
—and one wants to avoid it wherever possible—then the later the age at which the selection is made the better it is for the system as a whole and for the individual pupils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make these points because, although we have had a lengthy debate about fee paying and selection, I am still not clear what the Opposition feel about the selective system. Most hon. Gentlemen opposite, at least as part of their thinking, recognise the defects of selection. They recognise the unpopularity of selection from the parental point of view, and there must be very few hon. Gentlemen opposite who would make a wholehearted speech in favour of selection to any typical meeting of parents in their constituencies, because they recognise its tremendous unpopularity amongst parents. Nevertheless, that they are fundamentally divided in their minds about this, and that is shown by their speeches on the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading several hon. Gentlemen used a term, which I though was never used explicitly these days, that education ought to be concerned with the production of an élite. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith) made that point, and one or two hon. Gentlemen have been using the term "élite" again in the debate on the Amendment. The notion, which still lingers in the minds of hon. Gentlemen opposite, that the primary aim of education should be the production of a small number of people of high ability, an élite, is completely out of date, not only educationally but economically, socially, and in every other way. It does not meet the needs of 1969.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This division in the minds of hon. Gentlemen opposite comes out in other arguments; for example, in the argument that the comprehensive system is all right in some areas but not all right in others, which means that selection is all right in certain areas but not all right in others. If selection suffers from the defects which I have described, it is a remarkable argument that there should be some geographical areas of Scotland where it should, nevertheless, be the right system and other geographical areas where it should be the wrong system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point is that in those areas to which the hon. Gentle-
	<span class='label label-info column'>222</span>
man is referring the local authority responsible for education wishes that system to continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a different argument. [HON. MEMBERS: "No."] I have already dealt with the argument about local authorities and central Government; I am now dealing with the merits of the case for selection. If selection suffers from the defects which I have described, it is a remarkable proposition that, nevertheless, it should be the right system for some areas but not for other areas. This argument is used to cover up a fundamental division and muddle-mindedness on the part of Opposition hon. Members. The Amendment is a prime example of the muddle-headedness of the Opposition. It is remarkable, for reasons which I shall describe, to tie the argument about selection to, above all things, the payment of fees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us ask ourselves why parents pay fees. I respect many of the parents who take this decision. I am not being critical of them and I understand their feelings. One understands that in virtually every case they are motivated primarily by what is for the good of their children. I do not pretend it is in any way otherwise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parents do not pay fees just for the sake of paying fees, or because they want to make an additional contribution to local revenues. They do not act in this way in other directions and I do not imagine that many of them are motivated by that kind of altruism in the payment of school fees. Nor do they pay fees, as the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) argued, simply to demonstrate their interest in the education of their children. If these parents did not pay fees. I believe that they would still demonstrate the same interest in the education of their children. If these people lived in areas of Scotland where there were no fee-paying schools, there would be no lessening of their interest and concern for the education of their children and, one hopes, the education of other children in the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The simple answer about the payment of fees is the obvious one that parents pay fees for the education of their children because they think that their children will get a better education. We know
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0571">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>223</span>
from our personal experience that this is the basic reason why parents pay fees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must ask ourselves whether, in principle, it is right that within the State system—I leave aside the independent sector of education where different arguments, which can be developed on another occasion may well apply—a small number of parents should be allowed to pay fees for a better kind of education for their children. I am speaking now of the principle; I shall come to cases in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said on Second Reading, better implies worse. There cannot be a better system and a better provision unless there is an inferior system and an inferior provision within the State system. If this were the argument, it could only be wrong in principle that parents should be allowed to buy a better kind of education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition are not even clear on this. They recognise the weakness of the "buying better" argument. Some of their arguments have been put forward to demonstrate that it is not better, that the teacher-pupil ratio is not different and that the system is basically the same. If it is not any better or any different, then the whole argument is completely pointless. One does not see what is the basis of the argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: According to the Government, there is privilege available to parents who pay the fees, but if the hon. Gentleman is now saying that fee-paying schools are not better, then surely the question of privilege does not arise, and the whole of his argument collapses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not come to the main point of my argument on this. I am simply demonstrating the falsity of the argument of the Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A respectable argument would be that parents should be allowed to pay fees because they are buying not a better or worse kind of education but a different kind of education within the State system. What is the different kind of system and the different kind of education for which parents are paying fees within the State system? It is nothing terribly special, it has no unique characteristic. At the secondary level parents are paying fees for a traditional senior secondary educa-
	<span class='label label-info column'>224</span>
tion. With all respect, there is no difference between the Glasgow High School on the one hand and any other longstanding senior secondary school in Scotland on the other. One school may be better than another in certain respects but basically they are providing the same kind of education. There are not large numbers of parents in Scotland clamouring to pay fees for their children to attend junior secondary schools. They are paying fees because they want their children to attend senior secondary schools. In the development of the comprehensive system there are senior secondary schools all over Scotland many of them with reputations equal to those of the schools we are talking about today which are being transformed and converted into comprehensive schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be merit in the argument that we should not replace senior secondary schools but retain the system of senior secondary schools, and that argument should be seriously answered. There is no merit in the argument that it is all right for senior secondary schools generally in Scotland to be replaced by comprehensives, but it is all wrong—this is what the Opposition are saying—for senior secondary schools at which there is fee-paying to be replaced by comprehensive schools. Whatever the merits of the argument may be, they cannot adhere to the characteristic of the schools that fees are paid. The argument has to be on an entirely different basis. I do not believe that the Opposition have cleared up this uncertainty, lack of clarity and muddle in their argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman agree that there is a difference, in that the senior secondary schools in most areas are territorial senior secondary schools, whereas the schools we are discussing are essentially non-territorial schools, and there is a world of difference between the two?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to this point in a moment. The hon. Gentleman made the best speech from the Opposition side on this matter. He perhaps did not have a tremendous amount of competition, but I thought that the hon. Gentleman was less muddled than most of his hon. Friends, and I will take up some of his points a little later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0572">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>225</span>
A less respectable argument than the one which I have just given for the payment of fees would be that they give some social status which is not given at ordinary local authority schools, even senior secondary schools. This is a disreputable reason for maintaining local authority fee-paying schools in Scotland. Yet we all know that this is a factor of considerable importance in Edinburgh and to a lesser extent in Glasgow. Again, I am not arguing in terms critical of the parents, but no one can live in Edinburgh for even a short period, as I have done, without being aware that the educational system in Edinburgh, the division into the independent grant-aided, local authority fee-paying, and local authority non-fee-paying schools, plays a tremendous part in the social attitudes and ideas of people in Edinburgh, particularly those of the middle-class or aspiring middle-class, and produces a situation which is socially extremely damaging. That was my experience of living in Edinburgh. My hon. Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Mackintosh) and my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis), who have lived in these areas for very much longer than I, have simply confirmed what has been my deep feeling about the situation in Edinburgh. It is no use the Opposition saying that that is not a fact about the Edinburgh situation, because, for good or ill, it is a fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition would not use that argument, but they have used a number of other arguments with which I want to deal. There is the argument of parental choice. It is true that there are circumstances in which the payment of fees can mean a widening of parental choice, such as when the payment of fees guarantees choice or increases the chances of the parents being able to choose the education they wish for their child. But as soon as the payment of fees guarantees choice, merit does not come into the argument. Hon. Members opposite have been very anxious at all points in the argument to say that that is not what they have in mind. But if we begin to restrict or inhibit choice in the payment of fees by arguments of merit, parental choice, in the purest sense, goes out the window. The Opposition will not advocate that openly. Some of them would
	<span class='label label-info column'>226</span>
like to do so. Some of them believe that that is what the system should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As soon, however, as we introduce the question of merit, the argument does not stand up to serious examination. Even if we say that the argument is, as the situation is, that the payment of fees allows, not an absolute choice, but an advantage to parents who pay the fees as against those who do not, the argument is insupportable if one believes in equality of opportunity all round. If one believes in equality of opportunity all round, it is possible to take the view that everything should be decided on merit. That is a false view in the sense that any attempt to do that inevitably does not succeed to the extent of anything like 100 per cent.; it succeeds very unevenly. That is an argument which one could respect, but there is no place for fee paying in an argument of that sort, if fee paying is meant to give additional advantage to one child compared with another. But that is what happens in the fee-paying sector of local authority education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In all the arguments and speeches of hon. Members opposite primary schools were virtually not mentioned at all, but let us consider what happens in the primary schools in Edinburgh and Glasgow, which are the two areas which seemingly greatly excite the Opposition. There is selection, some at the age of 5 and some a little bit later. At the transfer stage, at 12 years of age, a very large proportion of the places at the secondary level are pre-empted by fee-paying pupils from the primary departments of fee-paying schools. An hon. Gentleman says that that is not true. The figures which I have are not as up to date as they might be, but, in 1965-66, at the Royal High School in Edinburgh, with an entry of 132 pupils, only 31 pupils came from non fee-paying schools. The other 101 pupils came from the fee-paying primary departments. The same is true about James Gillespie's. Those are the two main local authority fee-paying schools in Edinburgh. I could produce similar figures for Glasgow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point is not that boys do or do not go on to the secondary stage. The word with which I would quarrel in the hon. Gentleman's argument is "pre-empted". It is clear that there is no pre-emption. The parents of every child who goes into the primary
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0573">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>227</span>
department are told clearly that there is no guarantee whatever that the child will reach the secondary department.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In practice very, very few primary department pupils do not move on to the secondary department. Given the kind of system that there is, that can only he right. It would he appalling to take a child into the fee-paying primary department at 5 years of age and then tell him at 12 years of age that he cannot move up to the senior school but must go somewhere else. On the assumptions on which the system is based, I do not complain about this, but I do complain about the assumptions on which the system is based and about the facts as we have them in Edinburgh and Glasgow as distinct from the idealised version of them which is obviously current in the minds of hon. Members opposite.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be interesting if, at some convenient moment, probably not during his speech, my hon. Friend could tell us how many of the primary school pupils have been refused places at the secondary schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire gave a particular example. I cannot quote offhand the extent of the competition in either city, but one knows from personal experience that the competition is such that very large numbers of pupils are not able to obtain entry to fee-paying secondary departments. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East pointed out, the argument about parental choice does not apply in that situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In so far as the secondary places are pre-empted by pupils from the primary school, there is not selection by merit at 12 years of age. Largely the selection system operates long before the age of 12. In other areas where there are primary schools the idea that they should be maintained within a comprehensive system is absurd, because if secondary education is organised on comprehensive lines any reason that there might be for fee-paying primary schools disappears completely. I do not believe that we need argue seriously about the existence of fee-paying primary schools when the secondary system is comprehensive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>228</span>
It is demonstrable that to attach the arguments which the Opposition have tried to attach to the issue of fees is a complete absurdity. One hon. Member opposite, the hon. Member for Cath-cart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) recognised that the issue is not about fees. That is why he made the best speech from the Opposition benches. He recognised that to get excited about fee-paying as such is simply to misplace the core of the argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend give me some credit for what has happened? I converted the hon. Member for Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) on Second Reading into believing that fees are not the issue. I had an influence on the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was a little surprised to hear the hon. Member for Cathcart talking sense. I now see that it came from my hon. Friend. Nevertheless, the hon. Member for Cathcart made a good speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument cannot rest on the question of fees, for one reason. Geographically speaking, it is an absolute nonsense in Scotland, because at the secondary level we are talking simply about Glasgow and Edinburgh. Most hon. Members opposite represent areas in which there is no fee paying in the secondary system at the moment and there will not be any fee paying in future. Therefore, to attach importance to the question of fees demonstrates a complete inability on the part of hon. Members opposite to understand the argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was typical of the muddle of hon. Members opposite that, while they were expounding the virtues of fees, they were at the same time saying how glad they would be to see the number of free places in fee-paying schools increased. One of my hon. Friends pointed out that what they wanted was more fee-paying schools and all the places to be free.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Galloway spoke with considerable assurance about areas other than his own. I would not care to speak with such assurance about the situation in south-west Scotland. He seemed to think that about 25 per cent. of the places were free. What are the facts? At the Royal High School, out of an entry of 130 at the S1 stage, 20 places are free. At James Gillespie's, the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0574">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>229</span>
girl's school, there are 10 free places out of 125. There are no free places at Trinity Academy. That gives a total number of free places in the Edinburgh fee-paying schools of about 150 out of 5,950. In Glasgow, only one fee-paying school offers free places, Allen Glen's. It offers 50 places out of 170 at the S1 stage. It offers a small additional number of free places a year after that. Therefore, the total number of free places at that school is about 195. But that is the only school in Glasgow which offers free places. Therefore, the total number of free places in Glasgow is 195 out of 5,180.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether hon. Members opposite think that that is a desirable situation. Presumably, if they believe in the virtues of fee paying, it is very desirable. But they are in a complete muddle. They want fee-paying schools and to increase the number of free places. Hon. Members opposite—and this applies to the hon. Member for Galloway—have not even acquainted themselves with the basic facts, let alone the arguments, about the system as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the basic matter which we are discussing, namely, selection. I will not repeat what I said earlier about why the selective system of education, involving selection at 12 years of age, does not meet the educational or other needs of our people, but I wish to make one or two comments, in particular, about the idea that a comprehensive system and a selective system can live side by side within the same area. I do not put this forward as a matter of dogmatism; I simply state it as a fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One cannot have the two systems operating side by side and have either of them operating satisfactorily. Those of us who believe that selection is wrong and that the comprehensive system must be developed must face the fact, and hon. Members opposite must face the fact, that the selective system cannot be allowed to continue side by side with the comprehensive system, because it is a contradiction in terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That does not mean that the question of parental choice is unimportant or that it should be set aside. I have said that in a selective system parental choice for most parents is a farce; it does not work. One is either in or out. If one
	<span class='label label-info column'>230</span>
is out, parental choice has nothing to do with it. I attach tremendous importance to the idea of parental choice within the comprehensive system. In one or two areas in Scotland, where the comprehensive reorganisation plans have been based on a two-tier system of junior high school and senior high school, the Department, on my instructions, has in every case—and there are not many cases—made it clear to the education authority that in the transfer of pupils between junior high school and senior high school, not simply at the age of 14 at the end of S2, but sometimes at the age of 16 at the end of S4, parental choice should be given the maximum consideration. I gather from the expression on the face of the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) that he agrees with me in this matter. We made this point the other day to the Ayr local authority in respect of Largs High School.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Without wishing to introduce a constituency point, I would be grateful for the Minister's assurance that this operates within the area of the Sutherland County Council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly the general principle operates there, although I do not want to go into the complicated nature of the arguments in Sutherland. We have made the position clear there as well, that parental choice is an extremely important factor in any transfer of pupils. We did the same in the case of the Renfrew authority, which has adopted the system in some parts of Renfrewshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same thing applies within the comprehensive system itself. In other words, decisions about the kinds of subject and courses which pupils should be taking in comprehensive schools must increasingly be regarded as matters of parental choice. We are far from an ideal world in which that now happens in all our comprehensive schools. Never-less, it is the intention of the Government—indeed, I hope that all hon. Members share this view—that parental choice within the comprehensive system should be made a real and live thing and should not simply be a matter of, so to speak, a face-saving formula.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to 'the main argument about the impossibility of having a selective system
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0575">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>231</span>
and a comprehensive system running side by side. It is interesting to see the precise position in regard to fee-paying schools in Edinburgh and Glasgow. There is a tendency to say that since they represent only a comparatively small part of the entire system the effective creaming done by these schools can only be a minor issue in these two cities. That is not the situation, particularly when we consider the senior classes; that is, S5 and S6. In Glasgow, at the S5 level, 20 per cent of the fifth year pupils go to corporation fee-paying schools. The other 80 per cent., of course, go to non fee-paying schools. In Edinburgh the situation is a good deal worse, because at the fifth year level no fewer than 30 per cent. of pupils in Edinburgh authority schools are in fee-paying schools, while in the sixth year the percentage has increased to 33–4. There is, therefore, a considerable element of creaming within the system as we have it now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With that sort of creaming going on it is not possible to get a really satisfactory comprehensive system in either of these cities, partly because of the effect of it on the comprehensive schools in academic terms—it increases their difficulties in trying to build up viable fifth and sixth year elements—and partly for social reasons, because it affects the general attitude of the community towards the non fee-paying sector of local education. Nobody who knows about the Edinburgh system will deny that this is an important factor in the situation in that city, and in Glasgow the situation is the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Looking at the argument from the point of view of the pupils, the people with whom we are concerned, it is interesting to note that no hon. Gentleman opposite has attempted to demonstrate that the selective system, allied with fee-paying arrangements, produces better results for less able pupils. It is agreed that the less able do better under a nonselective system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What about the more able pupils? I have never believed that our system should be based on the proposition that our only concern should be for the more able. To suggest that it should is to misread the sort of situation which we are facing and the need for a very large number of our people to be highly educated
	<span class='label label-info column'>232</span>
and skilled, technologically and in every other way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In terms of the most able pupils, it is worth considering what is happening at fee-paying schools now. Hon. Gentlemen opposite have said that these pupils come from homes where the parents show a deep interest in education. I accept that. An interesting fact, however, is that—I am not theorising, because a number of research studies have recently been made into the matter—pupils who come from family backgrounds where the parents show a deep interest in their children's education always do well, regardless of the schools they attend. Indeed, they do well even if they attend junior secondary schools. Their attainment in relation to their ability, as far as we can make an assessment in this matter, is always higher than the attainment of children who come from homes where the parents are neglectful of education, and children from such backgrounds always attain less than their natural ability. This means that children who at present attend feepaying schools and who have parents interested in their education will, according to all the evidence, do equally well in comprehensive or any other types of school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is for this reason that I do not believe that there will be any disadvantage for any pupil or group of pupils in the conversion of fee-paying schools to non-fee-paying schools, any more than there has been any disadvantage in the conversion of senior secondary schools which are not fee-paying schools to comprehensive schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an important aspect of the matter. I say that because, if it could be demonstrated that there were large numbers of able pupils who would suffer from the elimination of selection, then that would be a serious argument which we would have carefully to consider against the comprehensive system. But that cannot be demonstrated for a number of reasons, including the one I have given.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>233</span>
secondary schools in Scotland and secondary modern schools in England. The principle is that pupils do up to the limit of their ability. That is the general pattern. I naturally cannot account for every individual pupil. Suffice to say that, for the reasons I have given, I do not believe that the conversion of senior secondary schools into comprehensive schools will result in pupils losing out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cath-cart said that not every comprehensive school had the same sort of social intake. So far as that is true—and it is true to some extent in our cities—it is a deplorable situation and one which, as far as possible, we should try to put right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will not interrupt me, I will explain.

This situation applies in only small and limited areas of Scotland. It is partly a question of zoning and partly a question of not giving preference to schools in better areas and giving preference to schools in worse areas. This is what we are trying to do—I agree in a limited way; it needs to be developed—with small additional payments to teachers who are prepared to go to schools in areas which have a teacher shortage. It is part of the function of any Government who care about equality in education to see that increasing attention is given to these schools and that they are not allowed to languish while the more favourable schools go ahead.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Esmond Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What does the Minister mean by his reference to" preference"? Does he include the movement of students and pupils by bus from poorer to better class areas?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe that the problem can be solved in that way. It does not necessarily follow that, because a school is in what would be considered a socially poorer area, it is necessarily worse than a school in what would be considered a socially better area. There are many excellent comprehensive schools in what are called socially poor areas in which there is among parents little background of education beyond the minimum school-leaving age. I can think of one comprehensive school in
	<span class='label label-info column'>234</span>
Glasgow which is excellent but in which not one pupil—I mean this literally—comes from a professional background. That is a deplorable state of affairs and arises from gross errors in housing policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The errors of a Socialist corporation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We cannot meet this challenge by avoiding it or by continuing a system which allows a very small number of parents in the area to contract out of the problem. In the fee-paying schools children are not coming solely from the Easterhouse and other difficult areas—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is dealing with an important aspect of the problem. Would he say something about the other side of this coin? For example, is he not creating a very difficult educational challenge for himself in proposing to convert the Royal High School in Edinburgh into a comprehensive school? Will not that limit the children in that school to a particular class and make the position more socially divisive than it is now?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know Edinburgh in terms of geography as well as I know Glasgow. I have had the fee-paying schools in Glasgow classified by postal districts to discover from where the pupils come. Any idea that in Glasgow we have fee-paying schools with a complete social spread is absolute nonsense. Many children in Glasgow's fee-paying schools come from, for example, my constituency, which is not a poor district. My area has good housing with a fair spread of middle-class population.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That does not answer my question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The same applies to Edinburgh. We cannot solve the problem of inequality of opportunity resulting from unequal social conditions and backgrounds by the fee-paying system, which creams off a comparatively small number of children and leaves the rest to put up with the best that they can get, with the result that some of our schools suffer from a severe teacher shortage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have made a similar postal district study in Edinburgh. My study showed that the children came from a very much wider area. However, would the Minister now say what will be the

impact on the Royal High School of his proposal in terms of social divisiveness?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to the social problems involved. I have been dealing, the hon. Gentleman may consider at excessive length, with some of the more general problems. I have been trying to analyse the argument. There has been such a conspicuous lack of clarity opposite that I hope I have made our position clear.

The practical problems involved here are, in principle, no different from those involved in other parts of Scotland in the conversion of senior secondary schools to the comprehensive system. That is not to say that all the schools may not present particular problems, in the short term. I told Edinburgh Corporation a very long time ago, and Glasgow Corporation, that if they would put up proposals for the integration of these schools within the comprehensive system, looking at the position seriously, if they would bring proposals which they said had to be modified considerably, because of their practical problems, I would be prepared to look at those problems as sympathetically as I could. That offer still stands. Neither authority has brought forward any kind of proposals, and I have not been able to talk with them about the practical problems. I repeat the offer now. I am not unmindful of the practical problems involved in some of these areas, and am willing to look at anything that the education authorities bring to me. After fee-paying is abolished I hope that we shall be able to talk about these problems in a constructive way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brewis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would it not be much more logical to make no Order until the practical problems have been resolved?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If no Order is made, then no proposals will be brought forward by either authority. I met both authorities a long time ago, and we talked about these problems exhaustively. Glasgow promised to send proposals, which never came. In the other case, Edinburgh has not produced any proposals at all. The time has now passed for that, and it would be undesirable that there should be a long period of uncertainty about the future of these schools, which is why
	<span class='label label-info column'>236</span>
my right hon. Friend has decided that the Order he will bring in eventually will date from the end of the school session 1969–70.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When dealing with these specific dates can the Minister give an indication of what the Government's general view is about those who are in these schools now, who may be in their second, third or fourth year? Will they change to another school, or will they be allowed to be phased out of their own school?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The problem is exactly the same as has happened in any other senior secondary school in Scotland. It is very unlikely that any existing pupils would be moved from their schools; rather they will be allowed to continue the kind of education they have been receiving. I am talking now about the secondary pupils. The primary situation is rather different. It is up to the authority to bring proposals to me, and I would be happy to look at them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that he discussed this with Edinburgh Corporation a long time ago. Does this mean that he discussed the Royal High School before it moved out? I have been informed that no kind of warning was given.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not so. The situation about the Royal High School was discussed before it moved. I did not discuss it personally, because it was before my time at the Scottish Office, but Edinburgh Corporation has known the situation about the Royal High School in terms of comprehensive reorganisation at least since Circular 600 went out, in October, 1965. When I met the Corporation, I think it was January, 1967, we talked about individual schools, including the Royal High School, but the authority has not brought forward any proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman be good enough to consider two points? May I remind him that in May, 1967, he assured me, in reply to a Parliamentary Question, that, during these discussions, there would be no bludgeoning of the local authorities? Yet this Bill is the biggest bludgeon of all. Secondly, is he seriously proposing to introduce this order, effective next year, without having made, as he admits, any
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0578">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>237</span>
serious study of the practical consequences of the schools?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I have made such a study. In the first place the initiative rests with the education authority, to give the Government its ideas as to what might happen with these schools. With Edinburgh, we asked about the problems involving individual schools, but the initiative will rest with the authorities once the Bill has gone through.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman now answer my question about the Royal High School?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have answered it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brewis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about an authority like Renfrewshire, which has co-operated with the hon. Gentleman's policy and decided to abolish fee-paying over seven years?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The education authority in Renfrewshire decided to abolish fee-paying as from 1969. That was a decision taken before the Bill was introduced. I do not know what the hon. Gentleman means by saying seven years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brewis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is being phased out over seven years, so I understood.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has it wrong. Fees are not being phased out. They are being abolished from 1969. The hon. Gentleman is taking up a point made by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart. Renfrewshire is not doing this by removing all pupils from the Paisley Grammar and putting them somewhere else, and I would have thought it extremely unlikely that such a thing would happen with Edinburgh or Glasgow. What has happened in Renfrewshire is of some assurance to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart.

I have tried to answer some of the points of principle which seem to be involved here. I have also dealt with some of the practical problems. The Opposition were muddled on this, and, whether they like it or not, certainly subconsciously, they have a feeling which is for Scotland élite-ist, out of date, and not even traditional to the Scottish character of democracy in education. What they have put forward is not even based on the realities of the fee-paying system. This is essentially a minor and overdue reform
	<span class='label label-info column'>238</span>
about which we have talked for a very long time. It is one that we want to put through with the maximum speed, and for that reason I ask the Committee to reject the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are all grateful——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. In view of my hon. Friend's speech would it not be in order for the Opposition to give in, to capitulate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is not a point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure if the hon. Gentleman can have been listening properly to his hon. Friend's speech. Although we are grateful to him for taking so long to skate around the problems, only at one brief moment in his long speech could I begin to think he might come to the real nub of the problem. For most of the time he lashed about like a wounded whale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As all the speeches of his hon. Friends included different suggestions about fee-paying schools, it was very clever of him to put on the main plank of his argument the suggestion that the Opposition did not have the same ideas. Every one of my hon. Friends has been making the same point with great clarity and precision, led by my hon. Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) and ably backed up by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) with his great personal knowledge of this subject. In lashing around like this the Minister has gone for another old and extremely useful technique. If one does not have a good argument it is always wise to take the arguments of the Opposition, put one's own gloss on them, make them one's own and then defeat them. I would not find it difficult to do that to the Minister's arguments. The Minister's speech has been largely irrelevant and has not attempted to deal with the real nub of the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He asked whether it was right to concentrate educational money, skill, and resources on the best schools, or the less than best schools. In a moment of great conviction he said that it was his view that the right thing was to concentrate
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0579">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>239</span>
all we could on finding teachers, resources, and so on, for the less successful schools, for those schools which needed to be brought up to the general standard. At that point, I warmly agreed with the Minister. When we are limited in our resources, when the Government are making cuts in so many aspects of education, then it is right to concentrate all that we can on the less privileged schools, where there are shortages of buildings and teachers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman kindly refrain from repeating this canard which comes from the Opposition with tedious regularity that the Government are making cuts in educational programmes? As he very well knows, this is an entirely misleading statement. What is happening is that the rate of growth of public expenditure is being slowed up. If he calls that a cut, then he is a more devious man than I took him to be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member was not in the House five or six years ago, but if he was in touch with things in Scotland he may know that every local authority which was Socialist-controlled during the period of office of the last Conservative Government went through an annual exercise of asking for many millions of pounds for school building, knowing very well that they could not carry it all out, because there were not
	<span class='label label-info column'>240</span>
the resources. When the inevitably big request was reduced by a small amount, my goodness, then we had talk about cuts in education, even if the total amount being spent was increased by 20 per cent. as it was in some cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend explain to me and the hon. Gentleman how a reduction from £46 million in 1964 on university building to £17 million this year—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is this in order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The point about cuts is well taken and we should not pursue it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely take the point of my hon. Friend—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I said, let us not pursue it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not do so, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman who raised it will realise that it is not such a good point as he thought.
