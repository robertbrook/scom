	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed:</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee have considered:</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Class IV, Vote 5, Roads and Transport Services, Scotland; and</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Class VI, Vote 2, Scottish Development Department.—[	<i>Dr. Dickson Mabon.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very glad to be starting a discussion this morning on transport in the Highlands and Islands. When one is considering the problems of the Highlands and when one is concerned, as we all are, with increasing activity and development in the Highlands, it becomes clear that transport is a vital factor. That applies not only to transport within the area but also to communications with the rest of Scotland and with the rest of Britain. Inside the area one finds physical barriers of hills and water which produce problems which are not met in many other parts of Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As an example of the importance of communications with the rest of Britain I shall take the A.9 road. For those in the Committee who visit the Highlands or live nearby it is certainly striking that many of the bodies and persons concerned with the development and welfare of the Highlands generally are especially concerned that the road leading north to their area should be improved as fast as possible. The point is that this is concerned with expenditure outwith the Highland area. They are recommending that money should be spent on a road outwith their area, because of the importance of speedy communications with the south. This is important to those who are considering setting up industry or engaging in other activities in the Highland area, particularly the north and north-west Highlands, because they are concerned at the time which it will take a lorry to move north and south, to and from a new site.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, of course, there is the important point about tourist traffic, both
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>150</span>
in the summer and in the winter, with the development of winter sports which has taken place, because there are parts of that road where one slow lorry can hold up the rest of the traffic to the north and north-west of Scotland. I am very glad to have the support of my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor), who will be winding up this debate for our side of the Committee, because he——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archie Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He is an expert on everything.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. G. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not quite hear what the hon. Gentleman said, but my hon. Friend is an expert, because he specialises in transport matters and will, no doubt, be dealing with transport in the Highlands related to the rest of Scotland and the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to refer to the Report of the Highlands Transport Board. It is now about two years old, but many of its recommendations are still highly relevant. That Board was set up in 1963 by my right hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble), whom I am very glad to see in the Committee, and I hope he will be able to give us an account of the situation in his part of the Highlands. The Board reported in 1967, although its functions had been taken over by the Highlands and Islands Development Board, and I shall refer to two or three of its recommendations as I go along.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to deal in order with roads, rail, sea and air. They are all related, but I think it is convenient to consider them separately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should first like to deal with the controversy about the best route for the road north of Inverness. This affects Caithness and Sutherland, in particular, and it is not easy to see what is the right answer. But, clearly, where a lot of money has to be spent—and we hope it will be spent in the coming years—it is important to get the right answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Briefly, there are some who suggest that if a short route is taken, which probably means a causeway at Kessock and a route over the Black Isle and then a bridge over the Dornoch Firth, that would mean a much shorter route with less first-class road to be maintained. It would cut out 20 or more miles. It is difficult for us in Opposition to be able to work out the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0291">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>151</span>
costs, because we cannot know all the factors involved. I wrote to the Secretary of State about three months ago, asking him to make sure that no final decision was taken on this until the whole matter had been looked into from a long-term point of view, and I am glad to say that the answer which I received was that the matter had not been decided, that the importance of looking very carefully at the alternatives was recognised, and that this matter was still being looked into. The choice seems to be between developing the present road, making it a dual carriageway or otherwise improving it, going round by Beauly and then over Struie, which is the way round the Dornoch Firth, and which means going over some fairly high ground which is not always easy in the winter. The other alternative is to build a causeway and a bridge over the Dornoch Firth, which would, no doubt, be expensive. I gather that something ike £1 million would be involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question is whether, taking a period of 10 or 15 years, it might be cheaper to adopt the latter course, since the maintenance of 20 or more miles of main road would not be required. I hope that the Government will tell us that this is being looked into very carefully. I recognise that it may be. difficult in the present economic situation to Undertake capital expenditure of this kind; but if it is going to save money in the long run it ought to be seriously considered. The point is—and I need hardly tell the hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Mr; Maclennan)—that it would mean a much shorter and direct route north and south from Wick and Thurso and areas nearby, and would make communications and travel to work easier, as well as generally alleviating the transport problem for the north of Scotland. I recognise that where the cauesway proposal over Kessock is concerned, there are problems concerning the tide, as well as problems for the herring and sprat fisheries. We cannot know the answers to these problems, but we do know that the problems exist and hope that they are being carefully considered. We also know that there has been the Holmes Study, which made one suggestion, but that is not the last answer; it is simply a contribution. While there are problems, there may also be advantages. It has been represented that an enclosed inner firth within the causeway
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>152</span>
might have very great attractions for tourists, so there may be some pros as well as cons in this suggestion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As one who has had experience of Government, and now as Opposition spokesman, does the hon. Gentleman think that on a subject of this sort Opposition spokesmen should have access to the Civil Service statisticians?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My understanding is that when it is a question of producing statistics all Members of Parliament can usually get them, but it is sometimes a little difficult to secure them through the Library or through Answers to Parliamentary Questions, if they are very recent statistics which are just coming out. All I can say is that, although it sometimes involves a certain amount of work, on the whole I usually manage to obtain what is available. I think the complaint is usually that, when it is a question of jobs, which is more a subject for the Department for Employment and Productivity, it is very difficult to get up-to-date information. One is always a year or a year and a half behind. That is more of a problem than accessibility. But I agree with the hon. Gentleman that it is important to be able to get the facts, so far as matters affecting the Scottish Office are concerned, provided that the Government are prepared to make them available and provided that it is not confidential information affecting firms and so on. With a certain amount of digging one can usually get what one wants. But I recognise that the hon. Gentleman sometimes pursues matters in the defence field, and statistics on that are in rather a different category.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the hon. Gentleman to tell us the latest information about the Government's thinking on the Dornoch Firth Bridge. I recognise that it is probably an expensive project, but it is important for the north of Scotland; Also, can the hon; Gentleman tell us the latest position as regards the road which he announced in this Committee about two years' ago was being built? I refer to the road around Loch Carron to replace the Strome Ferry. I hope to be there on a visit in about a month's time, provided the House rises at the expected time, and I shall no doubt see it for myself, but we should like to know the latest position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At this point I turn to rail. Of course, the lines which particularly concern us
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0292">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>153</span>
are those to the west from Inverness to Kyle of Lochalsh and north to Wick. Two years ago the line to Kyle of Lochalsh was put by the Government on the list of those lines which were due to be closed. It was one of the grey lines on the map. But I understand that this was dependent upon the state of the roads and the road access to Kyle. I hope that the hon. Gentleman can tell us something about this. It is a matter for great anxiety in the area, as I am sure the hon. Member for Ross and Cromarty (Mr. Alasdair Mackenzie) will agree.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely that was not the first occasion on which a shadow fell over that particular line. We had a very big battle over it in 1963.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is anticipating what I am going to say. I quite agree with him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was also going to mention the Wick line, which was in the same position. The line from Inverness to Wick did not have this grey shadow over it two years ago, but in the last week or two we have noticed in the Press that the line from Inverness to Wick appears to be threatened. As the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) said, both of these lines were recommended by Dr. Beeching for closure, but five years ago it was decided by the then Government, the Government formed by this side, specifically to retain those lines after a full investigation of the economic and social arguments as well as others. I recognise that two years ago the position of the line to Kyle was reviewed, and that it was then made a grey line subject to being terminated. But ho time limit was set upon that and it is the matter of timing with which we are concerned. I hope the Minister will be able to say something about this today. I hope he will be very frank about it because it has been difficult to follow some of these events.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I give the example of the line from Perth to Inverness because at the end of 1966 there was considerable concern about this line. I put down a number of Questions to the Minister of Transport about its future, and, every time, I got the reply that there was no possibility or suggestion that it was being considered for closure. One
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>154</span>
of my constituents wrote a letter in 	<i>The Scotsman</i> and a senior British Railways spokesman wrote in reply in 	<i>The Scotsman</i> giving an absolute assurance that there was no question of closure of that line being considered, but in March, 1967, a few weeks later, at a Press conference in London, the then Minister of Transport announced that the line had been saved and the U.K. Press, including the London 	<i>Times,</i> which had not been following this in detail, had front page headlines that the line to Inverness was being saved. But replies to all the Questions I had on the record in HANSARD indicated that it had never been threatened. This indicates why it is difficult to follow these things and I hope the Minister will be frank with us today. At the time I called it, after Conan Doyle, the Case of the Phantom Axe. We do not mind a phantom axe if it works out that way, but it is disquieting if the position is reversed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope the hon. Gentleman will work closely with the Minister of Transport. Although his particular responsibility is for roads we all agree that in these areas the roads and railways have a direct relationship. The Government had said that the future of the line between Inverness and Kyle of Lochalsh is dependent on the road access to Kyle, particularly so that it is passable in winter conditions as well in the summer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do not believe everything you read in 	<i>The Times.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, but I may say it was the London 	<i>Times.</i> I only mention that because I happened to take a cutting from it. It was in the other U.K. newspapers at the time, and other Members on both sides of the Committee, like me, expressed surprise when it happened; I happened to take one or two cuttings to remind myself of the point and I took it up with the Minister of Transport afterwards and she could give no explanation as to why this happened. We want to make sure that these decisions, after all the consideration that was given five years ago to the lines north of Wick and Kyle, are taken only after full consideration. As for the Perth to Inverness line, that was not on Dr. Beeching's list.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to turn to sea transport. The Islands are very dependent on good sea services, and the cost of these services
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0293">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>155</span>
is a matter of great concern. I would like to ask the Minister a question on this most important point which is topical at the moment. What is the Government's attitude towards private operators where they can show that they are doing a good job without subsidy and managing to keep costs down? This seems to be happening and it may increase. In Norway, where ferries have to be used a great deal because of the indentation of the coastline, which is similar to ours in west Scotland, ferries are able to give a very good service for reasonable charges and without very expensive installations, and it seems that we in Scotland may be able, like the Norwegians, to develop cheaper methods of running ferries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that Messrs. MacBrayne have done and are doing a necessary job, but, in view of these developments, which could greatly help the taxpayer as well as assisting the islanders concerned, the Government will have to look again and decide whether to encourage or discourage competition of this kind with MacBrayne's services. Only yesterday I read of an example in 	<i>The Glasgow Herald</i> which raises questions in our minds. It was reported that the Scottish Transport Group seemed to have insisted on some particular kind of boat for the ferry between Kyle of Lochalsh and Kyleakin and the report I have says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Lord Macdonald, Inverness county convener, yesterday accused the Scottish Transport Group of holding a pistol to the head of the county council on the question of the type of boat to be used for the ferry linking Skye and the mainland."</p></blockquote>
Could the hon. Gentleman tell us how this arises? The article goes on to say that the Inverness County Council is complaining because the particular kind of boat insisted upon meant three times the cost of the pier installation required for an alternative type. Naturally it is disquieting to read this in the Press, and we would like the Minister to tell us how this can happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to the Pentland Firth, and I was glad of the opportunity recently to look at the area where consideration is being given to a new ferry crossing from the mainland to Orkney across the Pentland Firth. One of the recommendations of the Highlands Transport Board was that there should be a comprehensive study of a new service of this kind which would greatly assist Orkney, particularly with
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>156</span>
tourist traffic in the summer, which appears to be increasing in demand. It is also reported in the Press that the Highlands Development Board has been carrying out such a study, and in fact has completed it, and the Press indicated that it had either been presented and not been published by the Government or not yet been presented. Could the Minister clarify the position as to whether this study has been completed, whether it has been presented to the Government, and whether the study, or parts of it, will be made public later?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman leaves that point would he care to say from his study of this problem whether he favours the crossing from Scrabster or the crossing from John o'Groats—or whether he favours both of them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not had time to make a study; I wish I had, but if I did this I should not be able to do many of the other things I have to interest myself in. I was interested in looking at what was proposed. I went to both the places the hon. Gentleman mentioned, but not being an expert, and not having time to make a study, I could not come to a conclusion myself on this. But I heard the views of many of those in the area on the advantages that they thought such a service could bring, and that it could be done without great expenditure on shore installations. I am asking the Government, who have the advantage of a comprehensive study, to tell us what the latest position is, and the hon. Gentleman will be as interested as I am in hearing the Minister's reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regarding another water crossing, Ballachulish, I would ask the Government if they can tell us anything further about the project for a bridge. This was mentioned in the White Paper, Scottish Roads in the 1970s. It was mentioned as a project receiving comprehensive appraisal, so I hope that the Minister can now, in July before the Recess, give us the latest information on that. Clearly this and similar projects are dependent upon money, and they have to be given priorities. We recognise that the country is in a bad economic situation. I will not go into all the reasons for that. We on this side of the Committee know them. One has
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0294">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>157</span>
to accept it as a fact, and the high interest rates and the squeeze and the other factors which make it difficult for projects of this kind to be started. Nevertheless the Government have to allot priorities, and I would like to know the priority given to the Ballachulish bridge as it would speed up transport on the west road to the north of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regarding air travel, besides the B.E.A. Viscount services, which have increased in the last two or three years, there is definitely a place for small aircraft, particularly in operations to and from the Islands. This is a field in which not only B.E.A. but also small private aircraft can be run by private enterprise. This is something which those in the area feel can contribute greatly to help them in their daily lives in their need to go between the Islands and to the mainland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also important that when a new service comes on it ought to be given some publicity. When the new service came on from Dalcross—I had been trying to get it for a year—I found that large numbers of people in the area did not know it existed. Although the new schedules had come out, it had not been reported in the local Press in such a way that people would know about it. At the time when it was decided upon and announced it was very much news in the area. If it had been handled in the right way it would have been headline news in the local Press and there would have been no need for expensive publicity. I suggest that any influence the Government can bring they should bring upon the nationalised industries—where there is some extra service coming in which has been called for and has been headline news—to arrange that it should be announced in such a way that people hear about it and know of its existence. It is important that those who want to use the service should know it is available, otherwise it will not have the patronage it ought to get. One has the suspicion—I do not level this at B.E.A., but I do at British Railways—that they have not taken the trouble because they rather hope that the new service will not be used much and after about a year they will be able to take it off again. This is not our object at all; therefore, I again suggest that public relations of a simple kind could make sure that free publicity would be obtained for new services which had been very much demanded by the local authorities and Members of Parliament,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>158</span>
and with the result that most people in the area would know about them when they came in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would agree, of course, with the hon. Gentleman's attempt to introduce more air services to the Highlands, but has he had any consultations with B.E.A. on his suggestion of introducing private operators to these services, and does he realise that B.E.A. also has small aircraft which could fit very well into those services which he has suggested?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know what the hon. Gentleman has just said. Private operators have been providing services as well as B.E.A. Personally, I think competition of this kind is healthy. My main point is that those bodies concerned with development in the Highlands, as well as individuals, feel that small aircraft could help towards improving communications between the Highlands and the mainland.

I would like to come to the question of quantity licensing. The Minister of State and I and my hon. Friend were all engaged in the marathon of the Transport Bill last year. Briefly, it means that road transport of 16 tons laden weight or over will have to have, from a certain date, a special authorisation to go more than 100 miles. This is a short distance for anyone with a business in the Highlands who has to send goods to or collect goods from the south or east of Scotland and farther distances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends and I were able to exempt round timber from this. That was a great help to the Highlands. We were also able to exempt livestock. Thank heavens we were. The Islands were also exempted—but only transport within them; not journeys starting within an island and extending more than 100 miles into the mainland of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the Minister of State and the Minister of Transport said that for the Highlands and Islands it could virtually be taken that every application for special authorisation would be granted. If the Minister of State thinks that I have simplified it, he can put a gloss on it, but certainly that is the impression which was given to the Highlands—that they need not worry because virtually every

application for special authorisation would be granted. For most of the area this must be so, because the railways serve only a small part of the Highlands and Islands. However, industry and business in the area is anxious about the unnecessary palaver which this will cause. They will have to fill in forms, and they do not know whether it will take days or weeks before they get authorisation. If they have to do something at short notice they fear that they will have to wait a long time before getting the necessary bit of paper, unless there is an emergency. Fortunately, again, during the passage of the Bill my hon. Friend and I succeeded in getting the Minister to postpone the date, and with any luck the date will not be before we again take office. We hope so, and I am sure that those in the Highlands and Islands hope so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member will, of course, realise that, with regard to quantity licensing, he is merely rehearsing the misrepresentation of the provisions of the Act which he has perpetrated throughout the Highlands and Islands of Scotland to the great disadvantage of industry thereby frightening off incoming industries?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland has not done any homework on this. I have not made speeches on this in the Highlands. I was invited by the committee, set up soon after the Transport Bill was published, to meetings which it held in Inverness and which the hon. Member attended as well as other hon. Members representing Highland constituencies, particularly the hon. Members for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) and Ross and Cromarty. We all attended that conference and we were invited to attend further meetings of the committee which was formed. He is in the same position as I, because we listened to what those in the area said, that they were anxious about the conditions, and we did what we could to get the Bill changed. I do not think I misrepresent the position because I know that part of the Transport Act almost off by heart.

The fact remains that, even if every application is granted—and I hope that the hon. Member will mark that I said the Government had indicated that this was their attitude—none the less people are anxious about the palaver of filling in forms and, perhaps, not being able to operate at short notice. I am not making speeches in the Highlands frightening people. People have been writing to me about it. In many cases I have been able to allay their alarm and suspicion by quoting the Government's words in Committee and in the House of Commons that virtually every application in the Highlands and Islands will be granted. The question is whether they believe it or not. That brings into account the credibility of the Government, and I cannot help them on that. I contest, dispute and completely refute what the hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland said about my action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the troubles is also that of return loads for lorries, because where there is a long-distance journey between north and south there is a difficulty about the special authorisation at short notice for return loads which would make journeys economic for industrial and commercial firms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think hon. Members opposite will agree that we went about that in a businesslike way by pressing the Minister of Transport who, having just come from the Ministry of Power, was doing his best to try to help, but he was saddled with a system which, if it ever comes into operation, will cause the difficulties and apprehensions I have mentioned. I do not think I have overstressed them, but that I have been moderate in the way that I have put them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then there is the question of cost. Every time the Government produce an increase in fuel tax or licence duties it is felt more acutely in the north and northwest of Scotland than anywhere else in the country because distance enters everybody's lives there to a greater extent than it does in the lives of people in any other part of the country. Most goods have to come long distances to the shops, and communities live considerable distances from one another. This means that when the costs of private transport and commer-. cial vehicles increase they are more harshly felt in the Highlands and Islands than anywhere else. Perhaps the most helpful thing which any Government could do for this area would be to assist in bringing down the cost of transport and

giving high priority to improving communications within the area and with the rest of the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Dickson Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is now two years since we debated the Report on Highland transport on a Government Motion, and I am pleased that the Opposition have returned the compliment by choosing this as one of the Estimates debates subjects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Highland Transport Report made a number of recommendations which were divided into two parts. The earlier ones were dealt with partly by the previous Government and partly by us. Of these 28 recommendations, 24 were accepted, One was not appropriate for Government action, one was rejected, and two are still under consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the 59 new recommendations which appeared in the Report which we debated on 20th July, 1967, I am glad to say that the Government have accepted 39, one is not a matter for the Government, eight have either been rejected or have been overtaken by other events and no longer apply, and 11 are under consideration. In two years that is quite good going.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Gordon Campbell) mentioned one, and I would like to mention a number, but time restricts me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In reply to his point about the line of the road to the north of Inverness, in the context of the Invergordon smelter project, the Secretary of State, in consultation with the County Councils of Ross and Cromarty, and Inverness, has put in hand studies and surveys for the reconstruction of the A.9 between Inverness and Dingwall. The Government have no preconceived idea of the best solution. The Holmes Group report recommended that the Black Isle should be left for agriculture and amenity. That is a deliberate choice of the Holmes Group, and would argue against there being a road running across the Black Isle, but we have no preconceived notions. The Holmes Group was commissioned by the Highlands and Islands Development Board and its report is a useful pointer but is not a declaration of policy. If these studies of that part of A.9 suggest a crossing of The Dornoch Firth might profitably be investigated, the Government might consider that at the appropriate time. I look forward to hearing my hon. Friend the Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Mr. Maclennan)
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>162</span>
to find out whether Sutherland County Council has appointed consultants—at little cost to itself. It could give us useful information. In the light of the longer view of the A.9 we will look at this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like the Highland Transport Board, the Government believe that the transport requirements of the future call for a much broader co-ordination of the planning, development and operation of transport in the Highlands and Islands. It was for this purpose, and in relation to the needs of Scotland as a whole, that the Government, earlier this year, set up the Scottish Transport Group under the Transport Act, 1968.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The establishment of this Group is a step of the greatest significance and importance for the future development of Highland transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As hon. Members will be aware, the Transport Act transferred to the new Group the whole of the interests in Scottish road, passenger, and sea transport services formerly owned by the British Railways Board and by the Transport Holding Company. In Highland terms, this includes the full ownership and control of Highland Omnibuses Limited, and of the other two Scottish Bus Group companies Alexanders (Northern) Limited and Alexanders (Midland) Limited, which operate services in the Highland area, and of the Kyle to Kyleakin ferry. In addition, the Group acquired at the outset the 50 per cent. interest in MacBrayne's shipping and bus services formerly owned by the Transport Holding Company. This was immediately recognised by the appointment of two members of the Scottish Transport Group to the Board of MacBrayne's.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From the beginning, however, the Government and the Scottish Transport Group have been firmly of the view that the development of MacBrayne's sea transport services to meet modern needs and conditions, and the need to coordinate these effectively with the road passenger transport services, was a vital element in their task. They have, therefore, felt that advantage would lie in the Group acquiring the complete ownership and control of MacBrayne's through the purchase of the 50 per cent. shareholding owned by Coast Lines Limited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am very glad indeed to be able to inform the Committee that negotiations to this end between the Group and Coast Lines have just been successfully concluded.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0297">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>163</span>
This will help us enormously to get on with the modernisation and rationalisation of the fleet owned by the Scottish Transport Group. By bringing virtually the whole of the Highland road passenger transport services and the scheduled shipping services to the Western Isles for the first time under unified management we have the opportunity to give a new comprehensive look at the whole pattern of surface transport. The Chairman and managing director of the Scottish Transport Group, who have already made a number of visits to the Highlands and Islands, are anxious to tackle the problems without delay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One fact which is already clear and to which the Scottish Transport Group attaches great importance is that the old dependence on shipping services to the Islands on general-purpose ships is changing, and giving way to a need for new roll-on roll-off ferries capable of dealing with the increasing volume of private cars and goods transported by road. This is why, as recommended by the Highland Transport Board, MacBrayne's have already undertaken, in conjunction with a leading firm of naval architects, studies to determine the most suitable design for small vehicle ferries which the Highland Transport Board recommended should be introduced on a number of short-haul routes to replace the present conventional MacBrayne services. These studies, and the subsequent tank testing of models, have now been completed and the results in terms of specific design details are now being examined—quite properly—by the local authorities concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me instance also the new roll-on roll-off ferry which MacBrayne's have ordered from the Aailsa Shipbuilding Company at Troon in order to provide a modern and effective service to Islay and Colonsay, in conjunction with subsidiary services to Gigha and Jura, which in the Government's view will offer the islands a more satisfactory, reliable and comfortable service in all weathers than any which they have had so far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>164</span>
In dealing with the question of the takeover of Coast Lines 50 per cent. shareholding could he say in what way the Coast Lines holding was a hindrance to MacBrayne's?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May we have an assurance that in all this important work the Board of Trade Export Department will be kept informed? There will be export potential.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may say so, that is a good comment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the other comment, it is true that when one has a unified management one can get on better with a situation than where there are conflicting situations. MacBrayne's have primarily been responsible to the Government, while Coast Lines is a commercial firm which must properly be answerable to its shareholders. It is surprising to me to find that the hon. Gentleman is in favour of disunited management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further north, at Kyle of Lochalsh, the Scottish Transport Group, as the new owners of the Kyle Ferry, is taking delivery this year of an additional nine-car vessel and proposes to introduce a new and much larger vessel on the service next year. I am sorry to hear the comment of Lord Macdonald. I do not understand this, but I will look into it. I do not know whether it is in connection with this or some other matter, but without further information I cannot reply to the comment made by the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These steps should achieve substantial improvement in the capability of the ferry to accommodate a steadily growing volume of traffic en route to Skye or to Lewis and Harris via the Uig ferry, especially at the peak summer weekends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly the North of Scotland Shipping Company has now told us that it is ready to proceed with the introduction of a roll-on roll-off ferry across the Pentland Firth, following the study recommended by the Highland Transport Board, to replace the present service by the St. Ola from Scrabster.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is at present more than one view in Orkney as to the most desirable route the new vessel should take, and as the capital investment in terms of the ship and the new terminal facilities which will be needed is high we have felt it important to ensure that a comprehensive study is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0298">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>165</span>
made of the marine, engineering and other aspects of the choice of route before a final decision is taken. The Secretary of State has, therefore, asked the Highlands and Islands Development Board to take the lead in such a study in co-operation with the shipping company, and with the local and harbour authorities concerned, and to put forward recommendations. My hon. Friend the Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Mr. Maclennan) will be interested in this point. This study is well under way and its conclusions should be available in the near future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also glad to tell the Committee that, this week, the Orkney Islands Shipping Company has introduced on its services to the North Isles the new motor cargo vessel which is to replace the "Earl Sigurd". The new vessel, named "Islander", which has been specially designed to suit container traffic and to speed up cargo handling generally, has been acquired by the Company with the aid of a loan from the Secretary of State under the Highlands and Islands Shipping Service Act, 1960.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With reference to the comment made by the hon. Gentleman about publicity, I have here a copy of 	<i>The Orcadian</i> of 3rd July, in which I think he will agree that the company and the Government have done reasonably well in putting over the publicity. At the bottom of the page there is an advertisement by Loganair Limited which shows the good sense of private enterprise. Here is a good combination of public and private enterprise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another matter which the Highland Transport Board regarded as of great importance was the support of rural bus and ferry services, and the part to be played by local authorities in this. In the Transport Act, 1968, we have taken powers to give grant aid towards expenditure incurred by local authorities in initiating and supporting such services. These powers are, of course, in addition to those which remain available under the Congested Districts (Scotland) Act, 1897, to assist local authorities with the often heavy cost of building or improving piers or other terminals required. We are discussing a detailed circular on the way in which the new grants will be operated with the Scottish local authority Associations. When we have their comments we shall send this circular to all individual authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me turn now to the road programme in the crofter counties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>166</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. M. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend continues I should like to ask whether he has been conscious of pressure in regard to any other projects of this type from county councils, particularly demands for assistance in regard to individual ferries in Inverness County Council's outer islands?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Without being partisan I think a great deal of the bad Press which was given to the Transport Bill last year—and I agree with my hon. Friend that it was for political purposes—has tended to make people feel that there is something wrong with these projects. In fact they are good ones. They were recommended in the Report and they were endorsed in the debate in 1967. I feel that there is a suspicion on the part of county councils, but, like my hon. Friend, I hope they will be fair-minded, will look at the circular, and will decide whether or not this can be of use to them, as, indeed, I feel it will be in quite a number of cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was pleased that the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn restrained himself and did not go into a general economic debate. I shall not pursue that matter, either. But if we turn to the road programme in the crofting counties it is remarkable that this Government, with all their difficulties, are able to sustain such a high investment programme. In the five years 1964-1965 to 1968-1969 Government expenditure on the construction and improvement of roads in the Highlands and Islands amounted to £17.4 million—virtually double the figure for the previous five years. The Government hope that our 1965 White Paper programme will be completed by 1973. Between now and then, the level of investment in the improvement of Highland trunk and principal roads should continue at more than £3.5 million a year. In our second White Paper relating to roads—"Scottish Roads in the 1970s" Command 3953—there is also provision for substantial expenditure on trunk and principal roads during the succeeding decade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to mention everything that is being done, but I can only refer to a few schemes in which there is considerable public interest. The hon. Gentleman has mentioned one or two and I will try to comment on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the Oban-Lochgilphead trunk road A. 816, which is being reconstructed by a series of schemes, the two and a half miles
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0299">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>167</span>
between Ballinoe and Kilninver have just been completed, the Kilninver Diversion, one and a quarter miles, is now being built, and continuation of the series in the 1970s is planned. On the Inverness-Nairn road (A.96) the Stoneyfield Diversion, covering the worst one and a half miles, has just been completed, and we plan to reconstruct the rest of the road under the 1970s programme. The improvement of four miles of the Garve-Ullapool road A.835, centred on Braemore Lodge, is about to start and a further five miles north of Gorstan is programmed to follow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards principal roads, a seven and a half mile by-pass of Strome Ferry is being built along the south side of Loch Carron at an estimated cost of almost £600,000. I hope the hon. Gentleman will see signs of that construction going on, and I wish him a good holiday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman referred to the A.9 and to other routes leading into the Highlands.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would be delighted to make comments but unfortunately time restricts me. All I will say is this—and I may have to return to this at the end of the debate if the Committee will allow me—if hon. Members will look at paragraph 11 on page 6 they will see it indicates what is proposed to be done as well as what has already been done. What I want to do at the moment is to comment on very important issues which are, perhaps, not so widely known, although, of course, those roads are also important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman is replying to me perhaps I may just ask one question.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alasdair Mackenzie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may intervene here, I have been keeping in touch with this project and I am happy to say that the timetable at the moment indicates the summer of 1970, and the progress being made is very good.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not like the hon. Member for Ross and Cromarty (Mr. Alasdair Mackenzie) to be taken officially as the authoritative source. Officially the road should be completed at the end of next year, but knowing how lucky we have been in previous years with good weather and excellent contractors, and how well they work in the Highlands, we might well manage to meet his timetable. Personally I am very pleased that when I was Under-Secretary of State I was able to take such an active part with the hon. Gentleman and some others in dealing with this difficult problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Cairngorms, the improvement of the last two and a half miles of the 10 miles access road from Aviemore, including new bridges over the River Spey and the Inverness railway, will be completed this autumn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government intend to find an early place in the 1970s for the building of a bridge across the narrows at Ballachulish, A.82, detailed technical preparatory work for which is now being done by consulting engineers appointed by the Secretary of State. This scheme will cost something over £1 million, but as a bridge over this part of Loch Leven can by no means be called a major estuarial crossing, the Government are pleased to announce that the Ballachulish bridge will not be subject to tolls.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our proposals also include an early relief road at Fort William estimated to cost £1½ million, and, in association with an improvement of the main road between Inverness and Invergordon, the line of which has not yet been determined, but which may cost as much as £3 million, a by-pass of Inverness, at an estimated cost of £1 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A very important consideration in the future development of transport to the Islands is the question of shipping charges. The Government recognise that the level and pattern of charges is a matter of great importance to the island communities, and that there are several differing views as to the way subsidies should be paid or charges should be fixed. These include straight deficit financing; or charging on the basis of mainland comparisons as suggested by the Highland Transport board and by the Orkney and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0300">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>169</span>
Shetland County Councils; or the payment of Government grants towards the capital cost of ships; or the system being advocated by the Highlands and Islands Development Board which would regard sea crossings as extensions of mainland roads. While neither this Government nor the previous one have accepted that the island communities could or should be entirely insulated from increases which occur in the actual cost of providing transport facilities to those communities, we do not take the view that the system of charging and of deficit financing now in operation in respect of MacBryane's is necessarily the right one. The Government are, therefore, working with Scottish Transport Group as principal operator of shipping services to the Western Isles, and, of course, with the Highlands and Islands Development Board, to find the best way of dealing with this problem. Accordingly, I shall be meeting the Chairman of the Board, Sir Robert Grieve, with some of his colleagues, next Tuesday to discuss this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The future of air services to the Highland and Islands is also important. I look forward to hearing the comments of the Committee this morning on the Edwards Report which we are studying. Hon. Gentlemen will know that this matter was debated in considerable detail in another place and a number of useful suggestions were put forward. Like the Government Chief Whip in another place, we cannot, of course, promise a White Paper before the end of the summer, but certainly we would like to hear hon. Members' comments before that White Paper is prepared.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to pay tribute to the Army for the help it has given under the Opmac—Operation Military Aid to the Community—scheme in the construction of new air strips. These have already been built at Unst, Coll, Colonsay and Oronsay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Transport is critical to the future prosperity of the Highlands and Islands. I have attempted to give only a short introduction to this debate because of pressure of time, but I hope I may get a further opportunity of replying at the end, particularly to some of the points raised on rail transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only road haulage provision of the Transport Act which has been implemented
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>170</span>
so far has had the effect of "setting the people free"—I think that is the right phrase. The users of about 90,000 road haulage vehicles in Scotland have been freed from a licensing system which the party opposite operated, with us, for a large number of years. We are considering the position of quality licensing, which is very important, although perhaps not so contentious a party issue. We have made clear time and time again that the only time quantity licensing on a United Kingdom scale could be permitted would be when the rail freightliner services are fully effective and have been fully measured.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would counsel hon. Members to consider that there is a great deal of sound sense in what was said by the hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Mr. Maclennan) in his intervention. There is a great deal of misapprehension, not so much among people in the Highlands, who are longer in the tooth than some people give them credit for, but among people who might want to come to the Highlands. Not all that is said in the Press and by some hon. Gentlemen is true, namely, that there are incredible bureaucratic delays because of a system which, we know, is not in operation. I put that forward as a fair Scottish point. We must not exaggerate the position of quantity licensing, because to do so could cause immense harm to the development of the Highlands. This Government have done and are doing a great deal for the area, and we are determined to provide for the Highlands and Islands a comprehensive transport system which will effectively meet the needs of the people and the industries on which their livelihoods depend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with great interest to the speech of the Minister of State and I agree, of course, as is inevitable, with a certain amount of it. I wish to pick up one or two points which I believe are most important in the Highlands and one or two which are important for my own constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have often argued in the House and in this Committee that in thinking in terms of transport—and we all know that transport is vital to Scotland and particularly to the Highlands—there are two competing items about which we have to think. The first is the cost of transport, the second is speed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0301">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>171</span>
Broadly speaking, to generalise, in the south of Scotland, certainly from the industrial point of view, the more important of these two is speed. In the north, whilst speed of transport is important for certain areas, probably the biggest need there is for cheapness, because of the real difficulty of maintaining Highland populations if the cost of living in the area is noticeably above what it is in other areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I do not want in any way to widen the scope of debate to other matters, there is a very strong feeling indeed in the Highlands that the Government, who, as the Minister says, have done some good things in this field, have more than balanced this by the very large increases in transport costs which have occurred during these past five years. I do not think I need develop those, for everyone knows exactly what they are. They were a direct result of Government choice and they have had a very serious effect in increasing the cost of living in the Highlands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On road problems, I have always maintained—though it has not always been popular in my own constituency—that Highland roads are remarkably good considering the enormous length of road in the Highlands and the scattered nature of the population; and I believe all Governments have done a remarkable job of work in trying to improve them. I do not take much point from the Minister's argument that over the last five years he has spent more money than we spent in the previous five years. What he is saying, in fact, is that he has not actually stopped any of the programmes which were already laid down when he came to office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh, no.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister shakes his head, but he knows perfectly well these transport plans are a rolling five-year programme. He very kindly opened a road in my constituency and in doing so he said, "Have not we done splendidly?" But I authorised that road five years ago. I am not making a party point, but the fact is that all Governments, and rightly, have been and are trying to improve roads in the Highlands and, broadly speaking, have done a good job of work;
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>172</span>
and I do not believe there is any particular party point to be made by the Minister saying he has spent more than we did.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Within this complex of roads mention has been made of the roads to Stirling; and my hon. Friend mentioned the A.9. I am hoping that in his winding up the Minister will mention something he did not comment on in his speech, the programme for a Loch Lomond road, because this is a key link for the west of Scotland. It is a road which is not by any conceivable description up to date for carrying comparatively heavy industrial traffic throughout the year and very heavy tourist traffic in the summer. I very much hope he will tell us what is to happen there.

I am glad the Minister is studying Ballachulish, which, like other parts of the Highlands, has very nearly been studied long enough. There have been endless studies into what kind of bridge should be built and how it should be built; and I was hopeful that he would say that something was actually happening. If I

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be that the hon.

But if the bridge is now agreed, is being designed and is to be built, as a firm commitment, I am delighted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to speak now on a problem which is very real in my particular constituency, and topical, and that is the question of ferries. This is an exceedingly difficult problem. The Minister and I have discussed it over a number of years. We have had public and private discussions. The Highland Transport Board studied the whole problem of sea services between the islands of Islay, Jura, Gigha, Colonsay and the mainland, and supported what was known, broadly speaking, as the overland route. The Higlands Development Board, which took over the functions of the Highland Transport Board in this regard, also came to these islands and studied the problem carefully and again recommended a scheme broadly of the overland route type. The Secretary of State ignored both these and came out with a scheme which was broadly that produced by MacBrayne. The costing of this scheme was of the order of £1 million more than a comparable, and I believe satisfactory, scheme, which was put forward by a private enterprise firm, Western Ferries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>174</span>
I know of the complications and difficulties inherent in having two schemes, one produced by private enterprise and one sponsored by MacBrayne's. I know and appreciate the problems which the Government had in trying to make up their mind how best to operate one or both; because it is inevitable, unless there is to be Government intervention on a much greater scale than in the past, that the two schemes are going to operate simultaneously. I am perfectly certain in my own mind that, certainly if fair competition is allowed to develop, both schemes will probably suffer to some extent; but if the competition is to be unfair—and I have had had some correspondence with the Minister about this—then the whole community is going to suffer, because inevitably there will be a large deficit in some shape or form in order to support the less efficient of the two services. Therefore, there is a real problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been many different phases of the whole problem, but the Scottish Office has reconsidered a number of things and I understand is now changing the original Macbrayne's concept into something slightly different. One knows perfectly well that when changing one's mind one cannot always say exactly what is going to happen, but the situation today is more than usually bad because the Government have not yet decided—or, if they have, they have not announced it—what is to be the cost of any works based on any tenders, because tenders have not gone out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cost of the ship is probably the one thing which is firm. Considerable modifications were necessary to the first ship, but we now know what it is to cost. But we do not know what the piers are to cost, and whether any piers or works will be necessary over and above the single pier on West Loch Tarbert. We have not been told anything about what services are to be made available for Gigha or other islands. We have not been told anything about extra works or extra costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All we know is that MacBrayne's, in conjunction with the Government, are going to produce a scheme—perhaps it is good, perhaps it is not; but we do not know what share the taxpayer or the local
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0303">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>175</span>
authorities may have to put forward. This is not a very satisfactory situation after something like three years of careful consultation, and after all the independent people who have looked at this scheme have recommended exactly the opposite of what the Government are doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has said that the Government are considering changes in the method of charging for shipping services. I do not disagree that the present system is not satisfactory, and I am sure that the right hon. Member the Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Grimond), also, will not disagree. But I hope that when the Minister's consultations have been completed he will publish some information, so that we, as the people representing the communities in the Highlands, may have a chance of clearly expressing our thoughts about them to the Government. Our constituents are very much affected by these operations, and it is not unfair to ask the Minister to tell us what he is thinking of doing before he decides to do it, so that, at least, we may be consulted and can say something about it. It is in this context that I should like the Minister to publish a White Paper, or to make a really comprehensive statement, on the whole question of the shipping services to my group of islands, so that everybody can study the costs and can know exactly what is happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think any of us are at all politically biased about this, but we want to know what sort of value we are getting for money. That was the main purpose for which the Highlands Transport Board was originally set up, and I hope that it is also the purpose of the Highlands and Islands Development Board. But when I talk to the Board about this problem, it is in just as much sheer ignorance of the costs of the scheme which the Minister has approved as I am. So that nobody is in a position to say that the Government have made the right decision for the right reasons, and that the costs are going to be so much, although this is vital. If one is going to get down seriously to the key problem in the Islands, of providing a good service at the right price, the first task must be to see that the capital cost of the scheme bears some relation to the whole operation, because if the capital cost is going to be properly paid off it is going to affect the cost of the services themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>176</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why did not the right hon. Gentleman do this when he had the power to do it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that remark, because what we did was to set up the Highlands Transport Board to study this particular problem, and a series of others in the Highlands, and to advise upon the best thing to do. They did it quickly and they did it right. The Minister overturned that, and then the Highlands and Islands Development Board looked at the subject and agreed with our concept, which the Highlands Transport Board had recommended. The Minister then overturned that, too. That is the answer to the hon. Gentleman about why we did not do it. We wanted to get the best advice and it should have been taken. Now that the Minister is going ahead with his own variant of the scheme, I ask that we should have the full facts and figures about costs presented to us, so that we can judge the Minister's decision and make up our minds whether it is right or wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that Western Ferries is operating, and that the Minister is going to get an invitation tomorrow or shortly after to look at the new boat which they have produced. The Minister may think this very funny, although I do not see why. It is a new boat which the Minister and his Office said could not be built at the estimated cost, and could not be built on time. But it has been built at that cost and it is going to be delivered on time, and I hope that the Minister will come and see it. I shall see it, as I think it is interesting. It is a new development, and I want to see how it is going to operate. Obviously, the Minister regards this as something rather curious and odd. I remember his often coming to look at new hovercraft and things of that sort, because they are interesting and valuable, and I hope that he will not just laugh when he is asked to look at any development in the Highlands, even if it is a little embarrassing to his own ideas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have taken up more time than I intended. I hope that, in this very important business of transport in the Highlands, the Minister will not only consult his own people or the Transport Group—who, I am sure, will be an excellent body of people, but they are not the only people who understand Highlands transport problems—but will take this Committee and Members of Parliament for

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>177</span>
the Highland areas more regularly and more deeply into consultations than he has done in the past.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is, perhaps, interesting for the Committee to contrast the approach to Highlands transport of an ex-Secretary of State with a shadow Secretary of State. I think the Committee must have been disappointed with the speech of the shadow Secretary of State, since he was non-committal in his approach to this subject. He acknowledged once in the course of his speech, when he was dealing with the approach road to the Highlands, that in considering transport problems one had to take priorities into account; but at no point did he tell us what his own priorities would be, or what they are at the present time. The contrast with the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) was striking. He started his speech with a bold assertion, with which many would agree, that the priority should be cheapness rather than speed. So at least, as always, with the right hon. Member for Argyll we know where are are What a contrast that was to the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Gordon Campbell) who, in his peripatetic journies around the Highlands, leads all to believe that their road is the most important road, and that if his Government is elected to office—and heaven portend that it should ever be so—that road will be given priority. He took about 10 minutes of his speech in dealing with two projects within my own constituency, the Dornoch ferry crossing and the Pentland Firth crossing, but he was not prepared to say whether he thought either was a good idea. I hope to make my views clear on both of those projects. But it is utterly deplorable that the principal spokesman of the Opposition should come before this Committee today and speak in this parish pump way, supporting a little project here and another one there, with a penny-pinching approach to priorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Above all, it is quite extraordinary that he should have devoted so little attention to the Government's recent White Paper on Scottish roads in the 1970s, because, in a nutshell, it is this which poses the problem of Highlands transportation. I think that the approach of the White Paper is understandable, but wrong. The emphasis on the development of principal roads is understandable in the context of the Central Belt and the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>178</span>
industrial areas of Scotland, but it cannot be right for those under-developed parts of Scotland which are so dependent upon having their trunk roads improved, to enable the manufactured products of those areas, the agricultural products and the fishing products, to have access to the markets of the south. I take that as the framework of my approach to what has been done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before going into schemes in which I have a constituency interest, and which it is quite reasonable for me to spend some time on, though I should have looked for a different approach from the principal Opposition spokesman, though I should have welcomed his support, had it been forthcoming, for any of these schemes—before turning to those specific points I should like to mention one or two of this Government's considerable achievements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unlike the right hon. Member for Argyll I cannot so lightly pass over the massive increase, the doubling of public expenditure on roads in the Highlands of Scotland, the effect of which is noticeable wherever one goes. In particular, I should like to welcome an authorised improvement under the crofters county programme in my own constituency, for which I have been pressing for years and which the Government have agreed. I refer to the construction of the bridge across the Kyle of Tongue. It is a most sensible decision which will have a valuable effect in opening up the north coast, and, in particular, helping the community of Melness. There are other schemes in my constituency which are going ahead with commendable speed. There has been the development of the Skiay Bridge and Loch Assynt Road, which is a stretch of four miles of great importance to the fishing industry of Lochinver. Again, this is a matter on which I have been pressing the Government for some years, and I am delighted with the progress being made. I hope that that road will be completed all the way to Lochinver pier, so that the expanding fleet there can take full advantage of this improvement. Also, we have seen work on the Laxford Bridge and Clashfearn road, and we have seen roughly six and a half miles of the Lairg and Muie road under construction, and these are major developments under this scheme. Also, and not in my constituency, we have seen the removal of a very bad bottle-neck which
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0305">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>179</span>
has interrupted traffic north of Inverness at Conon Bridge, and that is a most excellent outcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to the different schemes for road building, I would start with the trunk road scheme, where I find the White Paper on roads in the 1970s most unsatisfactory in its approach to the roads north of Inverness. I fully acknowledge that the Government are undertaking a proper study of the stretch of road to Invergordon, and this commitment to develop that road is of considerable importance not only to the Moray Firth area, narrowly conceived, but also to the whole of Scotland north of Inverness. What gives rise to my anxieties is the rather spotty proposals for patching up and removing bends, and straightening curves and avoiding traffic bottlenecks. The map is not entirely clear, but it appears to include the improvements at Helmsdale, in the Dunbeath area and at Bonar Bridge, which are virtually completed, though I would draw the Minister's attention to the urgent need to study the question of replacement of the Bonar Bridge itself, connecting the two counties of Ross and Cromarty and Sutherland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But it is to the proposal for the crossing of the Dornoch Firth that I should like to draw my hon. Friend's attention. He knows, from correspondence that we have had on this subject over many months, of my interest in this question and of my view that it is right to build that bridge in the context of the developments which are taking place in the Moray Firth area. I welcomed what he had to say this morning about his willingness to initiate studies into this question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In reply to what my hon. Friend said about the willingness of the Sutherland County Council to carry out its own feasibility survey, all I am able to say on this occasion is that the Sutherland County Council has discussed this question and references have been made to the possibility of two firms carrying out these studies for a reasonable price. But my best endeavours have failed to elicit from the County Council the names of these firms, although I have written on two occasions. It is not, therefore, with any great confidence that I can assure the Minister that Sutherland County Council
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>180</span>
is doing all it can in this matter. I hope he will make good any deficiencies which there may be in this matter of the local authority. I know that the local authority—and I pay tribute to it here—is extremely concerned to have this bridge built. And I think it will certainly back up the Minister in any way it can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I received a letter from the County Clerk at Caithness reaffirming the interest of the Caithness County Council in this project also. It would clearly be of benefit to the whole north area to have this bridge go ahead. The Minister was good enough to assure me in a letter written two years ago that if there should be a massive increase of industry in Iver-gordon the Dornoch ferry crossing would be a new one. The situation has arisen, and I think the time has come for thorough re-examination of this proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning from trunk road schemes to the crofter counties programme under which a number of lesser roads are improved, here the Government have a first-class record of maintaining expenditure of about £2 million per annum, and the evidence of this expenditure is obvious for all to see. The improvement of roads under the Congested Districts (Scotland) Act, 1897, has proved enormously valuable in the Highlands although it has always remained a mystery to me why this Act was so entitled since any less congested part of the country than the Highlands would be hard to imagine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. M. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was congested from the landlords' point of view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There has been some criticism of the operation of this Act in my constituency in particular with regard to the definition of a crofting township. It will be obvious to my hon. Friend that the character and pattern of agriculture in the crofting areas is changing rapidly, and in a number of cases crofters have moved out of the croft houses in the township although the crofts are still worked. The fact that the grants are available under this Act only when more than one house is being served—as I understand it, this is the interpretation presently put on the Act by the Minister—does not mean that the roads to the crofts are any less important from an agricultural point of view. I would ask the Minister to consider again whether or not the Act is being interpreted too restrictedly,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0306">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>181</span>
particularly in view of the fact that in Caithness at least—and this may be the position in other parts of the Highlands—it has not proved possible for that authority to take up all that has been allocated to it for the improvement of roads to crofting townships.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are a number of small roads which are of great importance from a tourist point of view and some of these roads cannot look for improvement under the crofter county scheme or under the Congested Districts (Scotland) Act, and it is therefore with particular pleasure that I acknowledge the important possibilities which have been opened up by the establishment of the Countryside Commission in Scotland with powers to give finance to roads which would not otherwise be eligible for central Government grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can think of a number of roads in my constituency that could stand to benefit from the operation of this scheme. In particular one brought to my hon. Friend's attention is the road to Sandside Harbour. I believe there are roads round the Stoer Peninsula area where a grant from the Countryside Commission might be the best approach to improving what are becoming increasingly attractive roads to tourists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would not like the occasion to pass without paying tribute to the work of the Army in Opmac and the construction of an airfield at Unst and the road in Strontian. Valuable work has been done, and I look forward to the further assistance of the Army in my own constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would have liked to have asked another question, but I am not sure that it falls strictly within the terms of this debate, although there are references in the Highland Board's Report and the Scottish Development Department's Report to the proposals the Government have for developing the minibus services throughout the Highland areas in place of the mail van services. This has given rise to some speculation, particularly on the part of those who are at present engaged in the difficult task of trying to operate these services commercially.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning from roads to the question of rail transport, here the position is even more disturbing north of Inverness, for reasons which will be obvious to all. One simply has to look at the figures which now make plain, as a consequence of the Transport Act, the extent to which these lines in the Highlands are being subsidised.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>182</span>
The Wick to Thurso to Inverness line is being subsidised to the extent of £594,000 per annum. That in itself must put a question mark over the future of that line, and I hope that my hon. Friend will be able to give a clear assurance that this line will be subsidised to enable it to continue operations both in freight and passenger carriage. I believe that as things stand at present it is the lifeline of the northern Highlands, and as there can be no prospect of major road improvements if this White Paper is to be carried through in its present form, of a kind which would make the roads north of Inverness comparable to some of the major trunk roads in the centre of Scotland, it is all the more important that this line be maintained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason why there has been so much anxiety about this, and Questions being asked in the House of Lords and answered by my noble Friend Lord Hughes, is that there have been a number of actions taken by British Rail in restricting services north of Inverness, ostensibly, at least, for economy reasons, but which it is feared may lead to diminished use of that line: actions such as the alteration of the early morning timetable which make it an extremely unattractive train; actions such as the removal of freight depots in Helmsdale and Golspie; actions such as the failure to improve the facilities of the Golspie station—although there has been improvement or promise of improvement here, there is still no clear policy on this, and we are proceeding on a year to year basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not one of the lines given a three-year subsidy, and unless that kind of decision is made to put this line on a proper long-term subsidy basis these anxieties will remain. I take the view that this is a most important question in establishing business confidence. If one is going to have industrial or any other kind of development one must have assurances about transport. I fully appreciate the reason why it was not possible to give assurances of that kind, for every line in Scotland had to be considered consequent upon the Transport Act, 1968, and it was necessary to phase the examination of these lines, but we must now have a firm commitment on this as soon as possible, and I hope my hon. Friend will urge his right hon. Friend the Minister of Transport to deal with this matter with the urgency with which it should be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0307">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>183</span>
Sea transport is not a matter which closely affects my constituency, but I feel that the full potential of Scrabster as a port on the north Atlantic route has not been properly examined. This is not entirely pie in the sky, and deserves further thought by both the Highland Development Board, and, after that, by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, air transport, which is of vital importance. Here we have had a number of important reports since the Committee last had the opportunity of debating transport in the Highlands. In particular we have had the report of the Edwards Committee which took account of the representations which had been made by the Highlands and Islands Development Board suggesting that a proper, viable transport service was quite possible in the Highlands area provided the uneconomic Viscount services were restricted and services of lighter aircraft fed in. This is a most important proposal, both in itself and for the economy of B.E.A., and we must all agree that the time has come for a proper subsidisation of these uneconomic but vital routes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from that consideration, as I see it there are real possibilities of expanding the air services throughout the Highland area if we have some different kind of aircraft and new airstrips can be opened up. We have one in my constituency at Dornoch in which there is great interest in development and in which I believe there are possibilities. There are possibilities of using the airstrip at Dounreay. I would draw my hon. Friend's attention to the fact that in an answer I received from his hon. Friend the Minister of State at the Board of Trade attention was drawn to the number of flights scheduled from Wick airport which were cancelled due to bad weather: 10.3 per cent. of the flights to Wick airport were cancelled in the course of last year, 8.3 per cent. being due to bad weather.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend not agree that airport services really do have a priority? When it comes to establishing automatic ground-landing equipment, B.E.A. have invested £7 million on automatic equipment, and Scottish airports which suffer from low cloud have a priority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that point, but it is a matter for consideration whether it
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>184</span>
will be more costly to operate than a feeder service at Dounreay itself. This is a problem which must be answered and can be answered in the way the hon. Gentleman has suggested.

Before calling the next speaker I should just like to point out that it has been possible to call only four Members of the Committee this morning, and I suggest to the Committee that it would be in their interests carefully to consider the time taken up by speakers this morning. It is not, I believe, in the interests or according to the wish of the Committee that the timing should be as it has been this morning. I am very sorry, but it will not be possible to call all those who wish to speak.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. J. Grimond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully appreciate your sentiments, Miss Harvie Anderson. There are many important matters under consideration. I shall confine my remarks to major points. We have still to hear the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor), that important area which is at least congested if it is not crofting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many parts of the Highlands and Islands public money expended by way of grant has been more than offset by increased public charges of various sorts like the rise in fuel tax, Selective Employment Tax, some rates, and increased freight costs. It is essential, if we are to have an effective policy on Highlands and Islands Development that Government policy should move in the same direction and should centre on freight and transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State mentioned a new look at methods of assisting Highland transport. I do not object to that, but in Orkney and Shetland we have been envious of £600,000 in subsidies a year to MacBrayne's. It is not that we do not wish our friends in other parts to have that, but that we would also like it ourselves. We do not want new delay while the new policy is thought out, and it should be borne in mind that we are not the only people for whom transport is subsidised. The amount written off the British Railways accounts is enormous and the airlines and London Transport have been subsidised. We have a much better case for subsidy of transport for social purposes than many others who have long been assisted. There is also the question of the licences we pay. We pay the same fees on the Islands as they do on the mainland, and we do not get the same facilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Orkney and Shetland County Councils have submitted to the Secretary of State a joint memorandum in support
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>186</span>
of their plea for Exchequer subsidy. It begins by pointing out that freight costs have been rising at a rate 50 per cent. higher than has the cost of living. There have been seven increases in freight charges by sea in the last eight years, and it is interesting to see in submission I from the County Councils that, taking 1960 as a base year, with 100 as the figure, freight costs have gone up to 151; dock labour to 198; and retail prices to 134.6. But looking at the sources of income of the Islands the picture changes. Cattle prices have only gone up to 118 and sheep prices have decreased to 97. Egg prices have decreased to 75 and milk has gone up only to 114. That is some measure of the impact of freight charges on Highland communities. It has been pointed out by the Prices and Incomes Board and by the Highland Transport Board that the rate of increase is likely to increase. That is crucially basic to our well being.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The increases were referred to the Prices and Incomes Board, which did not deny their importance, but its recommendations were faulty in two respects. It seemed to expect that the islanders should provide all the help for themselves. Yet it is the general taxpayer, including Highlands and Islands residents with no rail services or trunk roads, who have to provide for all the rest of the subsidies. The main plank of the case for a subsidy rests on the particular difficulties of the islanders and the desirability of strengthening their economy and obtaining a better balance of population throughout Britain. It is as illogical to transfer the burden from one islander's pockets to another as it would be to lay the cost of slum clearance on the people who live in the slums. The Western Isles are rightly not asked to subsidise MacBrayne's. The other objection to the P.I.B. suggestion is that it does not seem to take into account the nature and capabilities of local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two County Councils—and this is something I have advocated for a long time—have set out clearly the principles upon which aid should be given, and they quote with approval the recommendations of the Highland Transport Board:
	<br><blockquote><p>"That for the purpose of deciding the need for subsidy to the shipping companies, the Secretary of State should adopt the criteria that the general level of charges to the islands should not be materially in excess of charges to distant parts of the mainland (e.g. Thurso). Whilst transport
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0309">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>187</span>
charges from Caithness to Central Scotland remain at their present level, this yardstick is hardly likely to impose an unreasonable burden on the Exchequer."</p></blockquote>
If the Minister of State likes to come down on some other criteria for help we would examine it, but the County Councils have made a serious study of this and have had expert advice. If the Minister of State thinks it is an unacceptable point of view will he tell us when he hopes to be able to give us some alternative? Otherwise it should be accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Councils go on to suggest a second criteria which is a comparison between the cost of living and the general cargo freight index. I will not go into detail on the cost, but the total would be about £180,000. This is 15½ per cent. on turnover, as compared with 29 per cent. subsidy to British Rail and 25 per cent. subsidy for MacBrayne's.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to the general submission, Shetland County Council has put in a separate plea for help to the North Islands of Shetland. It is not only the cost of the basic routes which are high but the onward freight charges for transmission to the outer islands. The cost of taking a ton of feed from Baltasonand to Lerwick is 53s. 4d. plus 16s. 8d. for handling and docking charges, while the charge from Aberdeen to Keigh is only 33s. 3d., while the rate when six tons are sent is only 23s. 11d. The distances are much the same. We are trying to develop Shetland. In Yell there are good prospects for knitwear and fish processing and throughout the islands fishing is expanding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In North and South Orkney the cost of transport is heavy, but the rebirth of the air services which we had long ago, by Loganair, is of immense benefit. There are few developments which have given greater satisfaction in a small way to these communities in recent years, but rate charges remain heavy. I hope this type of service can be extended to the Shetland Islands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put down a Question about extending air services round the islands of Shetland. Owing to a mistake, it was thought I referred to services between Orkney-Shetland. What I had in mind was a Loganair type service which should take in the Skerries, Foula, Fair Isle, Unst, Yell, Whalsay, etc. I accept that the question of the Pentland ferries is a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>188</span>
technical one which requires careful examination. I hear that the Government are undertaking that examination, and I will merely make one or two points. The Minister of State mentioned some of the people who would be investigating it and involved in it. I assume that Western ferries will be consulted as they are among the most expert people in this and we have heard of their success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are several views about the desirability of this matter and its effects on the economy and it would be desirable to consult the district councils. The main factors seem to me to be the availability of landing places about which there may be some difficulty. There is also the practicability of keeping a ship which would be heavily used in summer but not used so much in winter. I hope that the inquiry will be speeded up, and that it will be as expert as possible. The island of South Ronaldsay would like a short sea route with its enormous advantages for the tourist trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to say one last word about our links with the south. There is a grave suspicion that the railway line from Inverness to Wick is being run down to the stage when it will be possible to say that it is so little used that it can be closed. The trains run at times which suit no one and at speeds which would disgrace the last century. Very little effort is made to exploit this line. This is a grave threat to the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to the air services, which are of such great importance to my constituency, this is an area of transport which is constantly expanding, both in regard to passenger traffic and freight. Even now, with bigger aircraft and a few more services it is difficult at certain times to get a seat on an aircraft travelling to my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, I cannot myself get one for the week after next, nor can I get back from Shetland to Orkney at the times I want to in the month of August. These forms of transport are not only vital, but I agree with the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Aygyll (Mr. Noble) that probably the freight charges are a matter of top priority. There is also need for greater volume and greater speed in the transport services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0310">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>189</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a most useful and constructive debate, and I think the practical interest that we all take in Highland transport has been clear from the fact that almost every hon. Member, as he finished his speech, admitted that he had spoken for longer than he had intended. This is usually a sign of intense interest in a subject. Every speaker has admitted that transport plays a crucial role in maintaining the life and activity in the Highlands, and perhaps to an even greater extent in the Islands, as stated by my hon. Friend in his opening speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reasons for this were set out by my hon. Friend. First, the distance of the market from the industry, and also the length of the roads. It was interesting to see in the Report of the Highlands and Islands Development Board that 33 per cent. of the trunk roads in the whole of Scotland were within the Highland area, while 28 per cent. of expenditure on classified roads has been allocated to the Highland area. It is also interesting to note that in these areas, particularly in the Highlands, in industries such as forestry, agriculture, mining, quarrying, and so on, the actual total cost of transport is larger than in the other industries. My right hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) rightly emphasised that the question of speed was important and relevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been generally accepted and agreed that transport is perhaps the most important political issue in the Highlands, and the Government must give urgent attention to it. While some of my hon. Friends have supported this contention, it has evoked a certain opposition from hon. Members opposite, particularly the hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Mr. Maclennan), but I think, if the Government review fairly the state of affairs in regard to what they have been doing—and the Minister usually does this fairly—the hon. Gentleman will see that in regard to this Government in particular, if they had deliberately chosen the measures which would be most harmful to the Highlands and Islands generally, and in particular to their transport services, they could not have done it with greater accuracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had the most savage increase in taxation on road hauliers in recent years. For example, in 1964 the tax on the road users amounted to about £777 million, whereas this year it is estimated that it will be £1,600 million, which means
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>190</span>
that in the short period of five years the burdens on the road users have far more than doubled. If we consider the crucial importance of transport in the Highlands it must be clear beyond a shadow of doubt what a tremendous burden falls on industry in the Highlands. On top of this we have the additional burden of Selective Employment Tax and the effect this has on garages and repairs. In addition we have the Transport Act, which has been mentioned in such a defensive way by the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh, no. I am very proud of it. It was the first thing I boasted about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we consider the nonsense of some parts of that Act and the effect it will have on Highland transport, the Government have every reason to be ashamed of themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to paragraph 195 of the Report of the Highlands and Islands Development Board but he did not mention paragraph 190, which refers specifically to the increased costs which were in fact inherent in the Transport Act, and the Report mentions in fact that increased productivity is seen by the Government as the means by which road hauliers can absorb the extra costs implicit in the Transport Act, but in the Highlands and Islands any possibility of achieving increased productivity is either made very difficult, or ruled out altogether, by road conditions. Certainly I think it would be impossible for anyone to read this Report without recognising that the Highlands and Islands Development Board is very concerned indeed about some aspects of the Transport Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said, in a defensive kind of way, that more was being spent on Highland roads, and we welcome this, but, on the other hand, what is of great importance is the future. We are entitled to ask the Minister what are the plans of the Government in regard to future spending in the Highlands and Islands. The Board said in its Report that the 1970s must be a decade of rapid and substantial road improvement and development. It was mentioned in the previous Report of the Highland Transport Board that it was seriously concerned about the inadequacy of current programmes for a modern road system. There is an interesting table on page 94 of the Report which shows that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0311">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>191</span>
over the three years mentioned in that table, namely 1964-1967, in fact the increase was not there at all, and if we were to consider this in relation to real costs, it looks like a reduction. No provision has been made for increased expenditure on either trunk or classified roads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More interesting, if we look at the Civil Estimates for 1970 we find that reference to major schemes in the Highlands is almost non-existent. More important is the question of the progress that is made. In 1967-68 expenditure was estimated to be £38 million, whereas in 1968-69 it was expected to be about £35 million, and if we take the Civil Estimates as a guide, and take away shipping and public transport the figure is £37 million. Certainly a figure of about 5 per cent. per year in a time of inflation does not seem to be a major increase at all, and I wonder whether the Minister can tell us what plans the Government have for spending on the Highlands over the next few years, particularly bearing in mind the massive increase in taxation, which is particularly relevant so far as the Highlands are concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of priorities in regard to roads I think it would be wrong to lay down firm priorities. Certainly the road from Perth to Inverness must be regarded as a priority. Certain of these roads have been mentioned in every Report, and I wonder whether the Minister could give us any indication of his plans. It was interesting to read in the article by Mr. P. Hunter Gordon that he particularly mentioned that his first desire as an industrialist with a factory in Inverness was to have a good road capable of taking heavy and reasonably high loads between Inverness and the south. The Cairn-Cross Report and the Toothill Committee have both emphasised that first must come communications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certain specific matters have been raised. My hon. Friend raised the question of the road from Inverness to the north, which is vital, and the hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland spent a good deal of his speech in dealing with that. Everyone agrees that a shorter road is imperative and long overdue. Instead of making a dual carriageway from Inverness to Inver-gordon on the route of the present trunk road, as has been mentioned, I think consideration should be given to bridging the Beauly Firth at Kessock and crossing the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>192</span>
Black Isle via Tore to cross the Cromarty Firth by causeway just north of Evanton and thence to Invergordon. The trunk road should then cross the Dornoch Firth at Meikle Ferry just west of Dornoch. This route would take Thurso within 100 miles by road from Inverness, which is a reduction of over 20 per cent. but, more important, a car journey of about two hours as against the present three hours plus. It is very important, and it is good to know, that consideration is being given to this in a detailed way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reverting to the Transport Act, the Board made reference to this and said that as a rule the extra costs can be overcome, but this is virtually impossible in the Highlands. The Minister has said that we should not bother too much about this, but anyone wanting to travel or to send goods by road cannot estimate the cost on distance as the crow flies. The crow has special significance in the Highlands because it travels in a more direct way than most of the roads. When an industrialist wants to send goods he has to make special application and give particulars of the goods which are proposed to be carried, the persons for whom they are to be carried, and the circumstances under which they are to be carried. It is a long and exhaustive procedure. The procedures themselves are not the most relevant thing, but so far as the Highlands are concerned the question of return loads is vital when we are considering the rates of cost, because quite apart from the administrative nonsense of quantity licensing, which will apply just as much in the Highlands as anywhere else, easy access of return loads is crucial. I hope the Minister can give some guarantee that this will be applied in such a way that costs can be limited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland mentioned, as did the right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Grimond), the great uncertainty which exists over the railways in the north. In the discussions which some of us have had with the Minister of Transport it has been suggested that the reason why some grants were for one year, others for two years, and yet others for three years, was simply for administrative convenience, so that all the grants would not come up for renewal at one particular time. I wonder whether the Minister can give an assurance on this and indicate that no other special significance should be attached to it?
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0312">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>193</span>
As the right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland righty said, it sometimes appears in the north that the public undertakings almost seem to go out of their way to lose traffic. The train from Thurso which used to leave at 6 a.m. and which attracted quite a good deal of traffic has now had its departure time altered to 5.15 a.m. This has resulted in its being very little used. Also, the closing down of the freight facilities at Golspie and Helmsdale has created an atmosphere of great uncertainty, and that uncertainty should be removed as speedily as possible, in the interests of the Highlands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far as shipping is concerned, the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Orkney and Shetland dealt thoroughly and appropriately with the question of the shipping facilities in regard to his constituency and the Highland communities. The present level of shipping charges is rightly regarded in the Highlands as being crippling, and any suggestions of increases would not be welcome in any quarter. On the specific question raised by the right hon. Gentleman, it is rather unfortunate that when two Boards have gone into this question and have come forward with specific proposals, the Secretary of State should have overturned them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of air services, it is, of course, a matter of importance that the air services which are provided should be of the right type, and I think it is right that so many hon. Members, including my hon. Friend the Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Gordon Campbell), should have stressed the importance of using the smaller aircraft in areas where they can be used profitably, and to provide services which give benefit and reduce costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is almost impossible in a short period of time to do justice to the importance of the subject and all the very crucial issues raised, but one thing which must be stressed above all is that any Government who deliberately seek to increase the cost of transport in the Islands do a very great disservice to the Islands which cannot be overturned or changed in any way by little measures to increase bus grants or by trying to give a date for particular road projects and so on. What is desperately crucial is that transport costs should not
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>194</span>
increase. In this matter the Government have a shameful record. I hope that it is a record they will not have in the future, and that the plans they are laying down at the present time will undo some of the very great damage they have inflicted on Highlands and Islands transport by their policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The speech of the hon. Gentleman which was short and interesting has been to some extent answered by my earlier speech which was also short and I hope interesting—certainly the point about the Transport Act, which understandably interested the hon. Gentleman, because he spent a great deal of time on it. Unfortunately, some other hon. Members do not seem to enjoy the same knowledge of that Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Highlands and Islands the position is such that under quantity licensing special authorisations would not be opposed by British Rail and the National Freight Corporation unless on specific grounds. It was said in the Act that it was expected that the vast majority of any applications in the Highlands would be unopposed because British Railways would be unable, in terms of speed, reliability and cost, to offer a better alternative service than that provided by road hauliers in the Highlands. It is a knowledge of that that informs, not Hunter Gordon, but those in the Highlands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Hon. Gentlemen opposite may want to drum up some support, but they may do damaging things if they carry on in this way, because if the hon. Gentleman is kind enough to look up paragraph 192 of the Report of the Highlands and Islands Development Board, 1968, he will find the statement:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… if implemented without safeguards for the special circumstances of the Highlands and Islands …"</p></blockquote>
Some provisions of the Transport Act, 1968, might have increased operators' costs and charges. A little further on there is a reference to our late friend Stephen Swingler and the statement:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We made a number of representations to the Government about the measures which we thought would be inappropriate to the region and subsequently had discussions with the Minister of State for Transport."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>196</span>
Paragraph 193 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We shall keep a careful watch on events to ensure that maximum flexibility is maintained."</p></blockquote>
I gave that assurance, and what more can I do but say that it is unfair to complain about a system which has been discussed—not imposed, and which cannot be imposed till the freightliner system is seen to be working carefully and well?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would assure the right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Grimond) that I, too, welcome the joint approach in the meeting on 26th June between the S.T.G. and the County Councils of Orkney and Shetland. As a result of the meeting and memorandum we will send a reply to the Counties as soon as we can. In my opening remarks I referred to our search for the right system for subsidising shipping charges, and I am glad that both the right hon. Gentleman and the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) agree that this is a worthwhile exercise. For my part, I offered four possible ways of doing this, and there may be others. I would be very glad to hear anything further on this, because our discussions with the Highlands Board about the possible alternatives we could accept are very sincere and very deep. But I do not shy away from the fact that we have, in the meantime, to deal with existing conditions. With this in mind we offered the Orkney and Shetland counties assistance to the extent of £75,000 annually to help in the implementation of last year's Report of the Prices and Incomes Board. So far those counties have felt unable to accept this offer, and I am afraid that, as a result of rising operating costs, which the hon. Gentleman documented, the shipping company is having to contemplate a further increase in the near future in the charges on its main service between Orkney, Aberdeen and Shetland. This underlines the need for the company to bring forward proposals for investment in new ships, with the major operating economies these should bring, as soon as possible. We shall be very ready to discuss these matters with the company as a matter of importance and urgency. It is still open to the County Councils to accept the Government's offer of £75,000 as an annual grant till we are able to look at alternative systems and till we can resolve these complex matters in our meetings with the Highlands Board beginning on Tuesday next.

Turning to other points raised in the debate, the position with regard to the A.9 is very important. We are bringing the Motorway as far north as Perth, and if the Committee will look again at the White Paper, "Scottish Roads in the 1970s" they will see that we have itemised various parts of the programme as we see it. Essentially, it is a document for discussion and assessment but we have to programme it as we go along. In section 11 we talk of comprehensive appraisal of major trunk routes. We have built the Perth, Dunkeld, Pitlochry section which, with the Pitlochry-Inverness section, was raised in our debate two years ago as matters of concern. We must progress up the map of Scotland, and we are taking the Motorway as far as Perth and dealing with the by-pass there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend referred to the position affecting Caithness. He is concerned about the position of the A.9 at Inver-gordon and from Inverness to Invergordon. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) mentioned the attractiveness of building a certain line of road, but I would put it to him that there are more than just road considerations here. It is attractive to argue about the shortness of a road or making a particular new road and I would be surprised if the line of road which we put forward as the best would necessarily be that which would receive public approval, because these are matters of contention. Certainly, in the Black Isle, a very beautiful part of Scotland, this is a matter for consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would, therefore, counsel the Grand Committee not to jump at the shortest road as necessarily the best, for there may be other considerations which have to be evalued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Argyll said we had not given much information about costs of the Islay service. We tried to give a figure on 1st February, 1968. It was then about £1.1 million. Our present estimate, allowing for normal escalation of prices, is about £1.4 million. But that compares with a figure of £2 million which was assessed as the figure for the overland route, excluding the cost of the vessels which would, of course, make a difference. It is, therefore, a matter of judgment whether or not that should be done, as opposed to the proposition we put forward. The Government, in turn, have decided that this is the right way of proceeding.

As to ideas on the different kinds of ships, I myself am not a technical man but, with my advisers, I am very willing to see as much as I can of different kinds of ships, and if I am lucky enough to get an invitation to visit a new ship owned by any company, including Western Ferries, I shall be glad to do so. I am going to Islay and Jura in August and may be able to do so then. But let us not lose sight of the fact that in a State organisation we have to provide safe, reliable, regular and comfortable service all the year round, and we cannot just rely on an operator who may not be able, for sound reasons of profitability, to offer such a safe, regular, reliable and comfortable service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure the Minister appreciates, since we have discussed it before, that in all our discussions with Western Ferries it was made absolutely clear that if they ran this operation they would have to run it in exactly the same way as MacBrayne for reliability, all-weather operation, safety and so on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have discussed this matter with the County Councils, as the hon. Gentleman knows. The general feeling I had was that people were prepared to accept that MacBrayne did this and had done it, perhaps not as perfectly as they would wish; but they felt it was safer than a system which was at present on trial. But we are trying to reorganise the whole system through the Scottish Transport Group.

Finally, on the question of railways, the Minister of Transport has no proposals before him for the withdrawal of services from any Highland railway line, and I hope that any such speculation will be discounted by hon. Gentlemen who, as is their privilege, have access to the Minister. The hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Campbell) asked about the Kyle line. My right hon. Friend concerned will be paying British Railways £594,000 under the Transport Act to provide services on the Wick-Thurso line and £276,000 in the case of the Kyle line; and about £1 million is being paid for lines in the Highlands and Islands area and £1 million for lines leading to that area. In terms of population these are very substantial sums in proportion to what is given for the United Kingdom as a whole. We are involved in the

consideration of the future of these lines and in accordance with recommendation 732 of the Report of the Highland Transport Board we are looking to the future of the Kyle line when the A.87 Invergarry-Kyle road has been sufficiently improved. My hon. Friend the Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) may not be happy about that, but it is proper that this should be done at this time, whether on a one or three years' stretch, and the Government would be willing to look at the position in the light of what progress has been made on roads or what advantages there may be for one form of transport over another.

Improvements by sections is in progress on the Invergarry-Kyle road, and the worst lengths are being done first. The five and a half miles from Loan to Conlags has just been completed. The improvements will be continued in the 1970s. Paragraph 12 of the White Paper states that we are looking at other parts.
