	<div class='page-header'><h1>TOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING (SCOTLAND) BILL [	<i>Lords</i>]</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the first Amendment, I have to announce that the next meeting of the Committee will take place in Room 15. This is likely to cause a certain amount of inconvenience to hon. Members, so I will mention that the reason is that the C.P.A. has a special meeting for which it booked Room 15 many months ago. It has issued invitations to over 100 distinguished guests, and this is the only room available for this assembly. I hope, therefore, that hon. Members will have no objection if our next meeting is in Room 15.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
</section>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 21</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>DETERMINATION OF PLANNING AND SIMILAR APPEALS BY PERSONS APPOINTED BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE.</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Dr. J. Dickson Mabon)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 32, in page 23, line 35, after '1967', insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'(default powers and appeals in connection with tree preservation orders)'.</p></blockquote>
May I welcome you back to the Committee, Mr. Brewis, and say that we have progressed magnificently since you left and I hope that, we shall maintain the same good temper and fine progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a simple Amendment designed for the convenience of the reader of the Bill, because it gives a description of Section 14 of the Civic Amenities Act, 1967.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Further Amendment made:</i> No. 33, in page 24, line 14, leave out 'subsection (3) of that section' and insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'section 16(4) and (5) above'.â€”[	<i>Dr. Dickson Mabon</i>.]</p></blockquote></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>344</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 97, in page 24, line 46, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'except that the appellant, if dissatisfied, may ask the Secretary of State to endorse or overrule such decision in accordance with section 22 of this Act'.</p></blockquote>
This simple Amendment seeks to clarify the procedure if the appellant is dissatisfied. Is he denied a further right of appeal? Can the Secretary of State's direction which is referred to in Clause 22(1) be made only before an appeal is heard, or can it be made after? If an appellant is dissatisfied with a decision, can he write asking the Secretary of State to reconsider it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman deserves an assurance about the position of an appellant who might feel that there are special reasons why his appeal should be treated in a different way. If we were to accept the Amendment as it stands, it would mean we would go through the same process twice, although in the second case it would be entirely a matter for the Department, but it would involve the Department in a great deal of work for the second time and would result in delay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two out of every three appellants at present are unsuccessful, and, as an appellant would have nothing to lose by using the provision of the Amendment, most people would want to exercise their right here. The appellant might have special grounds for saying that it ought not to be considered in this way, or at least that it ought to be considered by the Secretary of State direct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is open to the Secretary of State to reserve any appeal for his own decision. It is equally open to any appellant to ask the Secretary of State to do this in the first place. Although I accept there may be special grounds for not delegating an appeal, that ought to be decided right at the begining of the process rather than at the end, because many people would be advancing the case for a second appeal when they had no special grounds. I suggest that, if an appellant feels that there are special grounds, he should exercise his right at the beginning so that the Secretary of State will decide whether he will arbitrate this matter himself without delegation. I hope that with this explanation the hon. Gentleman will not press the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1007">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>345</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. N. R. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Where is the provision whereby an appellant can ask the Secretary of State to exercise his right to determine the matter rather than the person nominated by the Secretary of State?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no reference to this in Statute, but I understand that it is a right which is not Statute-barred; and if the Secretary of State feels there are special grounds he could act in this way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point brought out by the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) was one on which I intended to seek an assurance. The Minister has answered my points fully. Would it not be a good thing to consider an Amendment at a future stage indicating that the appellant can write in advance and make it clear, in accordance with what the Minister of State has said, that the request for an appeal to be considered by the Secretary of State must be made in advance of the decision by the appointee? If the Minister can assure me that this point will be examined to see whether it is necessary or desirable, I should be glad to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is nothing in the Bill or in preceding legislation which debars the Secretary of State from reserving to himself the right to decide an appeal without delegation. Nor is there anything in Statute which debars any appellant from writing to the Secretary of State at the beginning of the process and not during or after the appeal has been heard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not certain if it would be wise to put a reference of this kind in. It could be argued that it was tautological. I doubt very much if it is wise to put in the provisions, but I will think about this and see on balance whether it is wise to make a change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister of State for his reply. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed</i>, That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be convenient to the Committee if during this debate we also consider Amendment No. 69, in page 86, line 18, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>(2) No order under this section relating to Part III of this Act shall be made unless a
	<span class='label label-info column'>346</span>
draft of the order has been approved by both Houses of Parliament.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is one of those Clauses which give rise once again to a very sharp and clear question of principle. The provisions of the Clause have already, to some extent, been canvassed during the Second Reading debate, and the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. James Davidson), when he moved Amendment No. 97, expressed concern about the same point. Is it appropriate that the final decision for an appealâ€”for convenience, I will confine myself to planning appeals under Section 14 of the 1947 Actâ€”should be by the person appointed by the Secretary of State, or should it be by the Secretary of State?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a different point from the point raised on earlier Clauses dealing with the power of a local planning authority to decide a dispute relating to its own local plan. Only last night at a local government meeting in my constituency which I was addressing, I came up against a storm of public protest about the provisions that the Committee endorsed last week, namely, a provision permitting the local planning authority to decide a dispute to which it itself was a party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Gordon Campbell) has just pointed out that we did not endorse it; nor did the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis). The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. James Davidson) dissociated himself from the Government's decision. These are important changes, and I hope that the Committee will think carefully about this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present practice is well known. Where an application under Section 12 of the Act is made and refused, an appeal is taken under Section 14 to the Secretary of State. There was no need for a provision such as that proposed by the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West a moment ago, because as the law at present stands it is automatic that it goes to the Secretary of State for his ultimate decision. He appoints a reporter to investigate the facts. The decision itself must necessarily be an administrative decision, but the reporter examines the evidence and makes recommendations. This system of reporters is one in which the public has confidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1008">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>347</span>
In major planning inquiries it is usually a member of the Bar, although there are distinguished laymen who also conduct these inquiries. For example, at this moment an application by Murco Petroleum Company is being considered in a planning inquiry by Sir Robert Russell, a man of vast experience in this sphere and for whom the public have a great respect. It would be going a long way to give that reporter, whoever he may be, the right to decide himself whether an appeal should be allowed or not. I do not believe that the average reporter would want that responsibility thrust upon him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the last resort a planning appeal, like all planning matters, is an administrative decision. In our view it is appropriate that that should be taken by a third party as is proposed here, but that that third party should be an administrative authority responsible for administration in Scotland, namely, the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An alternativeâ€”and I would be interested to know if this is what the Minister has in mindâ€”is that the panel will consist, not of part-time reporters, but of full-time salaried officials. I believe that in England and Wales they are called inspectors. If that is the proposal, it is even worse, because the suggestion is always there that the inspector or the official is an office man. I do not say that it is a justified impression, but it is one which is liable to be promoted and it is better to keep the present system, with the impartiality which it commands and the respect in which these reporters are held.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment No. 69, which stands in the name of the Minister of State, will invoke the affirmative Resolution procedure, and we are grateful for that move in our direction. However, one has to make up one's mind about this, and it is better the Committee should decide the issue clearly now. In our view, it is bad, for the reasons I have adduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our view, it is not necessary. That it is not necessary is clear from what was said in another place by the noble Lord, the Under-Secretary of State for Scotlandâ€”Lord Hughesâ€”and also by the Amendment which the Minister of State has promoted to withhold the operation of this Clause until it is deemed to be necessary to invoke it, if ever.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>348</span>
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would prefer to base our objections on these provisions, not so much on whether they may become necessary in the future, because I do not think they will, but rather because the whole purpose of this legislation is to minimise appeals and objections. If that is to be the pattern and this legislation is to workâ€”which we all sincerely hope it willâ€”there will be fewer objections to local plans and fewer appeals. However, where there are appeals it is something about which the appellant, be he an individual or a limited company, feels very strongly and the arguments for leaving things as they stand are very powerful. I ask that this change be not approved and that the Clause shall not form part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Question isâ€”â€”</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is there to be no reply?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. Brewis, but I did not realise that that was the end of the debate. However, I shall be glad to reply to the points which have been raised, and I am glad that you would like a discussion on Amendment No. 69, which has been tabled in response to arguments adduced on the Second Reading, namely, that there was no reason for departing from the present arrangements and invoking the system envisaged in Part III.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I concede straightaway that the total number of appeals in Scotland is far smaller than it is in England and Wales. At present, it is about 400 a year, compared with England's 14,000 a year. I also agree that we have nothing in Scotland to compare with the staff of salaried and expert inspectors which is attached to the Ministry of Housing and Local Government. In Scotland we hear about disputes in England and Wales where inspectors are available, and we hear that their reports do not always appear to be in line with Government policy, but I do not accept that a full-time inspector in England is a mere office man, a man who is prejudiced, or a man who does nothing in particular. The hon. and learned Member for Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) tried to make that pointâ€”â€”</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, that is not fair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1009">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>349</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman made the point that there was an appearance of partiality on the part of the salaried inspectors. All I can say is that I, too, address meetings during weekends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And get heckled as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Communists are upset by this Bill, but I do not think that hon. Members opposite would find it very comfortable if they were to be in the company of Communists. The point I am making is that I have had no protests about planning appeals at meetings which I have addressed. If I sat for a part of Edinburgh, perhaps I could expect some sort of protest because there is objection about the quinquennial review and the way in which that was handled by the Corporation, but that is not the pattern everywhere in Scotland. Indeed, in some parts of Scotland it is well-known that the protests are minimal, although we shall always have protests. That is why we have to have some system of reporters or inspectors to carry out this work. Where I disagree with the hon. and learned Gentleman is that I say that it is prudent to make provision in the Bill and to activate it when necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it was a question only of the 400 appeals I have mentioned, we might carry on as we are, but if the figure escalated, as it well might because Scotland is in a very prosperous state just now, that system would not be adequate. Scotland's industry is developing and the plans which are being produced will have by the end of this year, or next year, serious implications for our local planning authorities. Once they see the development of their areas, there is bound to be, however well it is done, a growing number of appeals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to emphasise that this procedure is not subject to negative Resolution, but to an affirmative Resolution, and that is what will be needed to activate Part III. Government time must be found for this, as hon. Members well know, and I think we should have to justify our case on the number of appeals produced. If the Government did have a case, it would be wrong for hon. Members opposite to object to having a full-time salaried inspectorate. It comes as a great surprise to me to find that Scottish Conservatives, unlike English Conserva-
	<span class='label label-info column'>350</span>
tives, appear to have no faith in a full-time salaried inspectorate. That, I would remind hon. Members, has been the system in England and Wales for the past 25 years or so, and I do not think that the English have found it biased and something which would not be acceptable to Scotsmen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. W. H. K. Baker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could we be told how many reporters or quasi-reporters the Secretary of State has on his books at the moment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am advised that we have about 12. Most of them are lawyers, with a few distinguished laymen, but all work part-time and are brought in from time to time to hear appeals. Hon. Members will surely understand that it happens that they are not always available to hear appeals at the requisite time, although we try to ensure that they are available on the occasions when they are needed. A distinguished lawyer who sits part-time naturally has other demands on his time and cannot always be available when objectors and appellants wish to have their appeals heard. I should be very surprised to hear, however, that we in Scotland do not carry out inquiries promptly and expeditiously. We try to do this, although in Falkirk recently there were very serious complaints that inquiries had gone unresolved after two or three years and, in one case, after five years. That is intolerable. I do not suggest that we cannot handle the present situation by other means, but we do not often pass major town and country planning legislation for Scotland, and here is an opportunity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anybody who knows how business goes on in the House of Commons knows how difficult it is to get a Billâ€”even an essential Billâ€”through Parliament in one Session. We have a queue of Bills already for next year and the year after, and it is not fair to imagine that a Government at the time when a Bill is needed would be able to propose the substantial amendment which Part III is. It is a substantial amendment. It could not easily be made operative just at the time it might most be needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, it is prudent that we should have Part III in the Bill ready to be activated by the Amendment to which you have drawn our attention, Mr. Brewis, so that, by affirmative Resolution, the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1010">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>351</span>
House can agree that we may bring in a full-time inspectorate in Scotland where it is needed because of the growing number of planning appeals. It is true, as I have said, that the number is only 400 now, but every time there is a major industrial development and an effort to zone more industrial land there is a public inquiry. No matter how well people are treated, there are these inquiries. I ask hon. Members to look at Ross and Cromarty as providing an example. A long time has been taken on appeals in connection with the expansion of the aluminium smelter and other industrial developments. Let us not forget that hon. Members are always asking for more industrial development in Scotland, and so there will be more of these inquiries. I should be extremely sorry if we turned away much-needed industrial development simply because we could not resolve appeals within our present planning practice. I hope that the Committee will see the prudence of keeping Part III of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Clark Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says there is a lot in the pipeline for this year and for next year. If he does not want it, he can say to his civil servants that it can all go back into the pigeon hole. I hope that when we return to power our own Front Bench will say the same thing. Secondly, there is no need slavishly to follow the English system. How many people have asked for this change from the present system? What do the local authorities, especially Edinburgh, say? Which system is the cheaper?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.0 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are naturally concerned to hear the Minister's explanation of his reason for asking us to pass these six Clauses, of which this is the first, and then keep them in suspense, because Amendment No. 69, which is being discussed at the same time, is one by which these Clauses would not be brought into operation until a later stage when both Houses of Parliament would have to consider an Order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first point, as my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) has just indicated, is that the situation is entirely different between Scotland, on the one hand, and England and Wales, on the other. I say to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>352</span>
Minister straight away that there are different systems to meet different situations, and that we on this side of the Committeeâ€”I think he has misrepresented us on this beforeâ€”see no objection to a full-time corps of inspectors in the situation which exists in England and Wales of about 14,000 cases having to be dealt with in a year. In that kind of situation, such a corps of inspectors is appropriate, but what we are representing to the Governmentâ€”I referred to this briefly on Second Readingâ€”is that the situation in Scotland is entirely different. The number of appeals is about 300 a year, and there is this group of reporters which the Minister himself at an earlier meeting of the Committee commended as having carried out a very good job and as having the confidence of all those concerned in the inquiries which they undertake.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the question of the numbers of appeals. In a Written Answer to me on 18th December, just after the Bill had been introduced, the Secretary of State gave some useful information for the last three years for which figures were known. In 1965 there were 191 inquiries in Scotland; in 1966 there were 166, and in 1967 there were 137. Quite apart from the very small number in comparison with England and Wales, the significant point is that the numbers are decreasing. There are fewer and fewer taking place, and this is why we have not felt that, on present trends at any rate, there was a need for a full time corps of inspectors as in England and Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Dickson Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was pointing out that after inquiries had been held on large issues there could be many appeals into the smaller issues which arise as a consequence. The figure I gave was the figure given to me by my officers as a reasonable figureâ€”that is, 400 as against 14,000.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I asked for a comprehensive reply on 18th December, and the Secretary of State gave me the number of appeals as well as the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1011">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>353</span>
number of inquiries, and I am very glad to read them out to the Committee. There is a great deal of information in the Written Answer, and I thanked the Government on Second Reading for having given this information because, amongst other things, it gives the average time taken over these appeals too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures for appeals for the same years wereâ€”in 1965, 383; in 1966, 302; in 1967, 341. The decrease is not a regular one in the case of appeals, but still there were fewer in 1967 than there were in 1965. This is certainly not a situation which would call for the kind of drastic action which Part III proposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister ended in his peroration with some statements about encouraging industrial development in Scotland, about which the whole Committee will agree but which is not at issue here. If the Minister thinks that there will be hundreds or thousands more appeals as a result of future industrial development, I hope that he will tell us later in this debate, because that is not what we on this side of the Committee foresee. Industrial development can take place in huge volume; it can take place in a great number of projects, but the increase in the numbers of appeals, as we see it, will be fairly small. It is not necessarily related to the bringing of projects to Scotland. On the whole, the average of projects, large and small, over the last ten years has been much the same per year. The major projects and the medium-sized ones that have started in Scotland have not had any significant effect on the numbers of appeals and inquiries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore put this question to the Minister now. Do the Government expect a great many more appeals? Do they expect the number to rise to over 1,000 a year, for example, because this estimate is the key to the question? Do they expect these to arise from the new procedures, the structure and local plans? Do they consider that this new planning legislation will produce more in the way of appeals?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly I can only get an approximation in reply, but I suggest a figure of 1,000, because that could well be a sort of sound barrier in this respect in Scotland. I ask at what stage in the increased number of appeals which the
	<span class='label label-info column'>354</span>
Government foresee would they consider it necessary to appoint a corps of inspectors? If the figure gets to over 1,000 per year, would they then consider it necessary to have a full-time corps of inspectorsâ€”and how man; ten or twenty? I think that we should be given some idea of the relationship between the number of inspectors and the number of appeals expected The Government should be able to give some estimate based on the experience of England and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to a second important point raised in the Clauseâ€”that the reporter or the inspector, as he may be called in future, should have the final decision on the appeal, unless the Secretary of State under Clause 22 directs otherwise. Here again, we come to the information given in the Written Answer on 18th December, because in that Answer the Secretary of State gave a fair indication of the delays which are occurring in Scotland. The impressive point is that there is not very much delay. Compared with England and Wales, the delay is minimal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then we come to the question whether unnecessary extra work is caused for the Scottish Office and to Ministers. Certainly the Answer of 18th December gave a welcome indication that there was little delay being caused and little extra work for the Department or for Ministers. Therefore, it seems unnecessary that the final decision should be with a reporter. Could we not leave it as it is at present? The reporter makes his investigation and the Secretary of State has the final decision. This does give the appellant the assurance that not only is the reporter investigating the whole situation but that there is also a second authority which considers his findings. That is the present situation, and I believe that a lot of appellants feel that that second opinion and the confirming authority is a useful part of the appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to Amendment No. 69, the Minister's Amendment to Clause 102. This tends to confirm our own opinion that Part IIIâ€”these six Clausesâ€”is inappropriate for Scotland and unnecessary, because previously the Minister in the other place admitted that Part III would probably be left indefinitely and that there was no proposed date for bringing it into effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1012">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>355</span>
The Minister of State has now gone further by tabling an Amendment indicating that it will not be brought in except by an Order which will be passed by affirmative Resolution. This is simply confirmation that this Part of the Bill is not appropriate to Scotland, because we shall have another complete debate in the House of Commons if the Government decide to bring it in. So this is, in one way, accepting our view that this is inappropriate. Why, in that case, replace the existing legislation at all? Why should we have this suggestion that we should pass these six Clauses to replace the existing legislation which, in this field of appeals, is working well? Why should we now be asked to replace the existing legislation by six Clauses which are to be left in the air until some future date when the Government might decide to bring in an Order which would mean we would have another debate?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I submit that it is a most unusual situation in which we are asked to place these six Clauses on the Statute Book on the basis that they may never be brought into effect. I believe it will always be found that this procedure is inappropriate to Scotland and that the number of appeals will not reach a figure which will justify a full-time corps of inspectors in Scotland. The alternative is that in many years to come a Government may seek to bring in these six Clauses, but by that time I suggest there will probably be need for changes in the planning law, anyway, so that it could be done by new legislation more appropriate to the circumstances of the day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think the Minister will agree that when the Royal Commission on Local Government in Scotlandâ€”the Wheatley Commissionâ€”has reported and the future structure of local Government in Scotland has been concluded there will be a need for Amendment of the legislation which we are passing now. It cannot be applied to some bodies the description and nature of which are as yet unknown. That would be an occasion when, if it were necessary to make some changes in the appeals procedure, those changes might be made also. Therefore, we on this side believe that to be asked to pass now Clauses which are to be held in suspense for an unknown time is quite unnecessary and that, in the present circumstances, the application of Part III to
	<span class='label label-info column'>356</span>
Scotland would be entirely inappropriate. But we ask the Minister to tell us more now about the conditions in which he contemplatesâ€”â€”</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Lawson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He has told us enough.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister will tell us whether, for example, 1,000 appeals a year would justify an inspectorate's being brought in, we should like to know, and so would a great many people in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Member for Motherwell (Mr. Lawson) would be wrong to think that this was a trivial matter. It is a matter of considerable concern to many who are interested in questions of planning procedures in Scotland and the best methods of appeal. This is an important debate on the future of these six Clauses, and I hope that the Minister of State will not dismiss it as if it is some minor point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We expect more information from the Minister before a decision is taken on this Clause, because he has given only very vague information so far. Surely he can tell us something about the quantities he foresees which would then justify bringing in a full-time inspectorate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Gordon Campbell) that this is an important matter and that the change being made here is one which should concern us to some extent. I think this is a very important change and one that, according to my conversations with people, has caused a certain amount of concern. Having said that, I can appreciate what my hon. Friend is doing. As I understand it, this is being done in case the volume of work increases, and to enable that work to be dealt with expeditiously. However, that does not necessarily mean that this will come into operation. The hon. Gentleman said it was a most unheard of thing to have in a Bill six Clauses which may never be put into operation, but it is not unheard ofâ€”</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said "unusual".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will probably remember the notorious example of the raising of the school leaving age in 1918-19. It was not put into
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1013">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>357</span>
operation by any Government and ultimately did not come into effect until after the second World War. For 25 years nobody did anything about that, so it is not unusual.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister of State is correct in saying that it might become necessary because of developments which take place. If only half the plans which are being mooted for Scotland at present take place, there will be a terrific increase in the volume of development all along the Clyde, the Moray Firth and, indeed, almost everywhere except Edinburgh. Everywhere such proposals are being put out at breakneck speed, and if only a fraction of them materialised there would be a great increase in work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not one of those who believe that because England has something it is therefore a good thing. Nevertheless, I can see the force of a step being taken to enable a Minister to do something if important industrial developments are being held up for a long time. It is necessary for the Minister to say that he needs to strengthen his arm in case certain developments take place and that, if they do, he will come back to the House, explain the situation which has arisen, and ask the House for the necessary powers. That seems to be a eminently wise thing to doâ€”the wise virgin sitting on the Front Bench. If such an Order were brought forward, I would want to debate it at great length, but nevertheless my hon. Friend is quite right in wanting to strengthen his position so that if a situation arises something can be done about it. I am sure that those who would be affected by way of employment would want that sort of action to be taken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. A. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A lot of heat is being engendered unnecessarily over this provision. All that has been happening is a discussion by means of guesswork as to what might occur in the future. It may be that the Opposition are right and that these things will not increase. It may be the Government will be pleasantly disappointed because they do not increase, in which case I take it that the Government will do nothing more about it and will use the system that works well as the moment. However, we must admit the possibility that appeals
	<span class='label label-info column'>358</span>
might increase and they might strain the capacity of even the legal profession to provide such excellent reporters to adjudicate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is there any reason why we should take out this provision, since there is ample provision for the House of Commons to safeguard itself? If a future Secretary of State, who might be the hon. Gentleman oppositeâ€”although I hope notâ€”wanted this provision, it would be a great nuisance if he had to go to the House to get a Bill through, because we in opposition should probably argue as obstinately as the hon. Gentleman argues today to ensure that he did not get the Bill. I do not believe that we should ever prevent machinery being put on the Statute Book provided that there is a safeguard such as that which the Secretary of State has offered Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman is making a non-Party point, but will he accept that the trouble about the affirmative Order procedure is that the House of Commons can only accept or reject and cannot alter the terms of legislation in order to suit the situation at the time?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is very sensible, because knowing the Scottish Grand Committee it is obviously better to get a decision relating to a simple proposition than to put it in the form of a number of Clauses that we can argue about for six weeks, because the Scottish Grand Committee is capable of doing this. Indeed, this is one of the handicaps from which Scotland suffers in getting its legislation passed. One of the great advantages of the 1948 Act was that we saved the queue in the House by enabling Scottish Bills to be discussed in the Scottish Grand Committee and as a result we hoped they would get through more promptly than they would otherwise do. Unfortunately, it provides an opportunity for obstruction and is a hindrance to the progress of legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unless the House of Commons makes itself work with the necessary speed to adapt modern society to the quick changes that are taking place in technology, the House will eventually break down. I do not think there should be this kind of argument on a thing that does not matter, purely for the sake of making party points. This provision will
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1014">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>359</span>
do no harm in the Bill. It would only entail greater public expenditure in getting the printer to take it out, and as the Opposition are opposed to public expenditure it seems ridiculous to do so. If this provision is not to be used in future, there will only be two extra pages in the Bill, and I believe that the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie), in spite of the mass meetings that he had protesting in his constituencyâ€”</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that. It was a good meeting, but not a mass meeting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether this arose as a protest against his explanation of the Bill, or whether somebody came there spontaneously to object to the removal of the legal profession from this particular job.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All that happened was that I was speaking in support of a Conservative candidate, who I am quite sure will be returned today, and I explained to the audience what was going on in the Bill. They are very sensitive about planning and when they realised that the local authority would be the ultimate arbitrator they did not seem awfully pleased.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can guarantee to go to any meeting and provoke a protest after I have explained it in a way calculated to do that. Therefore, I take this as an example of the great skill of the hon. and learned Gentleman in stimulating opposition from an audience by making speeches. I am surprised to hear that the public are worried about this, because it is difficult to get them to understand what is happening in Parliament. The Press has the greatest possible difficulty in finding matters of interest in the Scottish Grand Committee, because so much of it is words and so little of it is substance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that in this case hon. Members are making a mountain out of a molehill and the provision should be left where it is, whatever the merits of the issue, and a future Secretary of State, whether Conservative or Labour, will use his intelligence in dealing with the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may conclude the matter by answering one or two of the questions which have been posed. The local authority associations are not
	<span class='label label-info column'>360</span>
opposed to Part III. Edinburgh has not given us any views on Part III. I would not necessarily expect the local authorities to express opposition or support, because they are not primarily affected by planning appeals, but I will give the facts as I was asked by my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis). If the new system were introduced and there were, by definition, a larger number of appeals to be dealt withâ€”I will discuss the number in a minuteâ€”then they would be dealt with in an entirely different situation. I am advised that, if we were dealing with a substantially larger number of appeals, this would be a more economical way of doing it than by retaining the present system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked whether the system under Part III would be more expensive or cheaper. The first point made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East was about legislation. I realise that this is a sincerely held view by hon. Members opposite, and it is evidenced by the years when the Conservatives were in power. We were then never congested with legislation. I will concede that we never had too many Bills in those days.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not what was said at the time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that is not true.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was a Whip at the time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I took up my post in 1964, I was astonished at the number of Bills that had been lying on the shelves. For example, the first Bill I promoted, straight out of the hon. Gentleman's pigeon hole, had been recommended in the early 1950s and it was passed by us in 1964 and received the Royal Assent in 1965. That was the Rivers (Prevention of Pollution) (Scotland) Act. The first Bill had been under the Labour Government in 1951, for which the original inquiry was started in 1947, under my right hon. Friend now Secretary of State. It was received by Mr. Hector McNeil in 1950, a Bill was passed in 1951, another inquiry was held in 1953, and then that Bill lay dormant until we came into office in 1964. So I accept the point that a generosity of legislation is not the hallmark of a Conservative
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1015">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>361</span>
Government. Indeed, one of my fears is that if there were, unfortunately, another Conservative Government this matter would not be dealt with in time, because it would mean debating a revised form of Part III once again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not agree that this could go into a local government Bill, because it would be outwith the scope of the Bill. One might as well have argued about the Water Act that we should have waited until the Royal Commission reported and the Local Government Act was passed. That would be quite impossible, because it would be a huge Act and heaven knows those of us who have made some attempt to look at what it might be like realise that it will be a big enough Bill without adopting the Sections dealing with planning, water, sewage, and so on. It is true that we have been busy in the last five years bringing up to date the Statutes governing local government, in anticipation of local government reform.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is speaking of a possible future local government Bill, but my point was that this planning legislation would also have to be changed. Would there not have to be changes in planning legislation with new local government structures coming into being?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is provision for the adaptation of preceding Statutes by a future Bill and we would be able to adapt, although the Bill is well suited for the reform of local government. It might be adaptation by a few simple adaptive Clausesâ€”</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: By another Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: By a Bill on local government, which would deal with all the Statutes which we have modernised and adapt them to a new system, but it is wrong to argue that we should have a section of a local government Bill dealing with planning appeals, or a section dealing with water act matters, with appeals, or with other matters. That is just the same as saying that we should have a part dealing with police legislation not related to local government organisation. I think that the House authorities would rule that outwith the scope of a Bill to reform local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>362</span>
The difference between the Opposition and us on this is, not that the present system and the present volume of appeals will always be satisfactory. No one is preparedâ€”and certainly not the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Gordon Campbell), whose speech was quite revealingâ€”to say that the situation will remain as it is. There is a feeling that the system could change and could become overloaded. The hon. Gentleman has gone on record as saying that he thinks perhaps 1,000 appeals instead of 400 would be a sound barrierâ€”</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I was asking the Minister of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said it, and it is a fair point. It may be 1,000, but it may be higher and I do not want to be thirled to 1,000. The hon. Gentleman is conceding the point that there is a number at which it is reasonable to go over to a new system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is misunderstanding me. I was not conceding anything but asking the hon. Gentleman if he could tell us what the number was. I have no idea what it is. I was asking whether the Minister could estimate whether 1,000 would be the sort of number which would necessitate changing the present system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know the number, because it depends on the judgment of Ministers at that time and on the nature of the appeals and the demands on the office. No one knows.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And on the availability of people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the availability of people operating it. The hon. Member for Moray and Nairn is clever at trying never to commit himself, but he will learn that he has to if he is to be believed. He has committed himself to the proposition that there is a certain number at which the present system will crack or actively deter the economic development of Scotland. If the hon. Member is not saying that, his speech does not mean much. We will read his speech closely, but, as I see it, he concedes that there is a limit, and if that limit is reached he would bring in a Bill or operate the affirmative resolution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1016">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>363</span>
The hon. Gentleman was kind enough to sayâ€”I hope he will not run away from thisâ€”that in certain circumstances an inspectorate is a not unreasonable way to do this. He was not criticising the English for having that system. It was appropriate for 14,000 appeals in a country of nearly 50 million people. One might say that in a country of 5 million people it would seem reasonable that 1,400 was the kind of figure at which an inspectorate system might be introduced, but the system was introduced in England before there were 14,000 appeals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought I was wise in going to my right hon. Friend and saying, "Let us table an Amendment to have an affirmative Resolution procedure". He agreed promptly to that suggestion, which I thought would be welcomed. We have met the criticismsâ€”the legitimate criticismsâ€”and I do not retreat from the fact that in present circumstances we should not have Part III operating in Scotland, as long as the present number of appeals stands. That is a fair decision and it is right to bring in the affirmative Resolution procedureâ€”not the negative procedure, which some grudging Ministers might bring inâ€”with the onus of proof on the Government. I do not see how I can go further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman agree that if for some reason the volume of appeals increased and a change had to be made, it is possible that by that time we would have a top-tier local authority organisation and that that, rather than an inspectorate, might be the answer.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) fully appreciates the position of top-tier authorities if they were created. Are they the repositories of Government policy? By definition, they are still local government. If a full-time salaried inspector with all the expertise and knowledge of public policy does not know, he is not much of an expert. I am trying to say that this is a proper interpretation, but even if the hon. and learned Gentleman were right and there is nothing which causes us to activate Part III, we could adapt it
	<span class='label label-info column'>364</span>
in the local government Bill. No harm would be done but there would be harm, to this or any succeeding administrationâ€”if hon.

Would it not be wise to make provision for the Secretary of State to supplement the existing system by an inspectorate and not to have a revolutionary change from lawyers to inspectors?

My right hon. Friend the Member for East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn) made a fair point, and we could appoint full-time reporters. We will probably stick to the name "reporter".

remove this Part of the Bill we would rob ourselves of that final resort if the volume of appeals became greater. It would be no solution for the Government of the day to say that it was the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Gordon Campbell) who caused this confusion, or the hon. and learned Member for Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) who is causing the slow-up of development in Scotland and breaking the planning machine. It is possibly true that we will have a growing number of apepals testing the present system. All I am saying is that we should have the right to come to the House with an affirmative Resolution and let hon. Members contest the argument and debate it fully and then to put Part III into operation or refuse to allow the Secretary of State to do so. What could be more reasonable? No one disputes that it might be necessary or that the inspectorate system is good because it works well in England. No one is prepared to impugn the honour of the inspectorate there. If that is the case, why not give the Secretary of State power to implement Part III if circumstances and the policy of the day demand it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The attitude of the Minister is a little disappointing, although I appreciate that he is trying to come some way in the right direction by having an affirmative Resolution procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I cannot help feeling, when he talks about the "generosity of legislation", that this is not in itself a yardstick of good government, and I doubt whether he would find many people to agree that it is. We are doing something which would appear in a list of priorities in a Government timetable. There are masses of things to be done and thousands of things we could be legislating for because we feel they might be useful one day. We could go on for ever and clutter up the timetable. It seems an error to debate something like this when we have the possibility of local government reform which may completely demolish all the Minister's arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have been very generous with their legislationâ€”far too generousâ€”and probably we have only seen the tip of the iceberg. There could be much more. The Minister of State twits us with a Rivers (Prevention of Pollution) Bill which he produced from
	<span class='label label-info column'>366</span>
the Scottish Office. When my hon. Friend the Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Gordon Campbell) takes over at the Scottish Office, he will have to have some form of pigeon hole pollution Bill to clear up the waste accumulated by this Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a waste of time that we should be talking about something which may never be needed, on the notion that simply because it is useful in England therefore it might one day be useful in Scotland. I hope that the Minister will not close his mind to this altogether and perhaps he might at some later stage of the Bill even find some means of discreetly withdrawing this idea altogether.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would first like to refer to the suggestion which the right hon. Member for East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn) made, which indicated that he had certainly seen the point we on this side of the Committee were making. But the situation is not quite as straightforward as he indicated. The right hon. Gentleman said that this was simply a question of the printers having to drop six Clauses from the Bill. We are being asked to pass legislation which everyone in the Committee agrees is inappropriate in the present circumstances in Scotland. The Minister of State said just now that it would be wrong for Scotland at present. So this is a bit more than dropping Clauses out of the Bill. All legislators are extremely worried about something going through which even the Government of the day consider is wrong in present circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister just now seemed to think that I was explaining the Government Bill; but I made no attempt to do so. I tried to get the Minister to explain it. I asked him if he would tell us in what circumstances he contemplated that the corps of inspectors would be brought into existence. I was not making this determination. It is a difficult one, but I think the Government ought to have some idea of the situation in which they would bring the Order before the House to activate this part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister replied to some extent, because he said it was not possible to give even an estimate of the number of cases involved and that it would depend on many other circumstances as well. So
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1018">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>367</span>
we on this side are left with the impression that the Government would activate this part of the Bill when there was a considerable increase in the amount of work. I do not think that we can go further than that. So we are left with the vague situation as to the circumstances in which this part of the Bill would be brought into action, but we know that the circumstances are wrong now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a second point about which we feel strongly and I was glad to hear the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) agree with this. In the Clause it is being left to the reporter to take the final decision, except in the particular cases in Clause 22 when the Secretary of State directs otherwise. It is a retrograde step to take away the second opinion and confirming authority which is such an assurance to appellants at present. For these reasons, we feel it is wrong to accept legislation now which is inappropriate to Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed</i>, That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do I understand that the practice will be that the Secretary of State will determine at the outset whether an appeal will be considered by him or by one of his inspectors, or can he operate Section 22 at any stage in the proceedings? I notice, for example, that in the following Clause there is an odd
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1019">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>369</span>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I indicated to the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. James Davidson), the Secretary of State at the beginning has the right to do this, and if the appellant wishes he can ask the Secretary of State to do it, giving special circumstances as to why the Secretary of State should do this, just in case he is not sure the Secretary of State will follow that procedure. But he does have the power to agree to this change while the proceedings are going on. It would be exceptional, but it is right and proper on the argument of flexibility that the Secretary of State should have this reserve right, because something may emerge which might indicate that in the first instance it ought to have been heard in that particular way</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed</i>, That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Subsection (1) makes this odd provision:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where the Secretary of State has appointed a person to determine an appeal under section 21 above, the Secretary of State may, at any time before the determination of the appeal, appoint another person to determine it instead of the first-mentioned person".</p></blockquote>
What is the thinking behind that? Is it envisaged that the first person appointed may be making such a hash of the proceedings that the Secretary of State has to replace him; and, if so, how does he get to know about this?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He might be offered a better brief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. We are dealing here with the full-time inspectorate. We have dispensed with the almost gratuitous services of the legal profession, who perform
	<span class='label label-info column'>370</span>
such useful work for a very minimal fee; and the reporters are not exactly highly fee'd, and do not expect to be. The Secretary of State now has it at the back of his mind that, having appointed this person, he would replace him. It cannot be that he has in mind the reporter's falling sick. It is true that he might be promoted, even to the Scottish Development Department, if that still exists.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman made two revealing remarks in the course of his interrogatory passage. The first was that the legal profession for a purely nominal fee help in the inquiries. In case it is a measure of advocates' incomes, that "purely nominal" fee is 20 guineas a day. I am sure many persons would be breathless at being told that that was a purely nominal fee. A proper wage for an advocate must, then, be rather substantial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other thing that surprised me was that hon. and learned Gentleman's reference to the question of reporters falling ill. I know that the legal profession is immune from a great deal, but its members are certainly not immune from sickness; nor are the reporters. On one occasion two years ago one actually died in the middle of a public inquiry. Even by law we cannot prevent that. It is therefore right that we should have a provision to appoint another person when the original person is ill. It is primarily for that reason that we are anxious to have this Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the existing position? I do not think that there are existing statutory provisions for replacing people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Off the cuff I cannot say. But if there are no Statutes, it is just as well that we make this change, because we have been very fortunate so far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn) made an interpolation about a better brief. It is not unheard of for public inquiries to be adjourned in order that the other responsibilities of the advocates concerned can be discharged, and then they return to the public inquiry. It was not an unreasonable comment that my right hon. Friend made. If we do not have a full-time inspectorate, we must have

	<span class='label label-info column'>371</span>

	<p>12 noon.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely it is not necessary to have statutory powers to replace somebody who falls ill when there are already statutory powers to appoint somebody else. I think that there is something more behind this, but I do not wish to hold up the proceedings because of a point like this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am told that the inquiry starts again from the beginning if the inspector falls ill, and that is precisely what I do not think is desirable. The reporter can be replaced for legitimate reasons such as becoming ill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister really mean that if the reporter is ill somebody else will have to take over where he has left off?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would surely be a nonsense to say that every time somebody falls sick the inquiry has to start again.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that it is proposed to replace the existing provisions of the 1947 Act, and certain provisions of the Post Office Act, 1953, with these new provisions, and I asked why it was necessary to start re-writing the provisions.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. and learned Member would look to Clauses subsequent to Clause 27, he will see that new powers for the Minister of Public Building and Works and for the Postmaster-General are provided, otherwise they would have no convenient powers of compulsory acquisition. The Clause repeals Sections 34 and 35 of the 1947 Act and Section 47 of the Post Office Act, 1953. The power repealed cannot be exercised without the sanction of Parliament, and a local inquiry has to be held and a public Bill promoted. This archaic procedure was first laid down in the Post Office (Land) Act, 1881 and is so cumbersome that it is practically never used nowadays and, in place of it, the Post Office promotes an ordinary hybrid Bill. We thought that we should clarify

As regards the Post Office, the Minister is invoking a simplified procedure such as other Government Departments enjoy in favour of separate legislation.

The head of the Department is called the Minister of Works in Section 35, but I imagine that that has been amended by subsequent legislation, and I take it that what applies to the Ministry of Public Building and Works applies to the Post Office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for drawing my attention to that and my final comment was that the fears of the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West
	<span class='label label-info column'>374</span>
(Mr. James Davidson) were groundless. I trust that the right hon. Gentleman can hear that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 140, in page 28, line 21, leave out from beginning to end of line 37 and insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'that the acquisition is necessary for the purposes of the structure plan or the local plan'.</p></blockquote>
This is a short Amendment which seeks to simplify the provisions of paragraphs (	<i>a</i>), (	<i>b</i>), (	<i>c</i>) and (	<i>d</i>) in subsection (1). One has always to be careful that powers of compulsory acquisition are related to the purposes for which they are granted, and I am always reluctant to allow to pass too easily provisions such as we find in this Clause. For example, paragraph (	<i>b</i>) reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"that it is expedient in the public interest that the land should be held together with land so required â€¦"</p></blockquote>
One knows that statutory bodies in these days have to have wide powers of acquisition, but I suggest that we want to be very sure that we are not giving powers which are unnecessarily wide. I do not suggest that the drafting of the Amendment is necessarily correct, but that some qualifying provision might be desirable to ensure that the acquisition powers given to local authorities, acting as planning authorities, can be exercised only in the context of the structure plan and the local requirements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The effect of the Amendment would be to omit the specified circumstances under which the Secretary of State can authorise a local authority to acquire land compulsorily and to put in the place of the circumstances one single circumstance, namely
	<br><blockquote><p>"that the acquisition is necessary for the purposes of the structure plan or local plan."</p></blockquote>
If we agreed to this Amendment, the effect would be to restrict the power in some ways and to extend it in others and neither the restriction nor the extension is desirable. The circumstances specified in the Bill are four in number and are first, that the land is required for the development, redevelopment, or improvement as a whole of the area in which it is situated; secondly, that it is land which, in the public interest, ought to be held with that land; thirdly, that the land is required for comprehensive development; or, lastly, that the land
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1022">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>375</span>
must be acquired immediately to achieve a purpose necessary for the proper planning of the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These powers replace those in Section 34 of the 1947 Act, but they differ from them in two ways. The most important difference is that they are more flexible, because it is no longer necessary for land to be designated or allocated in the development plan. This flexibility is necessary, since it will often be impossible to tell from the structure plan whether a particular area of land is designated for a particular use or not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the Amendment would be to compel a local authority in every case to relate the proposed acquisition to the proposals of the structure plan or the local plan. This would be restrictive and unnecessary. If the local authority can show that the acquisition is justified in the interests of proper planning, without reference to the development plan, there is no reason why they should not be allowed to proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that there should be safeguards, but there are well established provisions in the Acquisition of Land Acts to ensure that the grounds of acquisition are fully examined and that acquisition will not be authorised without sufficient justification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So much for the restriction. The Amendment would also obliterate the specified purposesâ€”development, redevelopment, and so onâ€”expressed in the Clause as it stands. This would make it more difficult for both the landowner and the planning authority to focus the arguments deployed at a public inquiry and would thus be an undesirable widening of the area of argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I trust that with that explanation the Committee will agree that it would be wrong to wipe out these four provisions and replace them only by one provision which, as I have explained, would widen the area of argument between landowner and local authority at a later stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that explanation. The Amendment was tabled to ensure that local powers of compulsory purchase were not too wide.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 98, in page 28, line 37, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>(	<i>e</i>) that it is desirable in the public interest to reallocate the land between agricultural, forestry, amenity, or recreational purposes; or</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(	<i>f</i>) that it is desirable to purchase agricultural land in that area to enable suitably qualified farmers and entrants to the agricultural industry to be given vacant possession of agricultural units of economic size on a rent and repayment basis.</p></blockquote>
I am very concerned indeed about the proper conservation of balance between agriculture, forestry and recreation in the rural areas of Scotland, and I am particularly concerned at the rate at which small farms are disappearing from the scene.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know if the Minister of State has taken a trip round the Scottish countryside in the last two or three weeks, but if he does so, particularly in areas where small farms are prevalent, he will see farm after farm where all the machinery and implements are set out ready for rouping out. I know that the numbers in my own constituency which are rouping out and disappearing are certainly in the thirties and forties, and probably considerably higher than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The small farm is rapidly disappearing off the Scottish rural scene, and I think this is a very sad event indeed. Not only is it sad from an emotional point of view, but it is extremely regrettable, because these farms are perhaps the best source of training for farmers who are later going to take on larger farms. They provide the backbone and the skeleton of our agricultural industry.

We have recently heard arguments about the need, or lack of need, for the Agricultural Training Board, but I put it to the Minister that far more important than any agricultural training board is the farming ladder comprising farms of various sizes which enable men, and sometimes women, who have not inherited a lease or a farm which they own to get into the agricultural industry. They need a very real incentive, and I believe that by far the best incentive that anybody can have in the farming industry is the possibility one day of farming a farm of their own. This encourages a spirit of independence and self-reliance, and perhaps the opportunities for this in

our society today are few and far between.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archie Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman spoke of the number of small farms going out, but are not many of them being merged into larger economic units?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was going to mention the amalgamation scheme. I am not against it in principle. I have raised many times the question of when two farms, one of uneconomic size and one of economic size, are in competition for a small unit. The small unit has no advantage in this battle. The small unit often loses and is still left in an uneconomic condition. I think it is a great pity that this point has never been met, and I mention it in passing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point I wanted to make, however, is that size is by no means always a corollary of efficiency. I can take the Minister to small farms in my constituency which are extremely efficient. I know of one man whose skill in husbandry, and skill in the buying and selling of cattle, enables him to make more than Â£3,000 a year from 50 acres. But farms to let are becoming fewer and fewer. This is the other side of the coin to security of tenure legislation, which I most strongly favour, but the Minister will recognise that it has two sides. If the landlord of a farm knows that by letting it he is likely to lose any opportunity of gaining control of the land again for many generations, he will think twice before he lets it. Even if he does not want it, he may take it and farm it alongside other land rather than lose control over it for, perhaps, more than a century to come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that something is very badly needed to redress the balance, and the Amendment is an attempt to do just that. I regard it as far more important than any other Amendment I have tabled to the Bill, and I hope that the Minister will look at it in this light. It is trying to do a specific thing. It is trying to redress the balance of small farms going out of production and to re-set the lower rungs in the farming ladder and to give an opportunity to men and women trying to get a start on the farming ladder. In a booklet "A Plan for the North-East", published in 1964, we put forward a plan for local authorities to take up land
	<span class='label label-info column'>378</span>
and let it or sell it to young men and women who might not otherwise get into the profession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will give two examples of the kind of occasions I would envisage when this might be done. The first is when a large sporting estate is up for sale. There might be on this land a bit of good grazing land. There might be quite a lot of hillside eminently suitable for afforestation. I think that in circumstances like this it should be open for the local authority in the public interest compulsorily to acquire that land and to ensure that the agricultural portions of it are properly used. In areas like East Scotland, where forestry planting land is scarce, the local authorities should see that suitable land for planting is obtained. Also, though the Countryside (Scotland) Bill will deal with this point to some extent, local authorities should see that land suitable for access to the public is made accessible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a second example one might get a small agricultural estate of a few farms, or even one very large farm, which could quite efficiently be farmed as two or three medium-sized units. In such circumstances I do not believe that it is always desirable that the land should automatically be taken in by some nearby farm. In many cases it would be preferable that local authorities should take up the land and make it available to
	<br><blockquote><p>"suitably qualified farmers and entrants to the agricultural industry"</p></blockquote>
who would pay for it
	<br><blockquote><p>"on a rent and repayment basis".</p></blockquote>
This would give a real opportunity for men to get into the industry. By "qualified", I do not necessarily mean a college qualification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know of a man who is just giving up a forty-acre unit which adjoins my own farm, and what will happen to this unit I do not know, because it belongs to a landlord. This man is an example of a type who should be encouraged. He was a farm servant. He became a grieve and he went into this 40-acre holding. By sheer hard work he has kept his head above water for four or five years. He works his own place in the evenings, and does odd jobs and works for other farmers round about. He has now been offered the tenancy of another farm up the top of Strathdon. There are few
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1024">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>379</span>
opportunities for men of this calibre. This man has been luckyâ€”he has carved out and made his own opportunity and grasped it with both hands, and I wish him all the luck in the world. But far too many of his type lose heart, give up and have to go into something else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appeal to the Minister to look very closely at the Amendment. Where does planning begin and where does planning end? In my view, planning should cover this sort of contingency and give this sort of opportunity. I hope that the Minister, if he cannot accept the Amendment, will at least give me an assurance that he will look at the position which I have tried to bring out in proposing the Amendment because unless something is done soon opportunities for entry to the agricultural industry will disappear entirely, and with them will disappear the kind of man who is the salt of the earth, at least in rural Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I feel very strongly that the Minister should go as far as he can in the direction of meeting the purpose of the Amendment. This is a subject very close to my own interests and heart, and I have spoken on it on many occasions and written about it in the Press and elsewhere in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know the very widespread interest there is in Scotland in this subject, and the very great public sympathy, especially in the Highlands and Islands, for the people whom this proposal could help. The hon. Gentleman is right in emphasising the importance of having a reserve of land under responsible auspices available for renting. It is extremely important, because hitherto the difficulty has been that very well qualified and well experienced people capable of farming in their own right have been simply excluded from the possibility of doing so for their whole lifetime because they have not been able to accumulate the cash to purchase. They have been excluded by the high and ever rising cost of acquiring farms by purchase. Therefore, it is important, perhaps more than ever before, that there should be created a reserve of land under a responsible authority on the general basis suggested by the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder whether the Highlands and Islands Development Board might not very greatly strengthen the impact of its activities in the Highlands and Islands,
	<span class='label label-info column'>380</span>
its influence and its own value and status, by going into this field much more prominently than it has done so far? The Board has done extremely good work in other fields and has done a great deal to encourage industrial development on a large and small scale. It has helped many people in many projects. But in this field of agricultural development it is rather inactive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the renting agency, whether it is the local authorities, the Highlands and Islands Development Board or some other responsible agency, does not matter quite so much. The important thing is the aim and principle of the Amendment, and I think that the Minister and the Government should look very sympathetically at this. If my hon. Friend had known the number of ambitious, capable, experienced younger and older men who have wanted to go into farming and found it impossible because of shortage of cash, then he would look very sympathetically indeed at the Amendment and its purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point is that even when a man is able to raise what would appear to be a fair amount of capital to start out on his own he still has to think of having to buy in the open market, often against keen competition from landowners who are able to raise money fairly easily against all sorts of security which he cannot provide. Also, he has to look a little ahead to the cost of buying machinery and the cost of improvements of all kinds. He may be fully qualified and be able to take advantage of such land and intensively exploit it in the best personal and general interest but is frustrated financially.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise again that this is a field in regard to which the Highlands and Islands Development Board might well come into the picture a lot more than it has done hitherto, possibly, as proposed here, as holders and renters of good-scale farming units.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. James Davidson) has raised a fundamental problem for Scotland and one which I think goes far beyond the confines of the Bill. When we introduced the Agricultural Charter, this was part of the background to the Charter. At that time, the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1025">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>381</span>
Central Agricultural Committees were given the power to do what the hon. Gentleman suggests. At a later stage hon. Gentlemen opposite wiped out that control locally, but even then I believe that this kind of planning must be done on a much large and wider scale than can be done by any single planning authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This question concerns the whole agricultural industry of Scotland. Something which has probably passed unnoticed in this development is that, with the growing efficiency of agriculture and the fact that in the Price Review so much stress is placed on efficiency in order to gain a livelihood on the land, naturally a great deal of inefficient farming must be squeezed out of Scotland if the agricultural industry is to survive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This may not be the case with the farms mentioned by the hon. Gentleman. In Dumfriesshire, for example. I came across a farmer on a Government smallholding who was not earning a very big income but who was acquiring great kudos by producing prize cattle that were taking championships. In fact, that smallholding had more prize cattle than some of the large farms. The Government have these nurseries where men can progress from being workers to using their skill on their own behalf on bigger farms. This should be developed as a system throughout the country, and I suggest to my hon. Friend the Minister of State that he should recommend the Secretary of State to think carefully as to whether this whole question should not be examined in relation to the way in which farming in Scotland is to be organised in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems more likely now that we may enter the Common Market, and this may mean a painful readjustment within the farming industry. Indeed, already this is taking place. We are talking about the loss of jobs in Scotland; and this has been particularly so in the agricultural industry, for the simple reason that generally speaking it has become so efficient that it is producing far more with far less labour. This is something to be commended and not deplored.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember being asked to write a report of an investigation as to what was happening in Wales. We found that
	<span class='label label-info column'>382</span>
workers were leaving the land and going to well-paid jobs in industry and the farming community of Wales was being reduced to the proper number of people who ought to exist on the land instead of maintaining the large number of people who were there in the bad years of this century. This is not only an agricultural problem but one closely associated with other developments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would say to the Opposition, who are supposed to have a great interest in agriculture, that this would seem to be an appropriate matter for them to raise on a Supply Day in order to discuss the future of agriculture in Scotland. If the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West were to instigate such a discussion and eventually some decisions were reached, he would have done a service, not only to this Committee, but to Scotland as a whole. It goes far beyond the bounds of the Bill, and it is not within the powers of local planning authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the Minister before we have to refer this question, as has just been hinted, to Brussels ultimately, to take into account the fact that the Highlands and Islands Development Board has powers under the existing legislation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Much as I am tempted to go into the whole discussion, particularly in regard to paragraph (	<i>f</i>) in the Amendment, I do not think it would be desirable at this time, because it would not do justice to an important subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn), whose contribution I appreciated, made the point both at the beginning and at the end of his speech that one could not insert into a Planning Bill, not just a question of agricultural land, but also of its tenancy and ownership. This is strictly a matter for an agricultural Act. We have already had reference to the Agriculture Act, 1967, and the Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1968, both of which represent Government policy as of today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nor would I like to be enticed into the pathways which my hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) would like me to pursue on the question of the activities of the Highlands and Islands Development Board in relation to its powers in connection with
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1026">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>383</span>
paragraph (	<i>f</i>). That would be better dealt with on the Floor of the House as a separate issue. If the Government get all the legislation which is now in progress, and I am confident that we shall, there is no reason why we should not have time to go into this matter more fully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept paragraph (	<i>e</i>) as proposed by the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. James Davidson). It is right and proper that this should be made, but I ask him to look closely at paragraph (	<i>d</i>) in subsection (1). I have read paragraph (	<i>e</i>) very closely and I think it could be said that it is unnecessary to put that paragraph into the Bill in such form. Indeed the treacherous point has been put to me that paragraph (	<i>d</i>) governs the point the hon. Gentleman is making in paragraph (	<i>e</i>), but I am alarmed that it might be arguable that Parliament was intending to impose a limitation, which is not the point. If Parliament had intended to impose a limitation in the agricultural context, there would be no need to specify it in the way expressed in paragraph (	<i>e</i>). I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman is with me in that argument. It is the legal advice which has been tendered to me that we would actually be acting in the opposite direction, and I do not agree with that, any more than does the hon. Member. I accept paragraph (	<i>e</i>), but that is within paragraph (	<i>d</i>), and to try to spell it out within a new paragraph (	<i>e</i>) would in fact do the opposite to what is intended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With reference to paragraph (	<i>f</i>), I return to my original point. I do not think it is for a Planning Bill to lay down the questions of the desirability of ownership or tenancies or the balance of one against the other. I know that the hon. Gentleman did not like the 1967 Actâ€”or at least some parts of it. I know that he did not like the absorption of small farms by large farms, but if we are to enter Europe, or even if Europe were irrelevant and we ran agriculture for ourselves and without regard to our competitors, we would have to accept the need for economic farms. We have much to teach the French and Germans in that regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1968, the Government proved that they wish to enhance the security of tenure in certain areas to tenant farmers. The Land Court may authorise a landlord to take possession from the heir to the tenant farm if it
	<span class='label label-info column'>384</span>
feels that he is not able to carry out the work of the farm because he is not sufficiently experienced to farm it efficiently or that the unit is not sufficient to provide employment for two men. In other words, there is still the reservation based on economics and viability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have to some extent been tempted into a discussion on this matter, but I think that the right place to measure the balance of both these Acts and the provision in paragraph (	<i>f</i>) is when we are dealing with agriculture as such, and I would reinforce the plea made by my right hon. Friend. Agriculture is an excellent subject for an Estimates debate. I do not think that it is right for us to put into a Planning Bill the provision outlined in paragraph (	<i>f</i>). I do not know whether it is technically outwith the scope of the Long Title of the Bill, but certainly in spirit it is not right in a Planning Bill to try to interpolate matters of tenancy and ownerships.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Gentleman is satisfied that paragraph (	<i>e</i>) is taken up by the generality of paragraph (	<i>d</i>) and is not limited or restricted in any way. I hope that he realises that I accept the spirit of paragraph (	<i>f</i>), but not the contention that in a Planning Bill we should spell out paragraph (	<i>f</i>) in the way he does here. I hope that he will not persist in the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was interesting to hear the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. James Davidson) facing up to the fact that there are times when certain legislation which we bring forward with a view to solving certain problems, removing social injustice, and the like, tends to create more problems than it solves. We warned the Government when the Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill was going through the House that owners, instead of letting their farms would tend to hang on to them due to the fixity of tenure induced thereby. Now the hon. Gentleman is trying to overcome that problem, and one wonders where the process will stop. This is what happens when one starts to interfere with an industry where there is a fair balance between the law of supply and demand. Difficulties arise, and the balance is disturbed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn) mentioned some farms in Dumfriesshire. I was not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1027">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>385</span>
sure whether he was talking about some small holdings which I think were created just after the 1914-18 war with well-meaning intentions to provide nice little units where soldiers could be settled on the land and which almost ever since have been a terrible problem. What had been a decent-sized farm was broken up into garden-sized holdings which quickly proved uneconomic. On them individuals struggled for many years against great adversity. Although intentions may be good, one often ends by causing more difficulties and social injustice than one was solving. The Amendment is interesting from that point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to paragraph (	<i>f</i>), how would vacant possession of these agricultural units be forthcoming? I am not clear how one would get possession. Supposing one compulsorily acquires, someone is bound to be occupyingâ€”either the tenant or the owner. What means is to be used to dispossess? Is one to say, "We do not like your face and we will take this away from you"? It would probably work well in Communist Russia, but it would be interesting to hear whether that is the intention of the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This debate is a change, and it is interesting to hear the Minister of State embarking on agricultural matters, and to hear his knowledge and to have a wide debate bringing in the Common Market. The right hon. Gentleman who raised the Common Market, the right hon. Member for East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn)â€”should know that the Common Market's present-day prices would be much better for farmers than prices here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are grateful to the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. James Davidson) for raising this subject. He is right to say that there is a great problem for young people and people wanting to get on and being able to get on their feet on the lower rungs of the farming ladder. I have no time for those who say that, because a better wage can be earned working in a factory than on a small farm, a person should not work on a small farm. Why should not a man work on a small farm if he is prepared to accept a lower standard? To
	<span class='label label-info column'>386</span>
that extent I have great sympathy with the spirit in which the hon. Gentleman moved the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North (Earl of Dalkeith), I am interested that the hon. Gentleman admitted the lack of security in the present system of security of tenure for young people and those who are less well off and trying to get the tenancy of a small farm. This is developing. The right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis), who follows these matters with great interest, will remember that my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) moved an Amendment on the Report stage of the Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1968 which contained words similar to those included in paragraph (	<i>f</i>). The type of person mentioned in paragraph (	<i>f</i>) is the type we are anxious to help to get into smaller farms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also interested, with my knowledge of North-East Scotland, to know that there are, I understand, far more applications for amalgamation there than in any other area of Scotland. I have been in correspondence with the Under-Secretary dealing with agriculture in the Scottish Office. There have been criticisms of the Department that it is not quick enough in allowing these amalgamations to go through. The reason I have been given is that the volume of work and the number of applications from the North-East are greater than had been expected in proportion to the staff of the Department of Agriculture.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the hon. Member of a simple point I brought out some time ago in another debate, that there are more smallholdings in Aberdeenshire than in any of the so-called crofting counties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, but I merely pointed out that the Department of Agriculture, with its knowledge of the North-East of Scotland, has been surprised by the number of applications. The question which worries me, and it was touched on by the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) is: who will administer this land? One understands that the Department of Agriculture's holdings are vested in the Secretary of State's Department, which has experience in agricultural matters.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1028">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>387</span>
It is also taken care of in Highland areas by the Highlands and Islands Development Board. I am concerned that to vest land in local authorities is not to vest it in the best public body. Has the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West had any representations from local authorities that they would like this type of power? They are probably not the best body and not those who want the powers. Although I am sympathetic to the way the Amendment has been moved and the reasons for which it has been moved, I would question how practicable it is for tackling the problems he mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State, through his own position as the largest landowner, has the means of answering the spirit of the Amendment, for which the Minister of State expressed great sympathy. He said that he appreciated the need for the number of smallholdings. Perhaps he will give us some indication of Government thinking and tell us the Secretary of State's policy about his own holdings. In my part of Scotland the Secretary of State's policy is to amalgamate his own holdings and reduce the numbers of opportunities for people coming into the industry in a small way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was hoping desperately that we would not get too involved in this, but if he will look at my speech the hon. Member will find that I did not say that at all. I accepted paragraph (	<i>e</i>) inasmuch as it was within the generality of paragraph (	<i>d</i>). I did not express an opinion about paragraph (	<i>f</i>). That is a matter of balance, and in a Planning Bill one could not go into this. I do not want the hon. Member to think that I favour smaller units of agriculture. I do not. They have to be economic. Although I am in favour of people coming into farming, I am not in favour of them having unviable and uneconomic units where they work hard and do not make much money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister of State for his intervention, which has clarified his attitude and that of the Government to their own holdings. I hope that the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West will answer my points. This is an Amendment slightly outwith the scope of the Bill, and I accept the assurance that paragraph (	<i>e</i>) comes within paragraph (	<i>d</i>).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>388</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There always seem to be good reasons, when I table an Amendment, why it should fall outside the scope of the Bill under discussion. It it unfair. I am far from content with the answers I have received. It never seems to be the right Bill. The Minister missed the whole point of the Amendment, which is based on my concern, and that of other hon. Members, at the lack of an entry to the agricultural industry and the use of land for that purpose. I do not understand why this is not eligible for inclusion in a Planning Bill. We cannot draw a hard and fast line. This is as much a purpose of planning as is anything else, and I do not accept what the Minister said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the slightly snide remark by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North (Earl of Dalkeith) about my intentions, and his reference to Communism and Soviet Russia, I thought it would have been obvious from the beginning that the Secretary of State may authorise a local authority, which is presumably elected, and that this rules out any possibility that I am suggesting that we should go in for the Russian-type of agricultural administration which, it should be appreciated, is very different.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been to see it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: State agriculture does not enter into this. I am not against amalgamations in principle, apart from the one reservation I have made about the preference which should be given to another small unit to make one unit of an economic size.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) spoke about administration. I suggest to him that there are just as many members of local authorities, particularly in rural areas, capable of, and experienced in, the administration of land as are on the Highlands and Islands Development Board or any other board. My own local authorities have a high proportion of members with experience of land management.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I know from my experience of agriculture in the area, and from discussions in the N.F.U., that this is a real need and the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns would be hard put to it to disagree with me on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I found the Minister's argument that paragraph (	<i>e</i>) is incorporated in paragraph (	<i>d</i>) somewhat legalistic and difficult for my legally untrained mind to follow. I did not think it undermined the purpose of my Amendment to amplify anything contained in paragraphs (	<i>a</i>) to (	<i>d</i>). I inserted the word
	<span class='label label-info column'>390</span>
"economic" to make it clear that the purpose is not to perpetuate small and uneconomic units but to give an entry to the agricultural profession. The Amendment should have the support of all hon.
