<div class='page-header'><h1>TOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING (SCOTLAND) BILL [<i>Lords</i>]</h1></div>
<p><i>Question proposed</i> [<i>21st January</i>],
<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee have considered the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Bill [<i>Lords</i>] in relation to the principle of the Bill.â€”[<i>Dr. Dickson Mabon</i>.]</p></blockquote></p>
<p>10.31 a.m.</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to hon. Members for their co-operation at our last Sitting in keeping their contributions so brief and to the point. I have quite a long list of would-be speakers today, so I hope that there will be the same spirit of Scottish reasonableness again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alex Eadie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When we rose on Tuesday I was making some comment on the proposed procedure in Clause 21, Part III of the Bill. My point was that one can sympathise with the Scottish Development Department's methods to relieve itself of the burden of dealing with decisions on appeal. This is usually between the date of submission of an appeal and the date fixed for the inquiry, which is normally a period of two or three months. Thereafter, several more months elapse before the final decision is issued by the Department to the appellant and to the local planning authority.<br><br>
I do not know whether it is the Department's intention to restrict appeals to cases involving minor development only. Even if that is the first intention, I think that, once started, the practice will be to pass more and more to these independent reporters. Nevertheless, it appears to be much better to adhere to the present practice where all reporters' recommendations are submitted to the central office of the Department, where they can be considered in relation to national, regional and area policies and any known future proposals, and also related to previous decisions on appeals concerning identical or very similar types of development.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 54</span>
With the proposed procedure, the independent reporter is not likely to be able to evaluate these factors, with which the Department's officials are familiar in their day-to-day work. The reporters may well reach decisions which conflict with these other factors. Furthermore, it will be more difficult to achieve uniformity than at present if the reporters reach different decisions on dealing with appeals relating to identical or similar proposed developments. It may well happen that a reporter would uphold an appeal for one area, and that another reporter would dismiss an appeal on very similar circumstances for another area, thereby resulting in unfairness to individual appellants.<br><br>
I want to comment on Clause 77, which deals with the local register of planning applications. The present procedure under Section 12(5) of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act, 1947, is that every local planning authority has to keep a register of applications for planning permission as described in paragraph 12 of the Town and Country Planning (General Development) (Scotland) Order, 1950.<br><br>
The register has to contain particulars of the application including the name and address of the applicant, the date of receipt by the local planning authority, a brief description of the development, the decision of the planning authority, and details of any appeal and final decision. Section 12(5) does not authorise anyone other than the applicant to see the application form and plans submitted with the application form, but only the relative entry in the register.<br><br>
The proposed procedure under Clause 77 is for provision to be made by a development order of the Secretary of State for the register of planning applications to be kept in two or more parts, each part containing such information as may be prescribed by the order. The order may also make provision
<br><blockquote><p>"(<i>a</i>) for a specified part of the register to contain copies of applications and any plans or drawings submitted therewith".</p></blockquote>
It is difficult to envisage any type of register of which copies of the plans and drawings are to form part. Many of the plans received with applications are far too unwieldy in size to form part of any such register and, furthermore, in many cases the application is accompanied by a large roll of anything from 15 to 25
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0100">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 55</span>
plans, making it impossible to keep them in a pocket in the register or keep them in any handy form with the register.<br><br>
In those circumstances, should not the present type of register be maintained? If it is intended that a member of the public, a local elector, or any prescribed class of person entitled to see the plans, should call at the planning department, the application form and plans can be exhibited to him over a public counter in the planning department. It would be preferable for these plans to be shown in the planning department so that questions on technical matters can be answered. In the case of Midlothian, the procedure is to pass an application from the County Clerk's office, after recording in the register, to the planning department. Then it goes to the County Surveyor's department and then to the County Engineer's department before being returned to the County Clerk's office, after which it is submitted to the first available meeting of the Planning Committee or Planning Sub-Committee.<br><br>
The proposal to make plans available for public inspection involves the taking up of considerable time in the planning department, with people calling in to see plans, asking questions, and presumably also taking tracings if they so desire.<br><br>
Another point has been suggested by a member of the planning department's staff for Midlothian, namely, that, where an application is current and available for inspection by the general public or even by adjoining owners, it is possible that another architect can ask to see the plans and then appropriate the design for his own use. This is a matter of considerable concern to firms of private architects. Naturally they prefer to safeguard their designs until the proposed building has been completed. In this connection, it is true that architects for adjoining owners are entitled to see detailed plans submitted with a petition for a building warrant to the building authority in the counties and to the Dean of Guild Courts in cities and burghs, but notice of such applications is limited to the adjoining owners, which restricts the number of people and, consequently, architects who are made aware of the petition.<br><br>
I am aware that what I have said leaves me liable to the retort that some
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 56</span>
of my comments would be more appropriate for the Committee stage. However, I have given some thought to the implications of the Bill, and I have involved myself in considerable consultations about it. Perhaps my hon. Friend will be able to find time to reply to some of my points. It may be that that would assist and expedite the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I begin by saying how much I welcomed the open-minded attitude of the Minister of State in saying that he looks forward to receiving suggestions for improving the Bill. No doubt in the course of the later Committee stage we shall be able to test him on that, and I hope that we shall be able to hold him to what he says in respect of a number of points.<br><br>
I was startled by the savage nature of the opposition put forward by the hon. Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. W. Baxter) at our last Sitting, although I agree with him to some extent, particularly when he criticises the introduction of the Bill as being difficult to justify at the present time.<br><br>
I also sympathise with him when he criticises some of the terminology used by planners. All too often, one finds that an old discredited system has been dressed up in new phraseology. "Structure plans" and "action plans" are new examples of the sort of phraseology that we have. In the old days, we had ribbon development, which was thoroughly discredited. That has now been renamed "lineal development", but there is not much difference. We used to have urban sprawls, which were considered to be bad. They are now renamed "garden cities".<br><br>
The argument which took place at our last siting between the hon. Member for West Stirlingshire and the hon. Member for Motherwell (Mr. Lawson) was interesting in as much as it highlights the very real difficulty facing us all. One of them felt that there was too much encroachment on the liberty of the individual, and the other felt that there was not sufficient control over the individual for the good of the community. This emphasises the real difficulty in trying to strike a balance between assuring both the individual and the community as a whole that their interests will be safeguarded.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0101">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 57</span>
Turning to the timing of this Bill, as far as one can see, the justification for such a Measure was very much more urgent in respect of England and Wales than it is for Scotland. The population of England is growing apace. There may be another 15 million people in about 30 years. There was great urgency. In Scotland, however, our population is virtually static. I wonder whether there is the same need to rush ahead with the Bill when we are about to receive the report of the Wheatley Commission, which must affect the regional groupings which we will have, which in turn will affect the Bill's implementation. Could we not take out of the Bill Clause 5, for which there is a desperate need, and implement that as a Bill on its own, while leaving the rest till Wheatley has reported?<br><br>
10.45 a.m.<br><br>
I am pleased to note that one of the Bill's aims is greater public participation. The hon. Member for Midlothian (Mr. Eadie) referred to the public being able to see plans, which I regard as essential in building up public confidence. I would welcome effective steps to remove secrecy from planning, which has often caused anxiety. Will the new procedures do this? Is there not a danger that the very vagueness of the structure plans may raise more objections, perhaps based on false fears? May this not create more extensive areas of blight and mean that local authorities will have to carry out compulsory purchase under Part 4? If they have to buy up many properties which they do not want, perhaps at great cost, this might inhibit them from making worthwhile plans for the future.<br><br>
The best way to eliminate opposition to planning is, I submit, early consultation, which would save time and put at rest many of the fears which underlie objections. Does the Bill provide for this? I can quote an example. I have the honour to be President this year of the Royal and Highland Agricultural Society. Much anxiety was expressed at a recent directors' meeting about what plans could be made in respect of the ground of the Highland Show because of the new plans for the Glasgow-Edinburgh main road and Turnhouse Airport. We tried to get information but were told that the plans were not yet at the stage at which consultation could be useful. I suggest that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 58</span>
it is when plans are being worked on in the early stages that there should be consultation. Thus, not only would local authorities be assisted: it would greatly benefit such bodies as this Society, which could then go ahead with sensible plans.<br><br>
Another worthy aim of the Bill is to streamline and speed up procedures. This is commendable, but will the Bill do it? I visualise staffing as one of the greatest difficulties for local authorities. Does the Minister of State believe that the local authorities have enough personnel of the right calibre to do this work? How many are being trained and coming forward for the future? What consultations has he had or is he having with the universities about filling these posts? Some students in my constituency who wanted to specialise in this field had great difficulty in getting Government grants, while others, possibly art students who may ultimately draw glorious pictures advertising cigarettes, and are making a less essential contribution to the country have little trouble. Could he not keep in closer touch with the universities to encourage those who are needed in the planning departments?<br><br>
We have some lessons to learn in speeding up procedures from Australia, which I visited recently. I was interested to see that, although it is in many ways a much more conservative country, and private enterprise has a far greater sayâ€”no doubt that is why so many people are flocking out thereâ€”at the same time, in planning, they are far more ruthless. Their method is worth consideration, because, combined with their ruthlessness, their compensation is far more generous. This is one of the keys to the problem. Often in the past compensation calculated by district valuers and others has been so low that co-operation has not been forthcoming.<br><br>
The part of the Bill which interests me more than any other is Part V, concerning the preservation of buildings of architectural and historic interest. I have the honour to represent a constituency containing one of the most superb examples of the artistic genius of man in laying out cities. I therefore consider it one of my duties, in concert with others, to act as a guardian of the priceless heritage of Edinburgh in the New Town. Thanks to the controversy the years before last over the ring road, many of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0102">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 59</span>
good citizens of Edinburgh have become active in taking a greater interest in their environment. Many more groups, street associations and others are being formed and more activities developed in existing societies, the Georgian Society and the like, and this is very healthy. If nothing else worthwhile came out of the ring road proposal, at least many people were woken up to take the right kind of notice.<br><br>
One sad feature of past planning procedures is that, although classification of buildings by listing has gone ahead with commendable speed and meticulous care, to the extent that almost anything worthwhile has been provisionally listed, there has been an almost complete lack of logical follow-up with preservation orders where they are needed. My satisfaction at hearing the Minister of State construe Part V as a "blanket preservation order" provision was very great, but we will have to probe hard in Committee to satisfy ourselves that this is so. The reason I say that is that listing of buildings up to now has been mainly provisional, and statutory listing is likely to take a considerable time, because of the intricacies of Scottish law. It may be twenty years or more before all the buildings we want to see statutorily listed are in fact so listed. I am not certain that Part V will cover buildings which are only provisionally listed. If not, I still have many anxieties about the Bill's achievement in this respect.<br><br>
Provisional listing by itself is absurd because the owner is not necessarily informed that his house is "listed", and so does not know that he has to apply for permission to change or demolish it. Some formula must be found so that owners at least are notified of provisional listing.<br><br>
I sometimes wonder whether we take enough interest in the practice of other countries. France has similar problems in preservation and we could learn more from the mistakes and successes of other countries. About a year ago, I sent the Minister of State an interesting pamphlet produced by the French Embassy about the preservation of historic monuments and I hope that he has been able to incorporate some of its suggestions in the Bill.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 60</span>
I appeal to all those societies and bodies concerned with historic buildings to speak up now if they have any practical suggestions for improving the Bill. Past efforts to save individual buildings have often come too late, but we now have a chance to produce meaningful machinery for preservation, and this is the time to get it right. I therefore implore all those bodies based in my constituency or concerned with the New Town of Edinburgh to study this Part of the Bill with the greatest care and let us have their views as soon as possible. If we miss this chance, we may have to wait very many years before there is another opportunity to produce the right legislation, by which time many of the buildings which we want to preserve will be gone.<br><br>
The acid test of whether the Bill will succeed is whether it will encourage local authorities to do the right things more speedily and efficiently, while at the same time safeguarding individual rights and freedoms. To the extent that these two divergent aims are reconcilable, the Committee stage will present us with a formidable challenge.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Planning Acts never make exciting reading, and this latest addition to the race is in no way atypical. It is about as dreary a slab of incomprehensible legal verbiage as I have come across in the last two years. The most cursory glance through it underlines one preliminary point, the need for codification of Scottish planning law. If one chases through Statutes one is involved in a nightmare of tangled references, a jungle of sections and subsections. One has only to look at the Statutes which are being repealed or amended by the Bill to see how complicated the present system is.<br><br>
It has been pointed out to me that Clause 57 contains references to the Local Authorities (Historic Buildings) Act of 1962, but that if one enthusiastically chases back to that Act, one finds that it applies only to England and Wales and one then has to search for the missing link, which turns out to be the Civic Amenities Act of 1967. I have no doubt that there are many other more complex examples of similar confusion.<br><br>
It is suggested that the legal fraternity has an interest in perpetuating this confusion, but that is unfair. Any lawyer
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0103">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 61</span>
that I have known involved in planning appeals would be only too grateful if his task were simplified, and he were given a firm basis to which he could refer and from which he could branch out. When the Bill was introduced in another place it was stated from the Front Bench that the Government realised that the English had codified in 1962 and that it was
<br><blockquote><p>"intended to put work in hand on consolidation as soon as practicable after we have the present Bill on the Statute Book."â€”[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>House of Lords,</i> 14th November, 1968, c. 570.]</p></blockquote>
My heart sinks whenever I hear the phrase "as soon as practicable" uttered by a Government spokesman. I hope that, in this case, there will be a speedy conclusion and that we shall soon see action.<br><br>
11.0 a.m.<br><br>
The Bill is good in that it is well intentioned. We all sympathise with what it is trying to do. However, in planning law there is always a paradox. On the one hand, one tries to streamline procedures and speed up cumbersome machinery and, on the other, one needs to ensure that individual rights are not infringed and that essential safeguards are not eliminated in the interests of administrative expediency. The White Paper eloquently laid out that paradox, which is not easy to escape.<br><br>
Quite often, people come to me who are worried by these procedures. Last Saturday, I saw a man involved in a fairly major planning procedure in the north-east of Scotland. He had tried to lodge his objection by way of what one might call the "layman's common sense" letter, but had been told that this would not do. He was left with a week in which to find a lawyer who would hurry together formal objections, all 30 copies, which would get him into the field when the decision was ultimately taken. We should consider whether the Bill will simplify the procedures and thus help ordinary persons to make their views heard and get their objections, which may not be on a major scale but are important to the individuals concerned, through to those ultimately taking the decisions.<br><br>
I do not object to the basic concept of the structure and local plan. It is an intelligent idea. I shall not repeat what has been said about timing. I accept that there is much to be done and the phasing
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 62</span>
provisions in Clause 2(1) will have to be used with ingenuity. The transitional period will clearly be lengthy. Obviously, these provisions will not come into operation till after we have the Wheatley recommendations.<br><br>
I am worried by the rather casual way in which, in Clauses 1 and 2, we are told that all sorts of other considerations will have to be taken into account by those drawing up the structure plans. It sounds all very well to say that they must look at all the inter-related decisions by other Departmentsâ€”at what is happening economically as well as in local governmentâ€”and that there should be a happy concensus on a long-term plan between the relevant Government Departments, the local authorities and <i>ad hoc</i> planning groups and others with an interest. Obviously, this must be attempted if we are to have a coherent whole in the structure plans. But that is a somewhat pious hope and will often be an empty expectation.<br><br>
I take one local example which is all too topical at the moment. This is the situation in the town of Inverurie. The locomotive works are to be closed finally by the end of 1969, if we can believe the morning Press. There has been a great deal of confusion over this during the last few years. I am trying to envisage the situation in which the local planners would have sat down, two years ago, under the terms of this Bill, to draw up a structure plan. They would have gone to British Railways and the Scottish Office. Perhaps rather naively, they would have looked at the White Paper on Scottish Development up to 1970 with its talk of a "long term future" envisaged for the loco works. With this forecast they would have planned an expanding housing programme. Looking at the whole format, they would have seen a healthy and growing town based, not on an expanding railway works, but certainly on the solid basis of employment provided by the railway works. Then suddenly it all goes and one is left with a gaping hole in the middle of the structure plan.<br><br>
Of course, these things are occasionally inevitable, but they should be minimised, and, if they are to be minimised, one must be confident that, when ones goes to Government Departments, or to hived-off nationalised industries like the railways, one can rely upon their ability to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0104">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 63</span>
produce not possibly a long-term plan but at least some medium-term projections which will allow one to take meaningful structural decisions on the future of one's area.<br><br>
Even leaving aside the monumental opening blunder by the Railways Board in saying that there was a long-term future for the Inverurie works, we know that the situation has been yo-yoing backwards and forwards in an incredible way. In one year, money has been spent on the paint shops, on re-tooling, and equipment in the next, there have been dark mutterings about the future. This sort of thing must make nonsense of any attempt by local planners to carry out their remit under the Bill.<br><br>
If I am to be carried along with this in confidence, I want to know that we are to have the co-operation of organisations like the Railways Board, which does not seem in this case to have been forthcoming. There has been, putting it kindly, a lack of openness which it is difficult to defend plausibly merely in terms of inefficiency. My hon. Friend knows the distress caused by the decision in the north-east of Scotland, and no doubt the Government are taking energetic action to ensure that the prospects of the region, which have been severely damaged, will be restored by the introduction of new industry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the hon. Gentleman of the debate just before Christmas on this matter. Fortunately, there was plenty of time for it, so the Minister of State and others can see exactly what the problem is.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dewar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman. I am trying to relate this case to the planning procedures. I know that my hon. Friend is aware of the Inverurie case and of the absolute necessity, if the decision to close the works is final, of getting new industry into the area to take up the slack of the very rare skilled labour force which exists in that part of Scotland.<br><br>
I come now to Part III of the Bill and the vexed question of the inspectorate. Openly, I thought, my hon. Friend remarked that this was hardly justified in the present situation, and everyone has agreed. I do not think that it will be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 64</span>
justified for a long time, if ever. I do not see any kind of explosion of appeals which would called the inspectorate into operation, given the difficulties of setting it up, but I do not object quite as strongly as some hon. Members to the powers being taken. I thought that the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) was a little optimistic when he talked of the present situation as being entirely satisfactory. I thought I distinguished a touch of professional pride in that part of his speech.<br><br>
There may be technical difficulties in finding the kind of senior advocate needed and persuading him to stay out of courtâ€”at considerable personal sacrifice, if he has a good practiceâ€”and to produce a written report on time in order that a decision can be taken with expedition. Most people are conscientious and, once appointed, will try to bring a matter to a speedy conclusion. But I have heard generalised complaintsâ€”possibly inevitableâ€”from quarters which seem to know something about it, that this does not always happen as quickly as on might hope or expect.<br><br>
On the other hand, I do not think that there will be need for the inspectorate because of the general trend in the Bill, which I welcome, to move appeals from central Administration to the new local government units. This will be a continuing trend and it is right that the Scottish Development Department, with all its responsibilities, should, to some extent, be unclutteredâ€”if this is not too ungallant a termâ€”with the removal of some of these appeals. But, of course, we must be carefulâ€”and I appreciate the hon. and learned Gentleman's pointâ€”when objections are made to local pleas we do not end up with local authorities acting as judge and jury in their own causes.<br><br>
If that also worries the hon. and learned Member, he will remember that the same point was given considerable local prominence at the time of the English legislation. This arose over the Government's attitude to the question of appeals after a local authority had turned down permission for the erection of hoardings to carry advertisements. The advertising industry has not a particularly popular image, particularly on this side of the Committee, but this case is worth
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0105">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 65</span>
mentioning because a point of principle is involved and I have not been entirely happy about the idea that a local planning authority, having turned down an application, should now be asked to look at it again and sit as the court of appeal on its own action. It is a dangerous precedent. I was glad that the Outdoor Advertising Association suggested a compromise because everyone accepts that these appeals should not be left to lie around on the files at St. Andrew's House for too long which may be the tendency with the present pressure on the Development Department. The Association suggested local tribunals of some sort, possibly a panel of local lawyers. However, that does not commend itself 100 per cent. to me and I would prefer to widen the membership and dilute the legal expertise a little. But certainly a local panel would be a possibility, because the number of appeals coming up will surely be limited.<br><br>
What are Government thinking about this? Do they intend to continue their plans to divest the Secretary of State of his responsibilities in this matter? Presumably, the English and Scottish regulations would be brought in at the same time and I would be interested in the Minister of State's comments.<br><br>
I share the interest of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North (Earl of Dalkeith) in Part V, which is a matter of great importance. I, too, represent a constituency with a high proportion of listed buildings. I shall make a frank admission in saying that one of the problems of this Bill is that one is not necessarily aware of what all the previous provisions were.<br><br>
I am particularly interested in Clauses 41 and 42. It has been suggested to me by people in Aberdeen connected with planning that they could have an unfortunate effect. They provide that, where a listed building consent has been refused, and if, as a result, a building cannot be put to reasonably beneficial use, the owner may require the local authority to purchase it. Or, if the use has been inhibited and financial loss been incurred by refusal of consent, compensation must be payable. In an area where there is a large number of listed buildings, it has been suggested to me that there is a danger that local
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 66</span>
authorities will be influenced by the fact that, if they refuse applications, they may be faced with a whopping Bill for compulsory purchase or for compensation. The situation could arise in which they will feel inhibited from stepping in to preserve amenity or architectural heritage in certain cases because of the risk of financial commitment.<br><br>
11.15 a.m.<br><br>
To take an example, we have a major decision pending in Aberdeen about the redevelopment of the new market, which is a listed building with an excellent classical facade. The proposal is for a new building on the site extending out over the East Green. This is under discussion at present. There are objectors who feel that it would destroy the unity of that part of the city if the plan went ahead. I have a great deal of sympathy with those objectors, and I fear that it would weigh very much with the local authority if it knew that, if it put up a successful objection in such a situation and consent were not given for the development, it would probably face a large bill on the ground that the promoters had lost heavily, as, no doubt, they would, if they were prevented from redeveloping on the lines which they wanted. I mention that example in passing to illustrate the point which will, I am sure, have to be discussed carefully in Committee.<br><br>
On the whole, this is a useful Bill. There is much in it which will be of advantage in the future, for example, Clause 60â€”the special inquiriesâ€”which, though probably seldom used, will be a useful power to have in reserve, and Clause 64â€”the five-year limit on a planning permissionâ€”which, on a superficial reading, I suspect will have a considerable effect on the habits of speculative builders, certainly in the west of Scotland.<br><br>
There are all sorts of excellent ideas in the Bill, and I support it in general outline. It is not a Measure which will be of much comfort to those of us who believe in conflict politics; it will not give rise to a great confrontation between the two sides of the House, though it is, perhaps, none the worse for that. It makes a limited contribution to the evolution of planning law in Scotland. I suspect, without much pleasure, that there will be a long and hard Committee stage, but I hope that we may at least
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0106">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 67</span>
in some directions be able usefully to widen its scope.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with many of the points made by the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Dewar), particularly his comments on the unexpected difficulties which can confront an area such as Inverurie where there has been a change in the economic situation, for example, the closure of a locomotive works orâ€”as in my caseâ€”the closure of a coal mine. I hope that our deliberations on the Bill will, if they do nothing more, lay down guidelines for further preparatory work in this respect and do something to obviate the difficulties which have arisen in Scotland during the past few years.<br><br>
For a Bill expressing such good intentions, I have seldon seen one which had such a cool reception from all hon. Members of the Committee. I am sure that it will call for a <i>tour de force</i> by the Minister, in his usual way, to make it appear the lion which he obviously thinks it is. There are, however, many worthy objectives expressed in the Bill and I hope that it will help Scotland in the longer term.<br><br>
The consolidation provisions are welcome. Sometimes, when we have a new and apparently complicated Measure before us, resistance is built up among hon. Members because they feel that it will be difficult to put into practice. I hope that the Minister will help to allay these fears when he winds up.<br><br>
I come now to my first question on the practical operation of the Bill. How will it help planning on the ground in practice? The first reason given for the Bill in the White Paper Cmnd. 3333 was that planning had become overloaded. I do not believe that this is so in Scotland, and I think that my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) cleared that matter up on Tuesday.<br><br>
Second, how will the Bill help local authority members? It will be the elected members of local authorities who will have to implement it, and we must think of them as well as of the general public in our deliberations. I am sure that the Planning Advisory Group, when it prepared the White Paper or the basis for it, was certain that the Royal Com-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 68</span>
mission would have reported before the stage of this legislation was reached. In fact, however, we do not know on what type of body we shall put responsibility for this Measure. Are we considering a planning committee of the usual 15, 20 or 30 members? Are we considering a top or bottom tier authority? The whole thing is in the melting pot, and this will make our consideration of the Bill rather more difficult than I should like.<br><br>
How will the Bill help planning officers? They are doing a wonderful job, they are probably at full stretch, and their departments are always short of staff. Where will the new staff come from, and how will they implement these plans quickly? I judge from the Minister's sense of urgency in wanting to get the Bill through that he hopes for action soon, before the Wheatley Committee recommendations can be put into effect.<br><br>
We must accept, as a generalisation, that planning in Scotland works, and in adding a substantial load to the planning committees we must be very careful in what we do. Is the Bill necessary in Scotland at this moment? Is this the right time? It is vital to have the answers on the Royal Commission before we come to final decisions. I accept that, in the Central Belt, as so often in the pastâ€”for example, in regard to water supplies and sewerageâ€”legislation is urgently required, but throughout the great rural areas of Scotland there is not the urgency to bring forward new legislation.<br><br>
Day-to-day planning, on which most of the effort really goes, is working at present, and, as I said, I pay tribute to the planning committees and planning officers who do this good work. It is important to bear in mind that, contrary to the trend indicated by the White Paper, the number of planning appeals is falling. If the Minister does not like my saying that the trend there is falling, perhaps I should say that the number of planning decisions is falling, as indicated in the last S.D.D. Report. I do not, therefore, consider that there is the urgency which the Minister calls upon us to recognise in discussing the Bill.<br><br>
We should put a lot of emphasis on the Bill in the context of day-to-day planning. It is here that so much can be done for Scotland in raising the standard
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0107">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 69</span>
of design and architecture in the whole country. We must give a positive lead to planning committees. It is not just a matter of saying, "No" to this or to that. A lead must be given in saying why one says "No" and how things ought to be improved. This is the aspect of the Bill which we must constantly bear in mind.<br><br>
As the hon. Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. W. Baxter) said, one or two strong characters on a planning committee can lead in the right directionâ€”â€”</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Baxter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Or the wrong one.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>:â€”or the wrong direction, and it is important that we give a positive lead in the right way, to raise the standard of design and architecture in Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Baxter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman see in the Bill any suggestions whereby the right road will be travelled in that respect?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am talking at the moment about local plans, and I am apprehensive. I do not consider that the guidelines in this direction are strong enough. There is much that is good in Scotland, that is commended by the Saltire Society, the Civic Trust, and so on, not only in public buildings but in hydroelectric schemes, for example, in which the Board has done a first-class job. But, at the same timeâ€”my goodnessâ€”how much is really bad in Scotland. As one drives about the country, one becomes thoroughly depressed at what one sees at timesâ€”unfinished housing schemes, unfinished in the sense that they do not go the whole way with landscaping, layout, recreation centres, playing fields, community centres, and so on.<br><br>
All these things go to make up the sort of planning which I want to see in Scotland, but so often they fall down on finance. So much of good planning is a matter of having the money available for good quality materials and good quality design. I hope that we shall give encouragement to local authorities in that way.<br><br>
Planning on the massive scale, the structure planning with which we are so
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 70</span>
much concerned in Scotland now, is virtually stuffed full of plans which we never seem to discuss and which never come into effect. I think of the plans different standing. But the plans seem Moray Firth, the Clyde, the Borders. All these areas have produced plans prepared by bodies of different kinds and of diffeent standing. But the plans seem merely to lie on the table and nothing happens. I should like to have debates in this Grand Committee on some of these plans and see action taken. I am worried lest we multiply the number of plans yet not see results of benefit to Scotland coming from the effort which goes into them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman mentioned West Lothian. What is the plan to which he refers on which work has not been done?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I said that we have not seen great action. I have seen the great plan for West Lothian, a very fine document, and I look forward to hearing and seeing the results.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Dr. J. Dickson Mabon)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Results are already there to be seen.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should not talk nonsense. A great deal of work has been done on the plan, and it is being pursued by the West Lothian Planning Committee and other bodies. The hon. Member is talking rubbish and ought to withdraw that remark.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to know that something is happening somewhere, but I could mention other plans on which early action is not taking place. I am not criticising the Government or the planning authorities. I am saying that there are many plans, but not as much takes place as one would like to see.<br><br>
Under the Bill, the Scottish Development Department will be calling for new structure plans often similar in history to the development plans which have been worked on so carefully in the past. Here again, one wonders whether we are having to face the problem of the structure plan through the Development Department because there is not in England anything quite equivalent to the Scottish Development Department, which has done such valuable work over recent years.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0108">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 71</span>
As regards the local plans and action plans, the great difficulty for the authorities which will have to do the planning lies in anticipation, and anticipation which will not cause excessive planning blight. Could one have said two or three years ago that, for example, the Ross-shire Council could have planned for the aluminium smelter at Inver-gordon? Could one plan, for example, for Hunterstone two or three years before it took place? It is difficult for local authorities to plan for major schemes before they are likely to take place. So often, these schemes come out of the blue, and there are then alterations to the development plan. No delay is caused, but I am worried lest, if we have detailed structure plans, we shall greatly increase planning blight and arouse a good deal of local opposition.<br><br>
I strongly welcome the Minister's view that there should be greater participation with local people in the plans for their own area. I hope that this idea will move smoothly to a conclusion. I can see great difficulties ahead, as many hon. Members do. After all, the chairman of the planning committee will have to explain the plans from the chair to those who are interested, and yet, at the same time, he will be the chief witness, and in the end he will be the judge in drawing up conclusions from the meeting. I wonder whether that is the right procedure to produce the right results.<br><br>
Now, one or two detailed points. I share the view of all hon. Members that we should not have a system of full-time reporters. I think that the present system works wellâ€”and all credit to those who have done the reporting. If we are to give the responsibility for making a final report to a reporter, he should not be called a reporter, because a reporter must report to somebody. If he does not report to anybody, this is the wrong terminology. Perhaps we should call him a commissioner, or something else.<br><br>
11.30 a.m.<br><br>
Is what is proposed in Clause 38 a further restriction on the sale of council houses?<br><br>
I am interested in Clause 80 dealing with tree preservation orders. There is a difficulty with which all of us who love the countryside are concerned. If
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 72</span>
a council makes a tree preservation order it is liable for the financial consequences. If one big oak tree is concerned, that is all right, but if a whole wood, which may be an important feature of the landscape surrounding a town, is concerned, the local authority might well have to pay compensation for the whole wood. This is too heavy a burden to place on small local authorities. I hope that we shall consider this point in Committee.<br><br>
I hope, too, that we shall consider very carefully in Committee the powers of statutory undertakers. They are often the rogue elephants of planning. They have a very much greater right than the average resident to put through their plans. I hope that local residents will have the same right of participation in the activities of statutory undertakers, by which I mean British Rail, the electricity and gas undertakings, and so on, as they have in ordinary local plans. Frequently a power transmission line or a gasworks can have a much more detrimental effect on an area than a housing development.<br><br>
I am sure that we shall have a most interesting and detailed Committee stage and that the worthy objectives will in the end produce a worthy Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Doig</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish, first, to deal with one or two points which are not in the Bill in the hope of persuading the Minister of State to do something about covering them by Amendments.<br><br>
Conditions are imposed by a feu superior on a feu. A person may apply for planning permission which is granted, but the feu superior has over the development a power of veto which is not subject to any form of appeal. It is wrong that we should allow such a situation to continue. This can apply in all sorts of ways and frequently even bring hardship. A widow living in a reasonably sized house who has not been left a great deal of money by her husband may decide that she wants to convert it and to take in a few boarders in order to be able to keep the house and herself. The local planning committee may have no objection because there are similar establishments alongside, but the feu superior can say, "I will not allow it, because this is not provided for in the feu charter. It distinctly says that the property is to be used purely for residential purposes". No appeal can be made against his decision. He may say, "If you take in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0109">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 73</span>
boarders, you change the use of the property and it then constitutes a boarding-house".<br><br>
An area may have been a purely residential area when a feu there was granted. A couple of hundred years later the area may have changed to a commercial or business area. The feu superior can refuse to allow people to sell to someone who proposes to change the nature of the use of the property to the present use in the area and to turn it into a commercial enterprise. A person may be compelled to stay in an area which is no longer suitable for residential purposes simply because he cannot sell the premises since they cannot be changed into business or commercial premises. This power of veto over planning permission by a feu superior is wrong and should be removed.<br><br>
I turn to another problem which I have experienced in my constituency recently. In a housing scheme planned by the local corporation it was proposed to put a public house alongside a multistorey block of houses. Everybody knows that this is bad planning. If it were proposed to do this after the houses were occupied, the people in the houses would lodge objection. But planning permission is given in principle to build the public house before there are any tenants in the area. Therefore, the tenants cannot object because they are not there. They do not even know whether they will get a house there. There is no means of preventing planning permission for the public house, although everybody would like to prevent it. This situation has happened in my constituency recently, on more than one occasion I may say, and it is liable to happen again. Some effort should be made to prevent it.<br><br>
I came across other problems while I was a member of a planning committee. Every member of a planning committee has to earn his livelihood outside. He is only a part time member, or a more appropriate description might be, a spare time member, of a council. To suggest that such a person can examine plans in detail before a planning decision is taken is utter nonsense; it cannot be done. I know this because I have conscientiously tried to do it. One may find on the agenda an application for planning per-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 74</span>
mission for a new development. One says to the town clerk, "I want to see the plans". He then spreads the plans out. One gets about ten seconds to look at them. To suggest that a layman can make a proper decision on a plan in that period is rubbish. After the scheme is built, one finds that there are greater spaces between the drains than there used to be and therefore flooding is caused in the streets. The camber of the road may be less than it used to be and again there is flooding in the street. Such a situation is prevalent in my area and possibly in other people's areas.<br><br>
When one complains afterwards one is told, "But you were on the committee that passed the plans". I can visualise only one way in which this difficulty can be overcome. The plans should be subject to checking or examination by an expert outside the town planning officer's staff who draw up the plans. A member of his staff would be very hesitant about criticising his boss.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was also a member of a planning committee. Would my hon. Friend agree that the members of the planning committee and the local authority have power to deal with officials who have obviously misled the committee?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doig</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I have done this. We passed a motion that in future any departure from previous practice was to be drawn to the attention of the committee. I had to do this to safeguard my local authority. This must be happening in other local authorities where no one has taken the trouble to pass a motion of this kind.<br><br>
We have only to look at the results. Dampness in houses exists in every housing scheme of which I know. There may be a new scheme of 2,000 or 3,000 houses. Within months there will be complaints about dampness, condensation, badly designed windows which cannot be closed, and all sorts of other things. For a member of a planning committee to detect such faults is utterly impossible.<br><br>
A new system of checking must be devised which will overcome this difficulty. The only one of which I can think is that plans should be subject to expert
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0110">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 75</span>
examination by someone outside the control of the person who drew up and presented the plans.<br><br>
I leave these points with the Minister of State in the hope that he will try to devise means of overcoming these real problems.<br><br>
Clause 39 deals with buildings of historic interest which cannot be demolished except in certain circumstances. Every speaker has supported the Clause and advocates even tighter control. My view is exactly the opposite. While I was on a local authority I frequently experienced difficulties because of the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act, 1947, which held up highly desirable developments which everybody wanted. The most fantastic situations arose. I should like to give two examples.<br><br>
In Dundee we have a castle called Mains Castle. It is literally falling to bits. It is so dangerous that we have had to put a large fence round the perimeter to prevent people from being struck by pieces of masonry which might fall on them. The castle is inside a public park. Children climb the fence, get in the grounds and start fires inside. We asked for permission to demolish the castle. It was refused. It is of no value architecturally or otherwise. We were told that we could not demolish it. If we even touched it, the provision about having to restore it to its original state might well apply. To restore it to its original state would cost a fortune because it has been in existence for hundreds of years. It takes up valuable space in a public park. It prevents people from using part of the park as it has to be fenced off because of the danger resulting from its state. The Corporation will not go to the expense of restoring it because that would be very costly. We cannot knock it down. It must be left till the kids gradually pull it apart, thus endangering their lives, or till it falls down in a few more hundred years. The people who say that we cannot knock it down are not prepared to pay anything towards its preservation. The poor ratepayers and the local authority must pay for it. It is of no interest to them. The majority of them do not want it, although there will be a few cranks who do.<br><br>
Another castle in my constituency is Dudhope Castle. It is a very out of date
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 76</span>
building with a very low roof. It is like Nelson's "Victory" in the sense that people hit their heads on the roof if they stand up straight. Cycling clubs use it for meetings. Pipe bands and all sorts of organisations gather in this very sub-standard accommodation. We wanted to knock down this castle, but we were not allowed to do so. There was an outcry. Eventually, because it is still used, we had to spend a considerable sum of money, not on preserving it, but merely on making it safe. To bring it up to date would cost far more than to build a completely new building which would provide modern, up-to-date accommodation for all these organisations. Instead, we are left with this old eyesore which we are not permitted to knock down. It has no great value. There is nothing unusual about it. Hundreds of other castles have much greater value historically and otherwise in Scotland. We are stuck with this castle. The Bill will make it even less likely that we shall be able to knock it down.<br><br>
The Secretary of State should retain the power of planning appeal. As a former member of a planning committee, I know that time and again members have wished to object and knew that their objections would be carried if they did but for the fact that the town clerk has said, "We have had similar cases before, Every time they have gone to appeal we have lost, so you had better accept this". That is the sole reason why they were passed. Many would have been refused for bad planning reasons. It seems to me that there ought to be this power to appeal to the Secretary of State or to some other body which has nothing to do with the planning committee concerned, and which is competent to take these decisions. It is wrong to have a committee which can make decisions without having to give proper reasons, as it has to at present. If committees are not obliged to give proper reasons, developments will be blocked for reasons which have nothing to do with planning.<br><br>
11.45 a.m.<br><br>
This consolidation of planning Acts is very necessary, as I have advocated before. Legislation should be consolidated so that it can be readily understood, and in the case of planning it is probably more desirable than anything else.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Sir John Gilmour</span><span class='membercontribution'>: While we welcome the Minister of State's words about being willing to change and improve the Bill, it is difficult to see how any alteration can be made to Part I dealing with structure and local plans.<br><br>
The points which my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) made are underlined, for example, by a report which, no doubt, most hon. Members will have received, on the possible industrial developments in the Clyde estuary. There are a lot of suggestions in the report for dealing with an area which at present covers five or six planning authoritiesâ€”â€”</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Dickson Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Nine, in fact.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir J. Gilmour</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the course of discussions on it, I suspect that a great many entrenched positions will build up in various quarters, and a good deal of shoving will occur as to which parts of the plan should be implemented. I find it difficult to believe that local planning authorities will have any say in it at all. The structure plan will be taken out of their hands. It may be that the Bill is drafted so that, although it refers to "local planning authority" in Clause 1, it does not mean the nine planning authorities. By the time that the Bill is passed, there may have been changes, and the local planning authorities will not be these nine. However, I find it difficult to believe that the nine will be amalgamated into one in time for decisions to be taken. It is unfortunate that we are considering Part I at the present time, because we are likely to pass legislation which will not match up to the situation which we shall face in implementing documents of this kind.<br><br>
In east Fife, in one part of the county, we are tied up with the development of Tayside, which depends on decisions taken in Dundee, Angus and Perth. In other parts of the county we are tied up with the Edinburgh area. A few days ago, a report was published advocating building another bridge across the Forth. All these decisions are taken out of the hands of the planning authorities.<br><br>
The only feature in Part I that I can welcome is that relating to local plans. As areas get bigger, whether decisions are taken by the Scottish Development Department, the Secretary of State, or
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 78</span>
any other body which may be set up, when it comes to implementing them it is essential for local people to have a say in how the structure plan fits into their environment and the effect that it has on them. That is why it is right that St. Andrews should be one of the two small burghs which are to be their own planning authorities. The people in St. Andrews are prepared to accept that the size of the university will be decided by Parliament and through the University Grants Committee. They are prepared to fit into that. But when it comes to the development of St. Andrews, the people should have a say. I think that the Secretary of State held three inquiries about possible developments in South Street, St. Andrews, before it could be established where extensions should take place. The people of St. Andrews accept that there must be more buildings, but it is right that they should have a say in how they should take place in their community.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The parallel of St. Andrews and the other authorities is rather interesting, because St. Andrews appoints consultants. It does not follow that the St. Andrews town council always accepts what the consultants say. It is entitled to pay consultants, but it is not compelled to adopt their recommendations. In the case of the Metra report, the nine planning authorities paid for a large proportion of that study, and they are entitled to make their own decisions. The same applies to the Freeman Fox report. Again, all the authorities are entitled to accept or reject the advice of their consultants. I cannot understand why the hon. Gentleman complains about that. I should have thought that it was a sensible way to proceed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir J. Gilmour</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is all very well for the hon. Gentleman to say that the planning authorities can reject or accept the advice which they receive. However, if the people on the south side of the Forth accept the consultants' advice as to where the bridge should go and those on the north reject it, the Secretary of State has to decide. It is a delusion to think that the planning authorities have that authority.<br><br>
The case of St. Andrews is different. It is agreed that the university has to expand and, quite rightly, the town has the chance to have a say, as do private
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0112">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 79</span>
individuals in the town, about how it should be fitted into their environment.<br><br>
Several hon. Members were rather harsh in their comments about local planning, but one has only to look at North Street and South Street in St. Andrews to see how beautifully they are laid out. The New Town area of Edinburgh, too, illustrates how local interests have designed and laid it out extremely well.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. James Davidson) referred to the iniquities of the feuing system. If it had not been for that system, we should not have had the fine towns and villages which exist in Scotland. We should be chary of saying that everything is wrong with feuing. It has done a great deal for Scotland's architecture, and it allows private individuals to play some part in planning.<br><br>
How is it possible to dovetail the work of other authorities into planning? In reply to a Question yesterday by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Springburn (Mr. Buchanan), the President of the Board of Trade announced four advance factories for Scotland. Listening to the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Dewar), one would think that Inverurie was the place which should have an advance factory. How does the siting of advance factories by the Board of Trade tie in with the local planning authorities, which are beavering away to build up the resources of their areas? How does it work?<br><br>
Clause 1 talks about fitting in transportation, for example, but so many local planning authorities have little say about transportation. About eighteen months ago I went with my constituents to complain about the service given them by British Railways across the Tay Bridge to the north of Fife. The Transport Users' Consultative Committee agreed that there was a case to answer about the quality of service which was rendered. However, when we went to the hearing, the spokesman for British Railways announced that they intended to discontinue the service altogether. We still had the hearing, but it was a complete waste of time. How are we to bring in British Railways and the air services in making these decisions? We now have pro-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 80</span>
posals to discontinue services on the main line between Edinburgh, Kinross and Perth. They have come out of the blue. Presumably, until a short time ago, they were unknown by the planning authorities of Kinross and Perth.<br><br>
Air services obviously play a big part in the development of life, industry and commerce in every district. In the Tay-side area we have been fortunate. After arguments going back over many years about whether Leuchars could be used as an air terminal, at last the Ministry of Defence has said that it may be. Suddenly we are provided with an aerodrome with a first-class runway. At the same time, 35 miles away, we have Turn-house, and an argument raging about whether there should be a second runway there. In view of the fact that Edinburgh goes on strike and Leuchars does not, there is something to be said for diverting all traffic to Leuchars. However, presumably that situation will not go on for ever.<br><br>
In bringing forward new planning procedure, is it not possible to achieve better co-operation between the planning of road, rail and air facilities with the local authorities? At the moment the railways are entitled to work on their own. No one has the right to say what should happen. When the ordinary individual complains, under present legislation the only right that he has in going to the Transport Users' Consultative Committee is to talk about hardship to himself or his family. He cannot say that he knows that a factory is to be developed in two years' time or that he has plans to build this or that. It is quite outside the scope of the individual to put forward such matters in looking after his railway services.<br><br>
I disagree with what the hon. Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Doig) said about historic buildings. In the <i>Glasgow Herald</i> today there is a picture of the Town Hall in Greenlaw. Apparently it was to be pulled down, but it has been saved. That underlines the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North (Earl of Dalkeith) that buildings can be listed as being of special architectural or historic interest, but that, if they do not carry the statutory requirement not to knock them down, before we know where we are, they have gone. In England, it

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 81</span>
has been found necessary to produce the Redundant Churches and other Religious Buildings Bill to take churches out of the provisions of England's planning legislation. I am wondering whether the Secretary of State thinks that he will have to bring forward a similar Measure for Scotland.<br><br>
I hope that we shall be able to improve the Bill, but I have great doubts about Part I.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may be helpful if I explain to hon. Members that, in agreement with the Minister, I shall extend the Sitting to 1.15 in the hope that I have the privilege of calling rather more hon. Members, as many as possible. I shall call the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Gordon Campbell) to wind up for the Opposition at 12.30. There are still another four hon. Members who wish to speak.</span></p>
<p>12 noon.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. J. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Many of my colleagues have apologised for not having legal minds, but we need not, since we have had practical experience on planning committees. When the 1947 Act was introduced, most local authorities felt that it was a major step forward. There is now a great crusade for participation, which, when expressed by some of my hon. Friends, seems to mean any view which is not contrary to their own. The same seems to apply to local authorities. My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Doig) illustrated many of the problems of the 1947 Act and no doubt we could all stay here till one o'clock in the morning putting forward objections to, and congratulations upon, that Act.<br><br>
I am in favour of the structure plan proposal, but does it mean that, when the plan is submitted to the Secretary of State, it will be on a regional or a local basis? If it is the latter, it will give local people the participation which the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North (Earl of Dalkeith) mentioned.<br><br>
We are talking about vesting much more power in the planning officer and his assistants. Even within the present legislation, forward looking local authorities are giving more autonomy to these officers, but the officers, like school teachers, cannot be obtained. This puts local authorities in a difficult situation.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 82</span>
The Bill will do nothing about something which happens every day in different local authorities. I refer for example to people wanting planning permission to build a shop, being turned down by a planning committee, and, lacking the necessary know-how to contact a solicitor, feeling aggrieved. The situation is complicated when a similar proposal is put forward later and accepted by the planning committee. If the right of appeal to the Secretary of State is removed, I assume that we will vest too much power in the local authorities, without allowing applicants to put forward their views.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, West made a valid point about feu superiors. I do not want to bore the Committee by relating the number of occasions on which I have been involved as a local councillor or as a Member of Parliament over this archaic legislation. I ask my hon. Friend to pay attention to this. When the feu superior can dictate not only to the local authority but to the Government this should be seriously considered and perhaps made the subject of legislation.<br><br>
There are also problems over gypsies. I hope that some provision can be made in the Bill to advise local authorities to set aside areas for them and so help to deal with a serious situation. At present, anyone going with a caravan on to a site where it is not allowed is moved on by the police; then the same process ought to be applied to the next man, the next day. If the Bill made it clear that certain areas were sacrosanct and that local authorities had power immediately to deal with the general situation instead of every particular incident, matters would be greatly improved, and much of the pressure would be eliminated.<br><br>
I am also concerned about the designation of reporters, who are doing a valuable job. To try to make them full time is not the proper approach. I hope that my hon. Friend will decide, on the basis of the views expressed, that the <i>Status quo</i> should be maintained. I very much favour the Bill, because the 1947 Act requires many modifications, on the basis of experience.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Younger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I also welcome the Government's good intentions in bringing in the Bill, since the time is ripe
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0114">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 83</span>
for a careful further look at our planning procedures. I agree with the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Dewar) that this is one of the many Bills which this Committee considers which are not the subject of inter-party controversy, but we should understand that there can be controversy between hon. Members and the Government of the day, of whichever complexion.<br><br>
Many hon. Members have said that, although the Bill is welcome, it is by no means totally satisfactory. If anyone thinks that I am being churlish in giving the Bill a half-hearted welcome I invite him to imagine what a torrent of criticism there would have been from the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) if such a Bill, with this timing, had been produced by our Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There was a planning Bill produced by the hon. Member's Governmentâ€”he would not remember, because it was before his timeâ€”which was a United Kingdom Bill, every Clause of which was applied to Scotlandâ€”and in almost no more than a sentence. There was a great uproar and we kept the Committee sitting for several meetings because of the completely haphazard and scandalous manner in which that Government treated Scottish legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Younger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am always grateful for the right hon. Gentleman reminiscences which are some of the most charming things we have in the Committee, and now he has made my point. That is exactly what would have happened if we had introduced a Bill like this. Therefore, I am not being churlish. We are entitled to detailed criticism of how the Bill has been brought in.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a good Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Younger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is particularly welcome for the layman, because our present system is not completely satisfactory. We can all think of good planning, but more than half the planning is unsatisfactory in appearance. I do not wish to knock the appearance of our country, but the average Scottish town leaves much to be desired. Planning has been unsatisfactory generally over the last twenty years or more. We should criticise the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 84</span>
standard picture of the old main street, parts of it in disrepair, with hastily built estates on the perimeter, some lacking shape and form and many of the houses not aesthetically designed. I do not criticise those who worked hard on themâ€”the need for more houses has been so desperate that there is every excuseâ€”but this is a fair point when renewing our planning legislation.<br><br>
We have all seen detailed examples of things that have gone wrong. A tiny one of which I know illustrates some of the infections of the system. A multistorey car park was erected in the centre of Glasgow a few years ago. When I used it for the first time I discovered that this seven-storey building had been built without a lift. It is beyond belief that a system which can produce such an example can be right.<br><br>
12.15 p.m.<br><br>
I welcome the recognition of transport problems and that they must be taken into account in future, because this has been a tremendous gap in planning. There are examples concerning the use of at present disused railway lines in our citiesâ€”for example the Glasgow low level line. I do not believe that our planning system was able to look ahead sufficiently in these matters.<br><br>
On Tuesday, the hon. Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. W. Baxter) mentioned some of the planning decisions in the town of Stirling. I cannot believe that a planning system is right under which there are such lengthy delays, lasting often for many years, over the provision of an inner relief road in Stirling, with the result that there are appalling traffic jams every busy day in summer in the town. One cannot blame any individual. It is just that the planning system has resulted in such delay, which constitutes another reason for putting it right.<br><br>
I welcome the Bill and the idea of structure plans and of having local plans under them. On the whole, it is right that the more information we can give and the earlier we can give it, the better. It raises difficulties, and possibly to some extent we may increase possible opposition to a plan by giving it longer to build up. That is a risk we must accept. The more we take the general public into our confidence, the better it will be in the long run.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0115">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 85</span>
However, having welcomed the Bill, I must say that it has been produced at a time which does not enable us to scrutinise, at least, the machinery by which it will work. I understand the Minister's position. He desires to bring in the Bill but the Wheatley Commission has taken so much longer than expected to make its reportâ€”and I blame no one for that: it is more important that the report should be right than hasty. But the situation makes this a difficult task for us. It is not good enough to say that these provisions will be all right when the Wheatley report comes out.<br><br>
We all assume that we know roughly what the Wheatley Commission will recommend, but it is perfectly possible that it will make recommendations which none of us expect. We should then be in the position of having passed a Bill which, if the Wheatley recommendations should be substantially different from what we had expected, will become nonsense, because its only chance of working well is through having the larger regional units which we expect to emerge from the recommendations of the Wheatley Commission. I hope that the Minister of State recognises this point, and will undertake that, even if we must have the Committee stage within the following weeks, the Report stage will not take place till after the Wheatley Commission has reported, since there may well be alterations which we should like to make to the Bill in the light of the Wheatley recommendations.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Mackintosh) gave a telling description on Tuesday of the procedure likely to take place in local planning authorities following this Bill. I hope that the Minister will recognise these problems by holding out some hope that we shall have a chance to discuss the details of the Bill after we know what Wheatley recommends.<br><br>
There is, for example, the question of the provision of staff to carry out these changes in planning law. It is not enough to say that the work will be done by local planning officers in some sort of regions or areas which we think will be in position then. These changes in law and practice will require highly qualified staffâ€”and I mean not only planning officers but qualified economists and transport experts and others. It is essen-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 86</span>
tial that such people should be in on the formulation of structure plans. They cannot be under the present system. We must, however, be assured that such high quality staff will be available and ready full-time to work on structure plans.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North (Earl of Dalkeith) referred to planning blight, and this aspect affects most of our constituencies most often, because it creates hardship. The possibility of improving and speeding up planning in future lies in the critical factor of convincing people that, when they are affected by planning decisions, they will, as of right and without difficulty, get adequate compensation.<br><br>
It goes aginst the grain of many of us, particularly as public money is involved, that some people involved in planning decisions make a packet out of it. I do not believe this happens often, but even if it occasionally happens, it is well worth such occasional happenings in order to speed up the process. The Government should be far more relaxed in their attitude when an area is affected and should go to owners or occupiers of the premises concerned and say, "We do not want a lot of legal procedures and to go to compulsory purchase. Here is a really good offer to enable you to settle quickly." I believe that the cost to public funds in the end would probably be much less because it would save time, trouble, delay, legal fees and the rest. There is a certain ethical rectitude in the present attitude because we may think that people are sometimes making money when their property is taken over, but most people affected by planning decisionsâ€”when their homes are pulled down, for exampleâ€”suffer considerable hardship and disturbance to their lives, and this should be recognised easily and without trouble.<br><br>
I reinforce what has been said by many hon. Members about appeals. It might work satisfactorily, but it is unacceptable to have a system whereby a local authority is judge and jury in its own cause. One accepts that local authorities would try to use their powers in a reasonable manner, but one could not expect the public, particularly when affected by planning decisions, to accept that their appeals should be decided by the persons who had rejected their cases in the first instance.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0116">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 87</span>
Lord Hughes, in another place, when asked for details about the proposed inspectorate, made a remarkable statement. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Simply because of the fact that we do not expect to be using this machinery unless things change very radically in the next few years, I would be reluctant to predict the sort of individual who will be appointed to take decisions on these matters â€¦".â€”[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>House of Lords,</i> 28th November, 1968; Vol. 297, c. 1334.]</p></blockquote>
He went on in that vein, and that is an unsatisfactory way for us to be presented with legislation. We are presented with a new method of hearing appeals and with power to appoint a new inspectorate. Yet we are told that it is not necessary to tell usâ€”â€”</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At this timeâ€”â€”</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Younger</span><span class='membercontribution'>:â€”at this time the sort of people who will be called upon to do the work. This is asking for a blank cheque on the future, which is quite wrong. The hon. Gentleman should either justify the need for inspectors or withdraw this provision.<br><br>
I am grateful to the Government for bringing in the Bill. I hope the hon. Gentleman will give an assurance that it will not complete its passage through the House before there is a chance for us at least to see in outline the recommendations of the Wheatley Commission.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcolm MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that you, Sir Beresford, have enjoyed this Committee debate as much as I have. Indeed, I must say that I have never heard so many Committee speeches made on a what was to have been a Second Reading debate.<br><br>
Litle reference has been made to the most important aspect of planningâ€”regional planning and its application in regional development. We have had discussion of the details of local planning procedures almost <i>ad nauseam</i>, but little if anything at all, about regional development. Yet we have in Scotland the one Development Board in Great Britain, for which we in the north of Scotland should be extremely grateful. I now pay this single tribute to it. Perhaps my hon. Friend the Minister of State will make at least some reference to the future of regional development, which is vital. Changes which may be made in local
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 88</span>
procedures are important, but regional development is the big question of national significance.<br><br>
Here again, we have the great difficulty of highly trained adequate staffing. There is a grave national shortage of people with the very special qualifications which are essential for regional development. This lack of planners with experience of development on the regional level and scale is the key problem. Subject to full scrutiny in Committee, most of us accept that the Bill will do a limited but useful job of work in many respects. My hon. Friend referred to the first, tentative advances made towards regional planning and developmentâ€”almost for the first time in this countryâ€”in any serious way which have begun only in the last few years. I endorse and welcome his comments.<br><br>
We have to look forward seriously to the time when we shall have a Minister and Ministry of Co-ordination in this sphere. This is, of course, not novel. It has been done in those countries with the best and longest experience of regional development. And regional development in the under-developed countries is being helped by us via O.E.C.D. and otherwise. In the Scottish context, we should have a Minister of Minister of State status in charge of co-ordination of planning. Along with education, this is perhaps the most important field of all with which we in Parliament shall be concerned in the coming years. To supervise, co-ordinate, assist and encourage national planning and regional development and supply of all the necessary equipment and resources, we must have a Minister of very senior status in the Government. There should be high powered authorities ultimately responsible for development policy and programming on the regional scale.<br><br>
I intended to comment on certain aspects of the Bill in some detail, but was exceeded in any detail I contemplated by some hon. Members who have spoken in the minutest local detail on those parts of the Bill to which they addressed themselves. I therefore relieve the Committee of any fear they may have of my dealing with such Committee points in detail myself.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Minister of State mentioned the importance of involving
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0117">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 89</span>
the public in the planning debate at each stage. That is a valuable declaration of intent and determination by the Government. He has introduced certain provisions to this end which were not previously present in planning law. He emphasised the vital need for advance land use planning. This again is vital. He mentioned development planning and was the only person to give emphasis to it in the debate. He also emphasised the importance of distinguishing strategy from tactics, and I hope that the Committee, too, will not fail to do this in future. It has manifestly failed to do so thus far. Rightly he tried to insist on distinguishing strategy from tactics. That is vital and needs more emphasis.<br><br>
12.30 p.m.<br><br>
I hope also, in the context of some of the points made about planning being overtaken by local and other changes and events, that hon. Members will recognise that planning is a mobile, flexible and dynamic thing, a modern, advanced dynamic science, and not just a localised concentration tinkering about with what should be the size of a garden shed, rights of light, and so on, however important these other questions undoubtedly may be. Important they are, of course, for local amenity and, indeed, within district-scale, town and country planning; but there are beyond them the larger national and regional development issues, which far transcend questions of procedural method and local physical planning.<br><br>
The vital systematic analysis referred to by my hon. Friend the Minister of State in passing, though with some emphasis nevertheless, must take into account not only local changing conditions, but significant developments in more than one part of the countryâ€”physical change, industrial change, economic and social changeâ€”and it must anticipate as far as possible further and longer-term change factors as well.<br><br>
We have not looked widely enough or far enough ahead in our deliberations on the Bill. ePrhaps the Bill itself does not measure up to the scope of these considerations; but it goes at least part of the way in that direction. Often, the disturbing factors in local analysis and plans arise from factors in adjacent areas outside the control of the local planning
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 90</span>
authority. Sometimes they come even from quite distant areas where, for instance, changes in part of a national industry could have a quite serious effect on local conditions elsewhere, necessitating new analysis and change of plans.<br><br>
I shall try to take no more than another minute or so. We are under extreme pressure of timeâ€”most unreasonable and almost indecent pressure, if I may say so, in the amount of time we have for considering a matter of such paramount importance as this to the future of our country.<br><br>
In my view, we should not wait for the Wheatley Report on Local Government Reorganisation. It is nonsense to expect, whatever the Wheatley Commission will say, that the local government or regional boundaries will necessarily and automatically coincide with what are the ideal economic development regions and fit in within their frontiers and demarcations. It is nonsense to expect that we could have from Wheatley or any other source a set of local government boundaries as such, within which planning regions would also find their ideal or optimum scale and scope. The Minister, therefore, at least in that respect, is right in his argument about the Bill's timing.<br><br>
It may be that we should look forward to the time when regional planning overshoots all local boundaries, not only of the proposed internal regions, but of countries, too, even including Scotland, England and Wales. It has been seriously mooted, as hon. Members know, that Carlisle should be the planning centre of an area embracing part of the south of Scotland and part of the north of England. Equally, there might be overlapping of the national boundaries of England and Wales in an effort to create viable economic development units and areas across frontiers. Unfortunately, in the public mind so much of the idea of planning has been concerned in the past with purely procedural matters, with refusals of grants, domestic and local planning permission, and with wholly local questions, that many of the wider considerations have never been properly debated or understood.<br><br>
I greatly regret that our own country, as the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) said, has not done more to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0118">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 91</span>
train, recruit and, ultimately, to employ people with knowledge of major development and planning. There is something which, perhaps, we could urge those responsible to do in that respect. We do not want to talk in terms of trying to influence universities academically; or, indeed, even the Town and Country Planning Institute. But I understand that to this day the diploma and qualifications of graduates who take the advanced two-year course at Glasgow University in regional planning are not recognised for the purposes of the Institute and find great difficulty, compared with the man qualified in traditional planning disciplines, in securing acceptance and suitable employment. The Institute can surely make a start in clearing up this anomaly and anachronism. The hon. and learned Member for Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) may take this protest lightly, but I regard it as a vital question. If we do not have the men for the strategic tasks and the main job, then that main job will not be done. We shall fall even further behind, even behind the backward and only now developing countries in which we ourselves contribute to the supply of economic development experts and resources and with training for the carrying out of their own regional development schemes.<br><br>
As I say, today's narrow debate and timetable create very frustrating circumstances in which to try to consider these important matters. Perhaps the only answer to having a Committee stage on what officially should have been a Second Reading is to make one's Second Reading speech in Committee. I am giving the Chair that gentle warning, far better warning than was given by some hon. Members opposite and others who narrowed and localised the debate.<br><br>
I conclude on a Highland note. In the exercise of its duties, which, in my view, it is doing very well with all the inadequacy of equipment and trained personnel at its hand, the Highland Development Board is in danger at this moment of having the Western Isles more or less sucked across the Minch and the North and West of Scotland toppling into the Moray Firth in an economic development and planning sense. Unless there is much greater emphasis on regional development in the West of Scotland and, soon
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 92</span>
again, in the North, there will be major development distortions of this kind which will create further depopulation and draw people from the periphery to the Invergordons and the major growth points. That is a criticism which I intended to modify somewhat in elaborating it with certain other comments which, in view of the time, I shall not now make. I return to the point that we must look a good deal further ahead beyond the considerations of today's discussion and into a serious examination of regional development based upon an adequate supply of highly trained people.<br><br>
These people must be the best we can find, recruiting not only here but out in the world. We must do what other countries are doing; we must go out into the world and find the best people for the job, a job which so many of our present regional planning people and even the Development Board, excellent though they are within their limited present terms of reference, cannot expect adequately to do, are not, as presently staffed, capable of doing and have no experience so far in attempting. We must, at Government level, look also, as I have said, to the time when a Minister of senior status is available for the purpose of coordination.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. G. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is generally agreed that a Bill is needed to make changes and improvements in our planning legislation. There is, however, a doubt about the timing of the Bill, both the time for its consideration and the time when it will come into effect. This has already been made clear, but I shall return to the point in a moment.<br><br>
We support a good deal of the Bill in principle. It is a long and important Measure. Today, however, I shall concentrate on the main points about which there are doubts and criticisms. I am reminded that exactly a year ago the Minister of State and I started on the marathon Committee Stage of the Transport Bill. That, also, was a very long Bill on which there was agreement as to a large part although we strongly objected to certain provisions.<br><br>
Last Tuesday, my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) did the Committee a great service by his penetrating analysis of the likely effects of the main provisions of the Bill
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0119">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 93</span>
on present planning, and he underlined the weak points and the undesirable elements in it. One important doubt surrounds our whole consideration of these proposals. I refer to the future structure of local government, a matter which hon. Members on both sides have constantly emphasised. The procedures proposed in the Bill might be suitable to the present form of local government, but they may not be suitable to the future system which emerges from a consideration of the report of the Royal Commission still not yet before us. It may be some time before legislation is introduced and passed. Therefore, although we may agree, in the main, with the principles set out in the Bill, we consider that various aspects of the machinery will require reconsideration. One of the improvements which we welcome is the inclusion of transport and traffic considerations within the planning context, an important advance, as the Report of Professor Buchan emphasised some years ago.<br><br>
I come now to Part I, the proposed structure and local plans. The immediate point to be noted is that the local plan is dealt with entirely by the local authority which formulates it. Unless the Secretary of State decides to call in a local plan, the local authority concerned takes the final decision upon it. We shall want to be satisfied that there is a system ensuring that copies of plans at the appropriate stage will go automatically to the Secretary of State. Otherwise, how will he be fully informed in time to call in a plan if he thinks that it raises controversial issues.<br><br>
Next, the question of publicity. We welcome the intention that there should be more publicity given to proposals in a plan, but we shall wish to ensure that it is adequate. There may be argument both in Committee and later, if the Bill goes through in its present form, about what is adequate publicity and whether adequate publicity is given. But, usually, the local authority will itself decide upon the plan where there are objections, and it will thus be both party and judge in a case before it. This must be wrong. Hon. Members on both sides have pointed out that the Bill in its present form is wrong in this respect and that it could destroy confidence in the whole process of formulating local plans.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 94</span>
The expected changes in local government structure will affect the situation in that respect. It is possible that the decision which, under the Bill, is to lie with the local authority formulating a plan could be taken in some future structure by the top-tier authority if a two-tier system emerges. That would make much more sense. But the difficulty is that it is not justifiable as it stands in the Bill at present, being geared directly to the planning authorities existing in Scotland now. We want to know from the Government, thereforeâ€”perhaps the Minister may reply on this today or leave it to the Committee stageâ€”what they have in mind for the meantime, during the period while the present system continues and till the new system of local government comes into effect.<br><br>
Ought matters not to be left as they are, with appeals going to the Secretary of State or controversial questions being settled by the Secretary of State, till a new system is devised after the Wheatley Commission has reported?<br><br>
Now, the question of structure plans. The hon. Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Mackintosh) argued, if I understood him aright, that in the interim period these plans would affect many authorities, and he asked whether there ought not to be some temporary amalgamations of local authorities. I put this point to the Minister, too. During the period before there is some larger regional authority, if that is to emerge, how are the structure plans to be dealt with? Presumably, in many cases they will cover much wider areas than the area of the present planning authorities. Have the Government any ideas and intentions regarding what should happen during, say, the next five to eight years? That is probably the period before a new system of local government can come into existence.<br><br>
12.45 p.m.<br><br>
I come to the question of appeals and Part III of the Bill. Here lie our main doubts about the Bill. The Government have not yet shown, inside or outside Parliament, that this Part is needed in Scotland. Hon. Members on both sides have pointed out that the situation in England and Wales is very different from that in Scotland. There are in England and Wales many thousands of appeals a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0120">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 95</span>
year and considerable delays in dealing with them. There is a full-time corps of inspectors who are used to assist the Minister. In Scotland there are, not inspectors, but reporters who are appointed on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis. The system works, and, on the whole, time is not wasted.<br><br>
On 18th December, the Secretary of State gave me a Written Answer which has been most helpful in setting out the facts about the situation in Scotland. I asked to be told the situation over the previous three yearsâ€”from 1965 to 1967. From his replies, it is clear that there are between 300 and 400 appeals a year. Between 100 and 200 inquiries arose during those three years. The significant point was that the number of inquiries was diminishing over the three years. It is therefore surprising that, as has been stated by Lord Hughes in the other place, the Government should be contemplating the possibilities of a great increase in the number of appeals.<br><br>
I will read the significant part of the Secretary of State's Answer concerning the time taken on the appeals and the right hon. Gentleman's decisions:
<br><blockquote><p>"In the two years 1966 and 1967 the average time from lodging the appeal to the announcement of my decision was 45 weeks in the cases dealt with by inquiry. This average, however, was weighted by a number of cases in which action was suspended for long periods at the appellant's request while he negotiated with the local planning authority. In these two years my decision differed from the Reporter's recommendation in about 5 per cent. of the cases decided."â€”[OFFICIAL REPORT, 18th December, 1968; Vol. 775, c. 401.]</p></blockquote>
I am grateful to the Government for doing the necessary research in the few days that I had to table the Question after the Bill was published and for making that information available.<br><br>
Everyone in the Committee agrees that this change, which was no doubt necessary in England and Wales, is entirely unnecessary at present in Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At present.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I said "at present". The Minister and Lord Hughes have stated that there is no justification in Scotland for setting up a full-time corps of inspectors. Lord Hughes indicated that, if the Bill were passed in its present form, the Government would indefinitely
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 96</span>
postpone bringing the Clauses in Part III into effect. Presumably this would be done under Clause 102, which is the commencement Clause. It is stated there that the Secretary of State can appoint different days for different parts of the Bill, but I hope that the Minister will tell us today the Government's intentions, because this is a very important point. Will he confirm that there is no intention of bringing this Part of the Bill into effect? Will he show how that is to be done under Clause 102, which indicates that the whole Bill will come into effect on a certain date? There is a limit to the amount of legislation on which Parliament should be asked to spend time which has very little prospect of being put into effect. I am sure that the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) will agree with that. That is why we shall seriously question in Committee whether Part III need be in the Bill.<br><br>
I turn to the question of planning blight on which my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) touched. This is the loss of value of property or the inability to sell or mortgage it which can arise from planning proposals. This is a very difficult problem. The 1959 legislation improved the position considerably, but the structure plans are likely to be vaguer than the present form of development plan. This will make the question of planning blight much more difficult. It will be less easy to decide whether the value of the property or the inability to sell has been affected by a planning proposal. We shall seek to ensure that individuals are given the maximum protection possible while not delaying the formulation of desirable plans.<br><br>
Fortunately, there is a great deal of experience in these matters in the Committee. That is clear from the debate, and I hope that that situation will continue during the Committee stage. My hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) was a convener of a planning committee. The hon. Members for Dundee, West (Mr. Doig) and Midlothian (Mr. Eadie) have similar experience. The observations of the hon. Member for Midlothian, however, seemed to lack the usual spontaneity which we usually associate with him.<br><br>
Part V of the Bill deals with buildings of architectural and historic interest. My
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0121">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 97</span>
hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith) and my noble Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North (Earl of Dalkeith) referred to this matter. I support them in principle, but we shall be asking whether the protection of these buildings is being carried out in the best way, whether further buildings should be included, and whether all the bodies concerned have been adequately consulted. For example, the Church of Scotland is particularly involved in this question.<br><br>
This is an important Bill. I agree that structure and local plans should be broadly similar in the way in which they are devised all over the United Kingdom. It is of great assistance to all concerned if planning principles are similar all over the United Kingdom. But there are places in which the Scottish machinery could, with great advantage, be different. We have outlined places where this could profitably be achieved in the Bill.<br><br>
There is an uncertainty about the local government structure which will hang over us in Committee, despite the second sight which my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr seems to have.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Exclusively.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is a very good prophet, and therefore I listen carefully to everything he says. There is no doubt that, even after the publication of the Royal Commission's report, there will be debates and great controversy. People will be very much concerned about whom they wish to amalgamate withâ€”or do not wish to amalgamate with.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is more important.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We hope that the Government will be very chary about appearing to prejudice the issue. We shall find it difficult to consider this legislation concerning local and structure planning while this great question mark hangs over the future form of local government.<br><br>
On the whole, this has been a nonpartisan debate. The Minister was disbelieving on Tuesday when my hon. Friend the Member for Hillhead said that he would make some suggestions in a non-party spirit, which he did. He dumbfounded the Minister when he paid
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 98</span>
a glowing compliment to him. The Minister said that he was open to suggestions for improving the Bill. I assure him that we will not disappoint him. I hope that he will seriously consider what we put forward, and what undoubtedly hon. Members opposite will put forward, in Committee, and will not think that the Government's prestige necessarily depends on certain parts of the Bill. If the Government regard our suggestions with an open mind we can substantially improve the Bill. Although the timing is unfortunate, the Bill will, in the long run, be needed in Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With permission, I should like to reply to the debate.<br><br>
I am very grateful for the closing remarks of the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Gordon Campbell). He will recall that at the end of every Committee stage of a Billâ€”and there have been quite a number of themâ€”I give the number of Amendments which the Government, in their good sense, have accepted and the number which we have debated. I admit that the Opposition have improved considerably in the number of helpful and constructive Amendments which they have proposed and which the Government could accept. I hope that they will improve on their record in improving this Bill.<br><br>
I am grateful to the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) for the personal service he did me this morning, which I hope he will not tell anybody about. I am much more indebted to my hon. Friend the Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan), because he distinguished between strategy and tactics. I should like to deal with the strategy in the time at my disposal rather than with many of the valid and important points concerning individual Clauses raised by hon. Members. I do not think that their time has been wasted, because I now have notice of the points and I hope to be able to discuss them at the appropriate time.<br><br>
My hon. Friends the Members for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Dewar) and Dundee, West (Mr. Doig) referred to the question of consolidation. Disraeli said in his younger days, when he had sideburns and was much more progressive, that the Conservatives were in favour of reformâ€”the last reform, not the next reform. Consolidation is easy if one is in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0122">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 99</span>
favour only of the last reform, because one merely consolidates all that one has done before. But we are in favour of this reform. Therefore, till we pass this reform, it would be very foolish to consolidate the law. We will consolidate the lawâ€”and I agree that it is necessaryâ€”once we have passed this major reform on town and country planning. I hope that my hon. Friends will accept that. I gave a similar pledge to the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn when he asked me a similar question during our discussions on the Housing Act, 1967. He knows that I honoured the obligation which I undertook that would consolidate all Housing Acts, including the 1967 Act, in one large Measure. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for helping us to get it through Parliament.<br><br>
I turn to the big issues of the debate. I deal first with the timing of the Bill. My hon. Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Mackintosh) said on Tuesday:
<br><blockquote><p>"Let us trace what is likely to happen if the Bill is passed. The 57 planning authorities will be asked to produce structure plans."â€”[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>Scottish Grand Committee,</i> 21st January, 1969; c. 40.]</p></blockquote>
If my hon. Friend will re-read my speech, he will see that that is not our intention. We recognise, from the nature of the authoritiesâ€”I will not identify themâ€”and the nature of their circumstances, that we should not expect them to prepare structure plans. Some of them are far too small. Others, like the cities and some of the very large counties, could, with profit, prepare structure plans.<br><br>
What I have tried to found my argument on is the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. W. Baxter). For twenty years, we have had provision not merely for voluntary amalgamation and co-operation on an advisory scale, such as is the case in Part III of the First Schedule of the original Act. My hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire has a distinguished record as leader of his county. Even though he does not always say flattering things about Ministers, I am happy to pay him that compliment because it is not flattery; it is true. His recollections of the Clyde Valley planning authority days are very important.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 100</span>
What is provided for in Part III is joint advisory committees in relation to the voluntary combination of authorities which will be unaffected by the Act.<br><br></span></p>
<p><i>And it being One o'clock,</i> The CHAIRMAN, <i>pursuant to Standing Order No. 66</i> (<i>Meetings, of Standing Committees</i>), <i>deferred adjourning the Committee.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the worst comes to the worst, Part II of Schedule 1 of the 1947 Act has regulations, paragraphs and sections dealing with the combination of authorities by order. I hope that we shall never come to that, but, if there were desires by authorities to come together closer than in advisory committees and closer still by partial amalgamation for specific purposes, certainly we would see the Bill as being useful.<br><br>
Inverting the argument, if we do not pass the Bill, it will not be possible to produce a structure plan. In my direct reference to Lanarkshire, I referred to the two years of study that we had with six large burghs and one county planning authority. One of the consequences of that was a draft structure plan which, in law, is non-existent until this Bill is passed. It is a draft structure plan of Lanarkshire. It is not perfect, and it is not completely precise, but it was discussed amicably over 18 months. It is the kind of plan that an authority for this area would make if we had only one planning authority rather than seven.<br><br>
Although there are differences of view about what the Government said about the development of Stonehouse and East Kilbride on 17th of this month, there is a strong body of opinion among Lanarkshire councillors that something of this kind is urgently needed in Lanarkshire.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Fife, East (Sir J. Gilmour) referred to the Metra plan. One of the interesting comments on it has come from Councillor James McClure, the Chairman of the Clyde Valley Planning Advisory Committee. In <i>The Glasgow Herald</i> of yesterday he is quoted as saying:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is perhaps unfortunate that the Report did not encompass the whole region of the Clyde Valley. It would appear that the time is now ripe for a continuation of the study to take in the whole of West Central Scotland."</p></blockquote>
I welcome that. I realise that the Clyde Valley Committee is advisory, but there
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0123">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 101</span>
is no reason why, within the grouping of authorities covering the Clyde Valley area, they should not come together between the passage of this Bill and the Act providing for the re-organisation of local government following the Wheatley Commission's Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John P. Mackintosh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If my hon. Friend is not expecting all the 57 authorities to produce structure plans, will the Scottish Office indicate the authorities which are not expected to produce such plans and which they would like to see co-operating, such as the East, West, and Central Borders?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the context of regional and economic development, the answer is, Yes. We have a good example in the Borders. We have begun one in Falkirk and Grangemouth. We have Lanarkshire. Clearly there is one which must be thought about in relation to the area covering Bishopbriggs, Cumbernauld, Kirkintilloch, Lennoxtown, and so on. In other words, there are areas where it is crying out to be done and where the machinery of an Act of Parliament is very important for it to be done with effect.<br><br>
To take the estimate of five years needed to translate the Wheatley Report into effectâ€”and it might take as much as 10 years or as little as fourâ€”it is a very long time to leave everything frozen in its 1947 mould. Part I is therefore important, though not in the sense that it will be applied to all the 57 planning authorities. We cannot produce a Bill for part of Scotland. We have to encompass the whole of Scotland.<br><br>
When we propose a Measure to reform local government, it will be a big one and a contentious one. It may not divide the parties, but it will divide the parties internally. That Bill, therefore, must not be too long. It has its own problems. It should, therefore, be able to refer to the Social Work (Scotland) Act, which can be adapted to the reform of local government, the Water (Scotland) Act. which expressly provides for adaptation to local government reform, the police reforms conducted by my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) and the other suggestions in the Sewerage (Scotland) Act, which we discussed last year. These are all part of the modernising Statutes of local
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 102</span>
government. This part of the Bill is very much welcomed by the local authorities, who want to be able to do a lot of work between now and reform by voluntary combinationâ€”â€”</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. N. R. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Committee is naturally interested in what the Minister is saying, but could he clear up one point? The Bill says that there is a duty on the local planning authorities, that is, those authorities in the 1947 Act, to institute a survey of their district and then, under Clause 2, a further duty to report on that survey and approve a structure plan. I appreciate what the hon. Gentleman is saying about how he expects this to work, but that is not what the legislation at the moment says.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One must make a distinction between what is written into a Bill and what happens. The 1947 Act itself has not yet been completely honoured. There is certainly at least one authority, and possibly two authorities, which have not given us their first development plan under that Act. What the Government have been doing over these years is to keep chasing up those authorities. We insist that everybody is under an obligation to produce a structure plan, but we cannot expect everybody to do it exactly all at once. I said that it will take us some time and that, even by the time that it was put into operation, we did not expect to have completed the structure plan survey of Scotland.<br><br>
I have mentioned how the statutory reform of local government would adapt itself. The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. James Davidson) asked about the nature of structure plans, and asked whether they would be comprehensive. The answer is, Yes. He asked whether there would be five plans. No. There are to be 35 different uses of land. In addition, a code of lettering is to be used to distinguish 21 further uses of land, and symbols are available for a further 16, so it is even much more exhaustive than our Liberal colleague was asking for.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) tried to criticise the vagueness of structure plans and especially action areas. I realise that he was somewhat misled by the not very well informed attempt in the Edinburgh Quinquennial Review to identify
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0124">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 103</span>
action areas. That did nothing more than define the boundaries of the areas concerned and indicate that, within those boundaries, comprehensive treatment would be necessary. But that is not our meaning of action areas. We mean by that term, as it implies, areas of very precise action over a precise period of time, beginning now and probably up to five or 10 years ahead. Not all that the hon. and learned Gentleman said was unfair, but the action areas included in that Quinquennial Review were deliberately excised by the Secretary of State, not because they did not exist in the Statute, but because they were not the kind of action areas which we intended.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith) said that action areas are not so good as comprehensive development areas, but if he looks closely at thisâ€”he used to know his stuff on [ILL]is very wellâ€”he will see that action areas are much more specific than those comprehensive development areas, which are pretty good. The idea is that they will be action areas trying to get the specifics of development, which are the points of reference which I made at the beginning, made even more tight. We in Glasgow are already in trouble over the application of CD.A.'s. It is a most difficult problem and one that is not due to inefficiency. The planners in Glasgow are very good, as are the whole staff of the Town Clerk's office. But it is a difficult system to carry into practice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. T. G. D. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has there been any comment from Glasgow?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not directly but through the Associations. The local authority Associations have been working on this for over a year. We had some observations from the Association of County Councils and it is now satisfied, it says, with our discussions and the Bill as it stands. Naturally, it is entitled to make other suggestions on reflection. We have had no direct communications from the two other local authority associations.<br><br>
I take the criticisms of Part II made by my hon. Friend the Member for Midlothian (Mr. Eadie) and I will see whether we can introduce a suitable Amendment. I was impressed by the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 104</span>
points he made. I will deal with the matters he raised at length in Committee.<br><br>
I agree that there is a lot of ill-feeling about appeals. The reason we do not have so many appeals in Scotland is that there is less pressure on land there. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, North (Earl of Dalkeith) gave an additional reasonâ€”that the population is static. We do not like it to be static in quantity and perhaps we can change that. However, we can leave that argument aside for the moment. But while the overall quantity may be static, there is an immense flow going out of the City of Glasgow to Lanarkshire. No fewer than 40,000 people will be moving out of Glasgow to Lanarkshire in the next few years and, of course, Renfrewshire and Dunbartonshire will also receive people from Glasgow. I should be surprised, therefore, if a number of planning appeals did not arise in that process. Perhaps we should accept, therefore, that we may need this new procedure.<br><br>
However, I am prepared to consult my right hon. Friend to suggest that we might agree not to bring in this particular provision before consulting Parliament, perhaps by negative or affirmative Resolution. I make it clear that I have not yet discussed the matter with him, but, if it is the wish of the Committee, I will do so. After all, if we omitted Part III now, the next Labour Governmentâ€”or, if there were some calamity. the next Conservative Governmentâ€”would have to find time to bring in their provisions in a separate Bill. It would, therefore, be short-sighted of us to leave out these provisions now and we would be justly criticised for it in years to come if we did.<br><br>
Edinburgh New Town is a symbol of historic buildings. The provisions dealing with these constitute one of the most important Parts of the Bill. I agree that we can improve the situation immensely if we ask people to look at this problem constructively. There might be an argument for moving it from the Register of Sasines and this matter has been a great stumblingblock. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, North and I want to make progress. Alas, the English are further ahead of us on this sort of thing, but I hope that we shall look at the matter in strictly Scottish conditions.<br><br>
