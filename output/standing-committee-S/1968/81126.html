	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That if the proceedings on the Agriculture (Spring Traps) (Scotland) Bill are not completed at this day's Sitting the Committee do meet on Thursday at half-past Ten o'clock.—[	<i>Mr. Buchan.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Norman Buchan)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee have considered the Agriculture (Spring Traps) (Scotland) Bill in relation to the principle of the Bill.</p></blockquote>
My right hon. Friend told the House in reply to a Question on 6th December last that he proposed to introduce legislation to enable him to ban the use of the gin trap in Scotland. This is the purpose of the Bill. It has been a matter of serious concern to many people that the use of this cruel method of capture is still legal in Scotland—even though only against foxes and otters—a full ten years after it has been prohibited altogether in England and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As long ago as 1951, the Committee which had been appointed to inquire into Cruelty to Wild Animals—under the Chairmanship of Mr. Scott Henderson—reported that it had received more representations about the cruelty caused by the gin trap than on any other matter, and it concluded that the gin trap was a "diabolical instrument" which caused an incalculable amount of suffering, and that its sale and use in this country should be banned by law within a short period of time. That was 17 years ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When, however, certain of the recommendations in the Report were given effect to in the Pests Act, 1954, it was decided that it was desirable to make provision for allowing the continued use of the gin trap in Scotland, and the Agriculture (Scotland) Act, 1948, was amended so that, while generally prohibiting the use of spring traps which had not been approved by the Secretary of State, it
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
also gave a specific power to the Secretary of State to authorise the use of unapproved spring traps, either generally or on conditions related to the animals which might be caught by them or the circumstances or areas in which they might be set. It was under this power that the Secretary of State, in 1954, made the Order known as the Agriculture (Spring Traps) (Scotland) Order, 1954, approving generally the use of unapproved traps against wild animals throughout Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Within the next four years humane alternative traps were developed and approved for use against rabbits, hare and vermin, but not against foxes and otters, and the 1954 Order was replaced by the Agriculture (Spring Traps) (Scotland) Order, 1958, which allowed the use of unapproved traps against foxes and otters only. It is this Order which allows the use of the gin trap today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that in 1954 it was hoped that it would be possible to get rid of unapproved traps in Scotland within the near future, and this hope was fulfilled within four years' time for all the animals concerned other than foxes and otters. The Act had provided that if a humane alternative were found, the Secretary of State might withdraw any authority given to use unapproved traps, and he was acting under this power in 1958, when their use was limited to foxes and otters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since 1958, the Humane Traps Panel, which was set up in 1954 to advise the Agricultural Ministers on the approval of new traps, has been concentrating its attention on trying to find a suitable alternative to the gin trap for use in Scotland, and in 1964 the Panel was reconstituted on a primarily Scottish basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In spite of its assiduous application to the task of trying to find a humane alternative to the gin trap, it has so far been unsuccessful, and, although it is still hoped that it may be possible to find an alternative within the four-year period specified in the Bill, we have felt it becoming more and more indefensible to continue the use of the gin trap year after year in the hope, so far disappointed, that a satisfactory alternative trap can be found.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not to say that we despair of such a trap ever being found, but it seems to the Government that it is not right
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0044">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
to continue this excessively cruel method of capture when there are other ways of taking and getting rid of foxes. While none of them may individually be a complete answer, it should, we feel, be possible to use these other means, perhaps in combination, to contain the problem. It may be that the final solution will be found through increased knowledge in directions quite different from those being examined by the Humane Traps Panel and not by the use of traps at all. I do not think that I should be drawn into making forecasts about these possibilities and what discoveries may be made or what techniques may be devised. My Department, together with the Ministry of Agriculture, is keeping in close touch with relevant research work. It is reasonable to hope that, with advancing knowledge methods may be found of controlling the fox which will, in the long run, be much more satisfactory than the gin trap or any other method known today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We realise that in some areas, although not everywhere in Scotland, those responsible for controlling foxes depend very heavily on the gin. It is because of this that we have decided, with some reluctance, and in the face of considerable pressure for immediate abolition, that the ban should not take effect till 1st April, 1973—that will presumably be for a period of about four years after the Act is passed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In devising our proposals, we have kept in close touch with the representatives of the interests most likely to be affected by this proposal—the organisations interested in the prevention of cruelty to animals, representatives of the farmers and landowners and of the freshwater fisheries interests—and have also taken the views of the Humane Traps Panel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While, not unexpectedly, those most concerned with cruelty to animals would prefer an immediate ban and those who suffer most from the activities of foxes would prefer to see action delayed as long as possible, it is fair to say that most have accepted the period of four years as reasonable notice to be given to enable farmers and others with responsibilities in this matter to consider what will be the best alternative form of control.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No doubt this matter will be explored during the morning. I may have something to say about it later. There are clearly those who want abolition immediately and those who wish, like the organisation to which my hon. Friend referred, to see it brought forward two years. There are certain provisions in the Bill which give rise to the possibility that this may be done. But in the absence of an alternative at present to cope with a situation without the gin trap, it seems to us that four years is a reasonable time. After all, while there are criticisms, it is being postponed for four years, and I hope that there is general pleasure that the decision is being taken that it will go.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We may explore that question later. There are experiments in the field of reproduction inhibition and so on which are closely connected with the problem, and we are keeping a careful watch on them. It may be that an alternative method can be found.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Humane Traps Panel has agreed that four years will give it a reasonable time to continue its efforts to find a humane and satisfactory alternative. Was it not Samuel Johnson who said that there was nothing like an approaching execution to concentrate a man's mind wonderfully? It may be that the time limit will help give a stimulus to the work being done on this matter. Four years was the period of notice given in England and Wales by the Pests Act, 1954, which provided for the use of unapproved spring traps becoming illegal in 1958.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should, however, direct the Committee's attention to the provisions in Clause 2 for varying the appointed day from 1st April, 1973. As so often happens in such Clauses, the provision looks rather formidable, but it is not really so. It seemed to us only right that when specifying a date as far ahead as April, 1973, we should, at the same time, take
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0045">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
power to vary this date if circumstances should alter. We are accordingly providing that the Secretary of State may advance or defer the date by an order which would be subject to negative resolution. Hon. Members would, therefore, have an opportunity to object to any proposal and to discuss it if they so wished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certain limitations are, however, laid down in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archie Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very strong ones.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The date cannot be advanced to earlier than two years from the passing of the Act, so there will be at any rate a minimum of two years given to those interests concerned with fox control. Therefore, even if this power is used those who rely on the gin at present will have a period of at least two years from the passing of the Act to try to find alternative measures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the proviso of the two-year period is valueless by 1971, because it would take two years before the order could be operated after that? Therefore, it would only be of value up to 1971; it would still be 1973 before the order would be operative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: An appointed day could be brought forward, but it could not be brought forward to nearer than two years from the passing of the Act. There would be at least those two years before it became operative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we were to defer the appointed day, this could only be done for one year at a time. We wish to give proper warning to those involved with a very serious problem. There must be one year's notice, at least, of the intention to change the appointed day; whether it is to be advanced or deferred there will be one year's notice. If it is to be advanced, the order must be made at least a year before the date to which it is to be advanced. If it is to be deferred, it follows that it must be laid two years before the new appointed day, because there must be a deferment for one year and notice of one year. Therefore, in the case of deferment there will always be two years from the decision to defer to the date when it becomes operative. This sounds complicated, but I hope that I have made it clearer. As the appointed
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
day cannot be more than one year after the date which is being deferred, there will be one year's notice that the appointed day is to be altered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will agree that, taken together, these provisions provide a reasonable flexibility while meeting the requirement of giving adequate notice to those affected and providing timeous opportunity for consideration of any proposed change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, I should make it clear that it is my view that this ban should become operative on 1st April, 1973. We have no intention of using the varying powers in Clause 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also remind the Committee that as the present provisions of the Agriculture (Scotland) Act, 1948, remain on the Statute Book till the appointed day, that Act could be brought into operation at once to ban the gin trap if a humane alternative trap had been found and was available in reasonable quantities. If those provisions were taken care of and a suitable alternative found, we could use the provisons of the 1948 Act to bring in the ban immediately. In such a case, all that would be necessary would be to make an order withdrawing the present authority to use unapproved spring traps on foxes and otters. The provision in the Bill removing entirely the basic authority to give such power would come into force on the appointed day. It could be considered whether in those circumstances there was a good reason for advancing the appointed day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have made the provisions of the Bill fairly clear. There is wide support for the general principle behind this step, but I recognise the criticisms that are made. Some will think first of the difficulties of those who have to cope with the problem by using the methods we propose to outlaw, if stripped of these methods. I recognise this, but the time has come to set a limit date for banning the gin trap, and if that date can reasonably be earlier than 1973, so much the better, but I think I should make clear that the Government's view is that, unless there is a drastic change in circumstances, there should be no question of postponing beyond that year the abolition of these excessively cruel and horrible machines known as gin traps.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am bound to say that I have several reservations about this Bill. Let me say straightaway, however, and quite emphatically, that I have no interest to declare. I have never used a gin trap on my own property. I do not understand, and the Minister has not made clear, why time is now being devoted to this Bill at all. I say that because my own impression is that legislation is quite unnecessary in order to achieve what is required. This Bill will not change the present situation in any significant degree at all although many of those who have written to me are under the firm impression that it is going to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I make two comments about the letters which I, and others, have received? It strikes me that the correspondents are under two impressions: first, that because the gin trap was abolished in England ten years ago, we in Scotland have been guilty of gross inhumanity in not abolishing it as well; and secondly, that Scotland is the only country which retains this admittedly cruel and crude instrument. But there is nothing inhuman or inhumane about the Scots. The English used these traps in rabbit burrows up to 1948 whereas we abolished the use of them more than fifty years ago. Secondly, I think that the Minister would be able to confirm—and I say this only for the purpose of putting the matter in its true perspective—that the gin trap is still used in many countries, countries which, I think, everybody here would describe as civilised, including several in Europe, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have said I do not think that this Bill is necessary. New legislation is not required to ban the gin. The Pests Act, 1954, banned the use of spring traps other than approved ones, but authorised the Secretary of State to allow the continued use of unapproved traps, and in 1958, as the hon. Gentleman told us, an Order sanctioned the continued use of the gin against foxes and otters. The Secretary of State already has power to withdraw that authority as soon as he is satisfied that the power to grant it is no longer necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of that, I should say that this Bill contributes absolutely nothing. The firm date of termination is not the date four years hence; it can be extended, it can be brought forward. It can be deter-
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
mined a year hence now, because no period of time is prescribed in the Pests Act; the Minister has only to be satisfied that a suitable alternative is available. It is absurd to say that by giving this limited extension a year at a time over and over the Government are now moving towards the elimination of the use of gin traps. The Secretary of State has already power under Section 10 of the 1954 Act to limit the use of traps to mountain areas. He can remove its use elsewhere at very short notice and he can limit is use already to geographical areas such as the crofting counties, or he can specify types of land such as areas predominantly of hill, mountain and heath. It has been the objective all along, and the reason for retention in Scotland has been the mountainous terrain, where it is extremely difficult to carry out control, which is so much easier in enclosed and woodland country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The gin in Scotland has been limited for many years now to foxes and otters. There is extremely little information available about the effect of its use on otters—that is, how many are caught, how many salmon are eaten by otters. All I could say is that in this field it is a good deal less significant than it is with foxes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the gin was abolished in England it was retained in Scotland because of our mountain areas and on 14th May, 1965, the Secretary of State, being asked about this, said that the answer lay precisely
	<br><blockquote><p>"in the facts of geography; we have far more hill and wild sheep land, and banning the gin would cause serious losses."</p></blockquote>
At the same time, he announced that a survey was to be made by the Humane Trap Panel over a year, and I will return to the question of the survey in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The gin, it is fully admitted, is a cruel instrument. Other animals undoubtedly are caught in it including kestrels, and eagles, and I well remember the highly cogent point made by Mr. Forbes Hendry at Question time about whether other animals than foxes were expected to read notice boards saying, "Beware of gin traps". It is also true that unscrupulous persons may use the gin trap unlawfully, but, on the other side of the scales, one has the fact that the fox population would rise and the losses in hill sheep would increase if there were not control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0047">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
This is, in fact, the answer to those correspondents who all in their letters say that England has the same type of land though on a smaller scale, such as Dartmoor and Snowdon, and yet England and Wales manage without the gin. The fact remains that Departmental advice on factual grounds in 1964 was that foxes were known to be on the increase in England and Wales since the gin was abolished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would now like to bring a certain amount of perspective into this. I have said and apologise for repeating it that suffering is caused to the animal caught in the gin, but I do not think that we should completely close our minds to the suffering caused to lambs and poultry when they are caught by foxes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Member not agree that the fox population in Scotland has also increased? There is undoubted proof of this in my own county and, I think, in Argyllshire. Was not the original use of the gin trap to control the rabbit population which myxomatosis has pretty well swept out altogether?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will deal with the increase in numbers of foxes in a moment but I would like to turn now to the damage done by foxes and the effect of the gin upon their numbers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had expected that the Minister would have given us some essential facts before we make up our minds on what I should have thought was a matter for individual judgment and nothing of a party line at all. When the right hon. Gentleman made the comment which I have already quoted, the survey to which he referred had not been made, and his observations were based on information supplied by the Department to the Secretary of State and, before him, to myself. That information was that grant-aided fox destruction clubs were killing about 8,000 foxes a year, and the Forestry Commission another 2,000. That information went on to say that about half that number were cubs most of which were gassed, and that probably more than half of the adult foxes were ginned. As a by line of interest, Doctor Lockey, of the Nature Conservancy, in a survey in Ross and Cromarty, had shown that in summertime lambs accounted for some 15 per cent. of foxes' diet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
The survey has now been made, and it is quite clear that the Departmental speculation at that time was too high. It has been found that 8,000 was certainly above the survey figure. The facts are that, in addition to the total of 10,000 killed by one means or another, 6,600 foxes were killed and that 2,000—and this was evidently a correct assessment—were killed by the Forestry Commission. The point is that 6,600 and not 8,000 were killed by the destruction clubs. Secondly, the survey showed that these 6,600 foxes alone had killed more than 4,000 head of livestock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Looking at the matter geographically and leaving out the Forestry Commission figure, because its plantations are spread over the whole country, one gets a situation, as shown by the survey, in which one-third of foxes killed—1,530 out of 4,600—were killed in the crofting counties and out of that, 1,530, 84 per cent.—1,284—were killed by the gin. In the south of Scotland, right through from Berwickshire to Ayrshire and Wigtown, a countryside which is much more enclosed than the Highlands, of 1,957 foxes killed, only 905 were taken by the gin, less than 50 per cent. and the balance nearly all by snaring. Over one third of Scotland's ewe flock is in the crofting counties and so there are a substantial number of foxes where most of the sheep stock is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know that it is strictly logical, but it approaches logicality to suppose that if the gin were banned with no effective substitute, in the crofting counties alone there would be 1,284 more foxes surviving in the first year than survive at the moment. If the law of averages were right, and 642 of those were vixens and each of those vixens had four per litter, if one allowed the usual rate of loss, one would have between 1,000 and 2,000 foxes in that area within 12 months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder if the hon. Gentleman the Under-Secretary could tell us, when he replies, about the advisory panel. It was originally established as a United Kingdom body in 1954, and according to information which I remember receiving, £5,000 was put into its funds for paying rewards to inventors of alternatives to the gin. By 1964, £3,000 had been paid to inventors of traps, mostly for catching
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0048">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
rabbits. In 1964 the panel was reconstituted and moved from London to Edinburgh. Are there eight members on it, and is the Department of Agriculture one? Are the £2,000 still available for anyone who can invent a satisfactory fox or otter trap? Must it be a trap, or will any alternative do, including an effective pill for foxes? That is what I understand that the Under-Secretary means by the reproductive inhibitant. I suppose it is inevitable that civil servants find it impossible to use a word which everybody understands. Would the inventor of such a pill qualify for that reward, and is the reward widely known? How is it made known? I have never seen an advertisement in any newspaper, agricultural or otherwise, announcing £2,000 reward for such an invention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Steel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was tempted to interrupt the Under-Secretary on the same point, but does the hon. Gentleman appreciate the difficulties here? What would be the effect of the pill for foxes on fox hunting, for example?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman certainly has a point. I would have thought he was being slightly mischievous. Not being a foxhunting man, I am obliged, at the risk of my life, to say that I believe that on balance the most important thing is to stop foxes eating lambs, whether or not we chase them on horses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How often does the advisory panel meet, and is the Under-Secretary under the impression that it is imbued with the necessary degree of energy and enthusiasm in furthering its task? I believe that in pre-war days a reward of £300 was offered and awarded by the R.S.P.C.A. and that it was paid to a gamekeeper named Mr. Sawyer, but all I know is that, soon afterwards, his invention revealed disadvantages. Can the Under-Secretary tell me what these disadvantages were? Was this what was known as the Imbra trap?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is in the survey an account of work done by what is known as the Highland trap, a gin set in such a way that when the fox goes in it falls into adjacent water and is drowned. This obviously shortens the suffering of the fox. Why has this trap been so successful in crofting counties where it has
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
accounted for just about half of the total taken by the gin and yet has been noticeably unsuccessful in all other areas of Scotland? Is this because there is more water handy for setting the trap in the crofting counties or is it because they have known the value of it up there?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not clear why the Under-Secretary seemed unwilling to take the Committee into his confidence on the progress being made with the pill. It is not all that a matter of indelicacy. All of us being adults on this Committee, we are perfectly willing to listen to a talk about birth control for foxes. What progress has been made by the Infestation Control Laboratory on a pill for foxes?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill intends that the use of traps should be banned at a future date. Is it intended to ban manufacture? If not, how does the Under-Secretary propose to enforce the Bill? Surely, with the wave of crime, in which he takes a laudable interest, it is not intended to have armies of police tramping the moors and hedgerows to look for gin traps.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot say that I am enthusiastic about the Bill and I dare say that the Committee will have sensed this. Procedurally, it is largely irrelevant, and in content it could be much better. In substantial areas of the country the gin must meantime remain till an effective alternative is found, but in other parts of the country I believe it could be removed a good deal sooner than the Bill envisages. The answers to the questions I have put and which other hon. Members will put to the Under-Secretary in this debate will influence our thoughts when we come to Committee stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. A. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This Bill recalls the strenuous time we had in 1948 putting through the Agriculture Act and trying to deal with this problem. Everybody then had the same view about the cruelty of this trap. I have had a letter from a farmer's daughter this morning pointing out that the trap does not only kill foxes but that it has killed her pets and that she has seen some terrible scenes of animals dying in these traps. I would have included a direct prohibition in 1948 but for the evidence brought to me by farmers and others about the cruelty which would then be occasioned among sheep and other livestock probably far in excess of the cruelty imposed on foxes. The gin
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0049">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
trap on a fox's mouth is not entirely a humane killer and many animals suffer cruely, but the poor little inoffensive lamb is just as entitled to sympathy as the predatory fox. We have to have a sense of proportion. The economic facts in 1948 were too strong to impose a prohibition. We took such steps as were necessary to deal with the problem in a way which would eliminate the need for this cruel trap.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is said that in 20 years inventors have not found a way to do this and it is optimistic to think that by us passing another Bill inventors will find a way of doing it. Perhaps the idea of the hon. Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles (Mr. David Steel) to import fox hunters into Scotland might be considered a more humane way of getting rid of foxes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have as many protests about this way of killing foxes as we have about the gin.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. D. Steel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to make it clear that that was certainly not my proposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the hon. Member, but it appears to be an alternative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would support the pill, and perhaps this would be a thing which the foxes would take voluntarily if they could be made to understand its effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How does one get the fox to the clinic?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is one of the inventions which Highland hon. Members might produce. The fox might take the pill in the mouth willingly if only it could be made to understand what would happen. We might experiment on these ideas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact is that even people horrified by these traps have not been able to find a method of saving lambs and other animals. I do not think the chick is any more enthusiastic about a fox's mouth than the fox about the gin trap. It is difficult to judge. We are all apt to get sympathetic about one evil and forget that the whole purpose is to prevent foxes from killing animals. Nature is red in tooth and claw and it can never be gentle and never kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
Death is not a nice thing even for us and many people die and suffer greatly from cancer and other diseases and not even medical science has discovered a way of making death easy, not even for human beings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We live by killing sheep and other animals and if the fox were allowed a free run it would interfere with food economics and with the production of lambs and cattle. It would be a disaster for agriculture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was able to accept the logic of the situation in 1948 and although we did what we could to abolish the gin then, it is up to those who want it stopped to try to find a method to replace it. Humane society is doing its best. If it could have been found, it would have been found. Unless this Bill give additional stimulation to inventors I do not understand how it will make any difference. Perhaps there should be more advertisements and announcements. From our experience in 1948 I would say that it is difficult to bring in an immediate prohibition and to say that foxes will be set free to ravage sheep and lambs, hens and other animals without intervention. It would simply mean bringing in more drastic methods. I hope that a way will be found, and I am interested to hear about the possibility of developing a biological method. That appears to be a humane alternative, and, in my view, more research should be concentrated on it in order to develop it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alasdair Mackenzie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The gin trap has been in use for a long time to destroy foxes, and the Bill seeks to prohibit its use after 1st April, 1973. It is fair to say that no one who knows anything about the gin trap will deny that it is a very cruel instrument which causes great suffering to animals caught in it. In general, farmers are lovers of animals, and they have no desire to see them suffer if it can be prevented. For that reason, any method which can be introduced to take the place of the gin trap is to be welcomed. That view has been freely expressed, and I confirm that it is the feeling of farmers in general.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was pleased to hear what the Under-Secretary of State said about the Humane Traps Panel. It is to be hoped that it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0050">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
will be given more facilities to get on with its work, with a view to producing an alternative to the gin trap before April, 1973.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can recall receiving only one letter from a constituent on the subject. It was from a lady who complained about the pain experienced by animals caught in gin traps. I agree about that, but I am surprised that those who object to the use of such traps on grounds of cruelty have so little sympathy with other animals. If they had ever seen a hill ewe trying to defend her offspring from a fox, probably they would change their minds. That should be borne in mind when considering this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Research is very important. I remember how we used to destroy rats. They took the proffered bait and passed away without pain. I am interested to hear about the possibility of using some form of pill——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not like this discussion to go very much further with hon. Members thinking that the pill will be on the market very soon. Research is going on, but, clearly, we want to know a great deal more about the fox and its habits before we get to the stage of using biological methods. The first stage on which our research is mainly concentrated is to understand the fox and its habits. Only then will we come to the second stage of developing this method of keeping them down. I hope that our debate will not develop into an argument about the use of the pill on foxes, because that is not on the cards at the moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacKenzie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I realise that the answer is not just round the corner and that a great deal more research is needed, but, in view of the destruction of young lambs in my part of the country, it is no use pretending that we can maintain the stock carried on the hills at the present time unless we find a way to deal effectively with the fox.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to remember that there has been a very big increase in the number of foxes in recent years. It is partly due to the increasing acreage of Forestry Commission and private plantations and the amount of extra cover that they afford to foxes. I have discussed
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
the problem with members of the Commission. They are anxious to co-operate, but they realise that the ever-increasing amount of cover makes it very difficult to deal with the problem as they would like.

Then again, we have nothing like the number of gamekeepers we had in the past. When they were employed by estates, they used to deal with foxes very effectively. In my younger days, we had only the odd one or two foxes, and there was a great rivalry between gamekeepers and shepherds to deal with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Highlands Area Agricultural Executive Committee, which covers only two of the crofting counties, operates a bonus scheme with a view to keeping down foxes. In the year ending 31st March, 1968, it paid rewards in respect of 580 adult foxes and 420 cubs. That gives some idea of the number of foxes in the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that we have a special problem in the north because of the peculiar features of the area, and special measures are needed to deal with it. The position is different in the south of Scotland. A number of years ago I attended a meeting of farmers in Edinburgh, and I drew attention to the increasing numbers of foxes in the Highlands. I suggested that special measures would have to be taken to deal with them. I was pulled up sharply by a Border sheep farmer, who put up quite a defence for the fox. I was surprised at his attitude, but I was told afterwards that Border farmers indulged freely in the cruel sport of fox hunting, and that, if the area were cleared of foxes, there would be no more Border hunts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not defending the gin trap. As the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) said, we admit that it causes suffering to animals. On the other hand, the Secretary of State is aware of the problems confronting hill farmers and of the many other hazards with which they have to contend at present. Measures which may be adequate to deal with the fox menace in the lowlands will not cope with it as it exists in the mountainous areas of the north of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I would recommend to the Under-Secretary of State that the fox be classified in the Highlands as a pest and should be dealt with in the same
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0051">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
way as the rabbit has been by establishing fox clearance societies. The rabbit clearance societies have been very successful. If similar bodies were set up to deal with foxes and given the same financial help, I am sure that numbers would be greatly reduced in a very short time. Such a method would also serve to minimise the suffering, because there would not be so many foxes to deal with. The proprietors of areas with big infestations of foxes could be made to deal with the problem through these clubs. They could be made to pay contributions to them, just as they do to rabbit clearance societies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will take note of these points. We want an answer to the problem. It must be stressed that the Highlands are a special area, and we hope that that fact will be recognised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is clear from what has been said so far that the Committee considers the gin trap to be a very cruel method for catching foxes. It is also clear that there are a great number of difficult problems associated with its abolition. It is precisely because those two facts have emerged from the debate that I find myself supporting the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart), who asks whether the Bill is really necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is it not true that the Secretary of State could simply withdraw the Order which permits the use of these traps? My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State does not reply, but, for the guidance of the Committee, I think that he should tell us. One has only to read Clause 1 to discover that it is quite possible to do it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This point has been raised already. Clearly, if it could be done in that way, we would do it. However, under the Act of 1948, we do not have that power. According to Section 50, the Secretary of State can only do it if he is satisfied about the quantities of approved traps available at reasonable prices. We do not have quantities of approved traps available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The obvious reply to that is that this Bill cannot be brought into operation till a satisfactory alternative has been found. I thought that that was
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
the whole burden of my hon. Friend's speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend did not pay full attention to my speech. That was not the burden of my speech. I said that it was felt that this legislation should come into operation in 1973, but that, if alternatives were found before then, we had to take account of the possibility of bringing forward the operative date. On the other hand, if research into alternatives does not move rapidly enough or there is a spread of the problem, there may have to be a deferment. When looking ahead four years, it is advisable to provide for some flexibility. That was the point of my speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is saying the same thing in different words. The earlier Act spelled it out more clearly. The view expressed this morning has been that we cannot do this till we get a satisfactory alternative. A satisfactory alternative is an effective trap which is within the reach of all persons concerned. This is splitting hairs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not really.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend laughs. The Act can be postponed year after year and come under the Expiring Laws Continuance procedure, so that every year we have to pass another Order to extend the Bill. This is what can happen under the Bill. The Bill is an expression of good intention which takes the form of saying that everything in the garden being lovely we will stop it in 1973 or, if possible, a little before. My right hon. Friend the Member for East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn) would have done this in 1948. He said at that time that if we could stop it we would. That has been said by every Secretary of State since without exception.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I must ask whether the Bill is necessary. For the two reasons already mentioned—first, that we all think the gin trap should be abolished, and, secondly, that we cannot abolish it till we find an answer to it—does the Bill really matter? I should think that when the Secretary of State feels that there is a satisfactory alternative available to farmers for destroying the foxes he can withdraw the Order permitting the use of the gin trap. If, as a result of that action, the number of foxes increased, he
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0052">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
could introduce another order. In other words, there could be an experimental period under existing legislation for one or two years. He could give the farmer notice that he intended to withdraw this Order in one or two years' time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This was the main argument for the Bill put forward by my hon. Friend. He said that the prospect of being hanged makes one think more furiously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: "Wonderfully" is the word.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend need not quibble about words. It does not destroy the argument that it was thought that this would make people think more furiously and result in a solution being found by 1973. Under existing legislation the Secretary of State could give notice that in two years' time he intended to withdraw the present Order. That would achieve the result which my hon. Friend wants; namely, of making people think more furiously. I was not sure who was to do the more furious thinking. At one time my hon. Friend talked about the Government and research establishments. He then said that it will make the farmers think more furiously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether my right hon. Friend wants an answer. The point was to make all people involved think not more furiously but more quickly and with more urgency. This would include the farmers, who would have to find themselves alternative methods, the scientists to devise other methods, and the Government who would be responsible for implementing the Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that. It would make people think. The Secretary of State could make an announcement tomorrow to the effect that he intended to withdraw the existing Order in a year, eighteen months or two years' time. That would achieve the effect that my hon. Friend claims for the Bill. There could be an experimental period and, if it were not successful, the Secretary of State could reintroduce the Order. We cannot do that under the Bill. All we can do is to keep postponing it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that the existing position is much more flexible and in accord with
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
the real needs of a very difficult problem. With a difficult problem which we do not know how to solve, but for which we are hoping for a solution, surely we need flexibility. However, the flexibility of the present situation is being removed. The only way that we can obtain the necessary time under the Order is by introducing annual orders. We can keep doing this for ever. The Bill does not promise that the use of the gin trap will be stopped before the year 2,000. Governments could go on introducing orders each year authorising its use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been puzzled by the Bill. I am not against it. However, I think it is a waste of time on our part. It makes the present flexible position less flexible, because it is mainly an expression of a hope that we shall be able to do something. It is asking us to do something which is not necessary. We all want something done about the gin trap, but we have had no explanation this morning justifying the introduction of the Bill. Therefore, I am puzzled, like the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West who, in the first part of his speech, raised this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the position regarding foxes in Scotland at present? My hon. Friend the Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel) asked whether they were increasing. I have heard that at present they are increasing, but I do not know what the information is. A lot of figures have been given. I have been informed that there has been a tendency for the fox population in Highland areas to increase.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Baxter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are becoming much more prevalent in the lowlands. We see quite a number of foxes, and we are greatly concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This raises a number of doubts. I should like to know what the situation is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to follow the point raised by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West about enforcement. The gin trap is much more important in Highland areas than in the rest of the country, and it will be very difficult to prohibit it in the Highlands. I understand that we are not supposed deliberately to spread myxomatosis, but I see it being done every time I go to the Highlands. I have seen rabbits which have died of myxomatosis
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0053">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
being put into rabbit runs to do this, but I understand that it is illegal. I do not see how we can control it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, West asked whether we should carry on allowing these traps to be manufactured and whether the control of their manufacture is not part of an endeavour to prohibit their use. I would have thought so. Therefore, we ought to hear something about that from my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have nothing further to say except, like everybody else, I think that the gin trap is a very cruel instrument and we should all like to see it abolished. Many other things are very cruel, although we do not hear so much about them, but I will not go into that now. We must weigh this matter properly. I shall await with interest my hon. Friend's explanation about why the Bill is better than the existing situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Clark Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In my humble opinion this Bill is both unnecessary and absurd. We are being asked to pass legislation which will only confuse those practising in the law or those who have to know something about it. There is no doubt that both my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) and the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) are right in saying that the Bill is not necessary. I ask right hon. and hon. Members to bear with me while I explain the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under Section 50 of the Agriculture (Scotland) Act, 1948, it is an offence, for the purpose of killing or taking animals, to use any spring trap, other than an approved trap. Approved traps are listed or specified by the Secretary of State. The penalty for an offence is £20. If there has been a previous conviction it is up to £50. Under Section 50(2) the Secretary of State may authorise the use of spring traps, other than approved traps. He may fix conditions—for example, geographical conditions, or limitation of the type of animals that may be so caught—although that is quite useless because animals cannot read. But—and this is the point that I wish right hon. and hon. Members to look at—under subsection (5)(	<i>b</i>) the Secretary of State has power,
	<br><blockquote><p>"when he is satisfied that the power to grant authorities under the said subsection is no longer necessary, by regulation withdraw all subsisting authorities granted under that subsection."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
That means that if the Secretary of State has already given authorities for non-authorised traps he has equal power to withdraw those authorities whenever he wishes, and he does not have to give notice. Why are we having the Bill? It is quite ludicrous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, that is not the main point. I hate the gin trap. For many years I have advocated its abolition. I have asked both Unionist and Labour Secretaries of State to take the necessary measures. I know that right hon. and hon. Members on both sides are with me in wishing to see its abolition. It causes great suffering, either by slow and painful death, or because of injury or starvation. If the animal can free itself, it is maimed for life. The trap is a diabolical instrument. It has been banned for the past ten years in England and Wales, it has been condemned by official committees, and it has been condemned by every society concerned with the welfare of animals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

The only reason given for its continuance in Scotland is that a larger proportion of land in Scotland is suitable only for hill farming, and is thinly populated. Therefore, there is greater chance for foxes to breed, and to prey on sheep. It is also argued that there is less opportunity for adopting counter-measures. All this is sheer bunk. There are plenty of areas in England and Wales where there is hill farming. How about the Devon moors, the Yorkshire moors and the Derbyshire moors, most of Cumberland and Westmorland and large areas of Northumberland? The argument will not wash.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In all these areas, which I entirely agree are very akin to, although smaller than, the Scottish Highlands, the fox population is increasing now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clark Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May be, but the farmers in England manage to deal with the menace of foxes, by shooting, gassing and bolting. What the English can do we can do as well or better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the possibility of the use of bait containing substances that control foxes, such as the birth pill control method. Considerable research is going on, but the point no hon. Member has made is that research is going on in other countries. What has the Under-Secretary of State to say about the research in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0054">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
Canada, which may be well ahead of ours?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ours is a great Christian and civilised country. Animals have a place in the scheme of things. As George Eliot wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Animals are such agreeable friends. They ask no questions, they pass no criticisms."</p></blockquote>
To abolish the gin trap is clearly right. It is our duty. The overwhelming majority of the population in Scotland, men and women, would back us if we now told the Secretary of State: "Abolish it tomorrow. Use your powers". That is our duty, and what I shall press for.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) I find myself somewhat puzzled by the Bill and why the Government have found it necessary to introduce it, but I welcome the opportunity it provides to focus attention on the increasingly serious problem for hill farmers in the Highland area of the growth of the fox population. I do not wish to go into detailed textual argument about the provisions of the Bill, but the case has been well made by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) that it was unnecessary to introduce it in its present form. Save in so far as it expresses an intention and desire that the gin trap should be abolished at a not too distant date, it is a somewhat otiose Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
None the less, the debate will have shown, that there is genuine concern throughout Scotland about the use of the gin trap. It is a cruel instrument which must be deplored by all civilised people. Whilst I would not wish to enter into comparative arguments about the suffering caused by the gin trap to the foxes and the suffering caused to sheep and lambs attacked by foxes, we must set our sights on the speediest abolition of the trap.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It appears that the appointed day is contingent upon certain conditions which are not spelled out in the Bill. The Under-Secretary of State shakes his head. It would be helpful if he would explain the position on that point before the debate is much older.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to go over this again. We have laid down a timetable—1973. That is four years away.
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
What we are saying is that it is very difficult to predict that the situation may not change by 1973 either way, and to a great and unexpected extent. We do not know. Four years is a very long time for contingency planning. If, for example, an alternative is found, a new situation develops, and it can be advanced. If an obvious alternative is found we do not need this legislation, and the gin trap can be abolished. This legislation envisages the possibility that no humane alternative will be found. If a humane alternative is found, we can use the 1948 Act. We say that even if a humane alternative is not found we intend to proceed with abolition. That is why it is wrong to say there is no need for the Bill. However, since no one can envisage what the situation may be in four years' time we wish to leave the Secretary of State a certain discretion. I am saying that our intention is to abolish the trap then. But if an alternative is found we will bring the abolition forward. If the situation catastrophically develops in another direction, we wish to leave discretion to look at the situation in four years' time. This is not related to the requirement that a humane alternative must be found. That is not the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that intervention, but it has not cleared up the doubt about the textual interpretation. My hon. Friend expressed the Government's intention, but that intention is not contained in the Bill. Clause 2 (1)(	<i>b</i>) makes it quite clear that it is possible for the Secretary of State to postpone the operation of this Bill beyond the appointed day, and the circumstances in which he would do so are not spelt out. We have nothing to go on, other than my hon. Friend's assurance that this is their good intention. I cannot see why, in these circumstances, which leave it open to the Secretary of State to decide whether or not the appointed day shall be the appointed day, we are bringing forward the Bill at this time. I think the position is clear from reading the Bill. Nothing my hon. Friend has said has changed my mind on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ross and Cromarty (Mr. Alasdair Mackenzie), made one or two very useful suggestions. My hon. Friend knows about them from previous correspondence we have had on
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0055">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
the subject. I have put to him earlier the need for establishing effective fox clearing societies in the Highlands. It has been suggested to me that it is impracticable to enforce participation in fox clearing schemes. The Government should appreciate that their present schemes for financially assisting fox clubs have serious loopholes. However effectively crofting townships may co-operate in clearing foxes from their areas—and there have been notable successes—the schemes are frequently jeopardised by the non-participation of some of the larger landowners who are chiefly concerned with the sporting potential of an area and not so much with its hill sheep raising potential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ross and Cromarty and other hon. Members opposite have pointed out that the sporting estates do not nowadays employ so many gamekeepers as formerly. These estates, which were once run efficiently as sporting units and controlled pests and foxes, now fail to do so. If the proprietors are not willing or able to control the foxes, the Government must help, because the fox club schemes are being bedevilled by the fact that large acreages surrounding the crofting townships are virtually immune from the efforts of the crofters. I have experience of this in my constituency in a number of crofting townships, where there has been very effective collaboration in clearing foxes from season to season, but they break through again from the virtually protected areas of the supporting hinterland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend has not grasped the seriousness of the problem and the depredations which result on the hill sheep population of the north-west Highlands. The gin trap is an appalling monstrosity which is utterly offensive, but no alternative device has been proved capable of dealing with the problem, but the effectiveness of some of the fox clearing clubs has been proved, provided the loopholes which I mentioned can be stopped up. I strongly urge the need for my hon. Friend to consider ways and means of enforcing the co-operation of the landward proprietors in the development of those clubs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. W. H. K. Baker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should begin by declaring a tripartite interest in agriculture, silviculture and fishing. Like
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
other Members of the Committee, I have found myself somewhat at a loss to under-stand the opening remarks of the Under-Secretary of State and some of his interventions on whether the Bill is necessary. He said in opening, that its purpose was to ban the gin trap, but later he said that the Secretary of State has power to do that immediately under Section 50 as of the 1948 Act, as amended. The hon. Gentleman shakes his head. I hope that when he replies he will make this clearer to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn) said that gin traps kill foxes. They possibly do so, as a by-product, but they do not kill cleanly, and that is the main reason why all of us in the Committee abhor their use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several hon. Members talked about the increase of foxes in Scotland. I do not think that there is any doubt that they are on the increase, notably in some areas in the northern parts of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, as I see it, it is lawful to use the gin trap for trapping four species or sub-species of animals in Scotland—foxes, otters, rats and other small ground vermin. In my submission, we could ban the use of gin traps immediately in the matter of taking otters without any trouble to the salmon in our rivers or any other kind of fish because, so far as I can read and so far as I have been told, there is little evidence at all that otters do any appreciable damage to fish in the rivers. If this Bill is passed it will ban the use of spring traps of all types but I would like to refer again to rats and small vermin, and to Section 10 amending Section 50 of the Agriculture (Scotland) Act, 1948, and the substituted subsection (7). When the Minister replies, would he say whether this Bill will mean that it will be unlawful to use any kind of spring trap for the taking of rats, mice, and other small vermin?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make it abundantly clear that I regard the gin trap with a great deal of abhorrence and fully endorse the words the Under-Secretary quoted when referring to the Report of 1951, that the gin trap is a "diabolical instrument".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The central committee of the R.S.P.C.A. in Scotland has written to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0056">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
me, and no doubt to other hon. Members, saying
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is the opinion of the Council that there is no reason at all to think that an alternative will be devised within the next four or five years".</p></blockquote>
and to that extent one can understand the Government's decision to make 1st April, 1973, a sort of D day. We might say that we have had, as individuals, possibly as much correspondence on this subject as on any other. There is nothing like cruetly to animals for arousing the ire of various interested parties, and it is against this background that we have to strike a balance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt at all that the removal of the gin trap without suitable alternative will raise serious problems, but I wonder how many here this morning have seen the effect of one night's work by a vixen in a chicken run? I have. I have seen the effect in a poultry run in which there were 120 pullets. A fox got in and killed about 80, but removed one, and one only. The rest of the flock were so terrorised that they never came to the point of laying at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So it is not only the effect on lambs that we are concerned with, but on poultry as well. It may be said with a certain amount of justification that poultry nowadays are intensively housed——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The rates are too high.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend wish to interrupt me?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not so intensive as my hon. Friend may think because of the present legislation which enforces very high rates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order, order. The hon. Member is bringing in politics.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be as my hon. Friend says. In the north of Scotland intensive methods are not so prevalent as in the lowlands. But the point I was making is that while cruelty to lambs has already been mentioned, the depredations of foxes can have a very grave effect on breeding flocks, and one paradox is that the effective working of rabbit clearance societies means that the foxes are losing their normal diet and are
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
having, of course, to turn to the more luscious alternatives of lambs and poultry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As some measure of the problem I would like to quote from a letter which I received last week. It is a circular letter from the North Eastern Agricultural Executive Committee and is headed "Fox Destruction Scheme". Part of two paragraphs of this letter state
	<br><blockquote><p>"Under the Scheme the Committee pay a bonus of 10s. for each fox or cub killed in the counties of Aberdeen, Banff, and Kincardine on production of a certificate showing that the brush has been handed in at the local police station. During the year ended 31st March, 1968, bonus payments totalling £530 were made in respect of 1,060 foxes and cubs killed."</p></blockquote>
This area of three counties may or may not be more than the area referred to by the hon. Member for Ross and Cromarty (Mr. Alasdair Mackenzie) where, he said, 800 foxes were killed in a similar period. These counties have mountain, hill and heath and, in proportion, probably more than the other two. So the banning of the gin trap will be felt just as badly in the areas I have mentioned as in the Highland counties already referred to by the hon. Member for Ross and Cromarty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been unable to find out, in the short time available, the proportion of that 1,060 was being taken in gin traps, but the poportion would seem to be about half. I do not know if the Under-Secretary has the information, but I understand that it may not be available because the brushes returned to the police station are not classified as coming from foxes killed by shotgun, snaring, gassing, trapping. Could we have some breakdown of the way in which these animals were killed, because it would bring the whole matter much more into perspective?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have thought that it would have been logical, if the Government are trying to act in as humane a manner as possible, that we should have gone the whole hog and prohibited snaring altogether. Why not stop netting in wire cages? Why not go the whole hog? The answer seems pretty obvious. There is as much suffering caused by these methods as there is in the use of the gin trap.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the main difficulties in abolishing it altogether, and these other methods of trapping is enforcement. It will be extremely difficult to have a small army of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0057">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

policemen or other enforcement officers to make sure that what is wanted is really done. It was the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) I think who suggested prohibition of manufacture. I should have thought that it would have been possible to have put that in this Bill. It may be necessary to amend the 1948 Act but I think it is an essential step to take if we are effectively to ban the use of the gin trap. One of the difficulties of enforcement I came across quite recently. I was cleaning the outfall of a drain. I found my spade made an odd clunk in the ground and I uncovered to my astonishment a gin trap. I do not know who put it there. It was certainly not I, but it was sprung, and, when I hit it with the spade, it went off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Agriculture (Scotland) Act, 1948, it is precisely stated that if one has a sprung trap in his possession for a purpose which is unlawful, he will be guilty of an offence. What will be the position under this Bill? So far as I can see it will make a nonsense of the present legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I also press the Under-Secretary a little further on the question of research? What progress has been made towards providing an alternative trap? He has been extremely vague this morning about this, and I hope he can go a little further when he replies. I, personally, have one suggestion to make and that is that the rabbit clearance society regulations might be amended to include for grant purposes the destruction of foxes. In my area we have a very effective rabbit clearance society with a most efficient trapper. I have no doubt other areas are just as well served. Would it not be possible to give an inducement to these societies in the manner which I have suggested?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baxter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to intervene in this debate but I am probably one of the few people here who make a contribution to eradication of foxes as I do in west Stirlingshire. We have not eradicated all the foxes there, but we are doing our best. Eradication of foxes is difficult, and I think we have to look at this differently from looking at the eradication of other pests. I think the hon. Member has given a practical illustration of what could be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would rather see an order before the House for this purpose than this
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
Bill, in order to bring into operation some method of payment for foxes humanely caught. If there were, for example, £1 a head paid to everyone who brought in a brush, then I think we would go a long way towards eradicating the fox population in Scotland. I fully agree that it is imperative that something more be done without the utilisation of this pernicious thing, the gin trap. After all, it has not been successful in the past and indeed, the fox population is increasing

<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an intervention I made in the speech of my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) I said that even in my part of Stirling we have a number of foxes and they are increasing. It is no use having a discussion here this morning about pious resolutions or pious Bills to be put into operation in the far-distant future if a set of circumstances should arise to permit us to do so. As the hon. Member for Banff (Mr. W. H. K. Baker) said, if one designates foxes as vermin and puts a prize on every brush, and if every person who brings one in is paid, we shall soon eradicate foxes. There may be other suggestions, but the main purpose of this debate is to suggest ways and means of eradicating the fox population.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill does no more than do the powers which are already vested in the Secretary of State. He can operate an order this morning to ban the gin if there is an alternative, but the alternative does not have to be a trap. A pill to control the breeding habits of foxes might qualify as an alternative to the gin. This Bill does not give much hope for the future. I deprecate that in our Parliamentary system of government Ministers introduce Bills without prior consultation with their colleagues and the Opposition. If consultation had taken place, much of the argy-bargy would not have been needed. The Bill has served a useful purpose in giving an opportunity to express points of view, but it would have been as easy to have had a discussion on ways and means to eradicate foxes. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State should introduce a Measure to give £1 to any person—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baxter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not introduced anything about birth control. This was introduced by the Under-Secretary and by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart).

I did not intervene then because I thought the very idea was out of this world. My idea is not a gift scheme and I would like you to withdraw the remarks you have made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have made a practical suggestion for the eradication of the fox population, and it is the only one put forward this morning. The hon. Member for Banff indicated a certain area where 10s. a head or per brush is given.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The money is found for paying that 10s. by a levy on the farmers in the area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baxter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that point but I do not think that farmers in a particular area should be called on to pay this amount for the killing of foxes in that area when there is no way of knowing where the fox was killed. It could have been in another area. There should be a general fox eradication scheme for the whole of Scotland under which anyone who kills a fox and can prove it will be given £1 per tail. This would go a long way to eradicate this difficult problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not follow the hon. Gentleman in his interesting and constructive suggestion. At a time when much lip service is being paid to
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
devolution it strikes me that this measure is a good example of the sort of decision which could be taken on a more local level than it is. Why should the county councils not be empowered to take this decision on whether or not gin traps should be abolished? They know the peculiarities of their counties, and this is recognised because we have a different rule in Scotland from that in England. I am sorry we are not having some devolution in this. If, at this time, when our country is suffering from this problem, the people of Scotland were to ask what the Grand Committee is talking about and were told "gin traps for hours" they would be aghast, as the population were aghast when we were talking last week about House of Lords reform. These things are irrelevant to the problems of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is not possible to have devolution under this Bill can we not look at the abolition of gin traps on a slightly different basis? My hon. Friend agrees with me that we might allow the crofting counties or the Highland counties to continue the gin trap. I am anti gin trap and always have been. I would like to see it abolished immediately south of the Highland line. When people say that one cannot do this without adequate alternatives I believe there is an adequate alternative. In vast areas of the country, foxes are kept under reasonable control and the important instrument is not the gin trap but gassing, a much more humane way of dealing with the situation. Unfortunately it requires much manpower.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to take up the point which the hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Mr. Maclennan) made in his usual fashion. He seldom resists an opportunity of having a dig at the landowners, but he employed a self-contradictory argument when he said that their only interest was in sport and that they were not interested in the protection of sheep and that they employed more gamekeepers. He then said that they had not as many gamekeepers now. This shows that they have more interest in sheep than he thinks. It is only because of the shortage of gamekeepers and the difficulties of management of large estates that gassing methods are not more widely employed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0059">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
We have not had much information from the Under-Secretary on research into alternative methods. What has been done in the last year in the Scottish Office into research into alternative methods? How many have been employed on this? What consultations has the Under-Secretary had with the Forestry Commission, which, in the south-west region of England, and in Wiltshire, has an expert who has studied this matter and devised a large number of different kinds of trap for different animals? Some of them might be an alternative to the gin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sometimes those who try to justify the use of the gin tend to exaggerate the damage done by foxes to sheep. I know from personal experience that there are shepherds who have been unlucky or careless or had trouble and lost their sheep and blamed the poor old fox for something he has not done. I have discovered this on many occasions, when I have found behind a stone dyke a pile of corpses which had not been taken by foxes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not widely known that shepherds put a spot of creosote on a lamb's neck and I have never heard of a fox taking a lamb treated in this way. There are some parts where this method could be used and it could be used more widely than it is at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would the Minister look at the possibility of passing a single-Clause Bill allowing local authorities to decide this matter for themselves?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We all agree that gin traps should be abolished. However, one finds no encouragement in the Bill to think that it will be done, despite the unanimous opinion of the Committee. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State is a humane man, and I have a great affection for him, but the Bill has been weakened because he has not measured up to his job. Since 1958, the gin trap has been abolished in England and Wales. Seventeen years ago, the Report of the Committee set up to inquire into cruelty to animals described it as a "diabolical instrument" which causes an incalculable amount of suffering. Despite all that, we are no nearer dealing with the problem. Why is there this reluctance to ban its use?
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
It is not as though it is controlling the population of foxes in Scotland. In the lowland counties, foxes are increasing rapidly. When I have time in the Summer Recess, I go fishing in the lowland counties, and I know of a number of spots where foxes can be seen. If we are to control their numbers and, at the same time, get rid of the gin trap, whether it is by using a pill or doped carcases, another aspect which will have to be dealt with and to which the Bill does not refer is that of fox hunting. In the southern counties of Scotland there are certain foxhunting fraternities, and the fox cannot be hunted unless it is bred and kept. As a result, emanating from areas where foxhunting clubs are strong, affluent, and hold many meets, there is bound to be a spread of foxes into other areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir John Gilmour</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely, the whole purpose of a pack of foxhounds is to destroy foxes. It is an additional alternative to the gin trap.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is against everything which we hear from those who support the sport which the hon. Gentleman is now endeavouring to safeguard. They maintain that it is not the death of the fox which is important, and that, very often, the fox escapes. Then again, only one fox is involved, with a horde of men, women and horses chasing it through farms, very often to the great dismay of tenant farmers who complain about the destruction of their crops.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir J. Gilmour</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has it wrong. It is the pack of hounds, trained to kill, which pursues the fox. The horses have nothing to do with killing the fox.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But there would be no sport in it if the hounds ran away and left the men and horses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to control the fox population, and my hon. Friend will need to take appropriate measures. At the same time, I hope that he will convey it to his right hon. Friend that he cannot go two ways at once. He cannot accept a system which fosters the breeding of foxes in some areas to meet the desires of the fox hunting fraternity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would concur in what my hon. Friend the Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Mr. Maclennan) said. When I was a boy, there were many more gamekeepers
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0060">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
keeping down vermin on large estates. In those days, there were too many keepers for me, but there are very few now. It is possible to fish almost anywhere now as long as one takes only brown trout. Sea trout and salmon are watched more carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the beginning of all the agitation against gin traps, the main concern was for rabbits, but we have all seen pet dogs mauled by traps and great cruelty caused. The arguments against the use of gin traps to keep down the rabbit population have largely disappeared, because myxomatosis has virtually cleared the Highlands. One hardly sees a rabbit nowadays. The argument has now moved to the fox, but it has to be recognised that the Bill does not take matters very much further. If gin traps can be banned in England and Wales, we can do the same in Scotland tomorrow. We are putting on the trap a value which it does not possess, and I say that as one who was born and bred in the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to the Bill, the appointed day is to be 1st April, 1973. However, when one reads on, one finds in Clause 2 (1)(	<i>b</i>) that the appointed day can be delayed for a period or a further period of one year. Does that mean another two years, which could take it to 1975 before the appointed day must come? Can we be assured that the Bill will come into operation no later than 1975?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Wolrige-Gordon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the Minister did not give us more evidence about the number of foxes in the country. What estimate has he made about the increase in numbers, and what is the background against which he has made his decision perhaps or perhaps not to abolish the gin trap in 1973?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can well understand the feeling against these gin traps. When emotions are outraged by the use of a cruel instrument, the normal solution is to abolish it. But nature is cruel, and our own civilisation has not always been humane. Cruelty must be accepted before it can be cured, and, in this case, curing it has been quite unsuccessful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn) said that he had hoped in 1948 that an alternative method would be found. But he must have known that a vague hope of finding
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
a solution is not enough. Unless someone decides to take responsibility and work towards an alternative, it will never appear. It has not appeared in the intervening 20 years, but now the Under-Secretary of State brings forward a Bill which, he says, will make us think much harder, and a solution will appear very soon. He has referred to the possibility of a reproductive inhibitant. Why does he use nonsensical jargon like that? I hope that an alternative will be found, but I am more than a little sceptical about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The evidence that we have heard from hon. Members representing constituencies in all parts of Scotland is that the fox population is increasing. As a result, it might be argued that the gin trap and the bonus scheme do not work and, therefore, that we must wash our hands of the problem. However, the gin trap does work. The hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel) flew in the face of the evidence put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) about the effectiveness of the trap and the number of foxes killed in the crofting counties. His figures have not been challenged. He said that, of the 1.530 foxes destroyed, 84 per cent. were killed by the gin trap. If the figures are wrong, I hope that the Minister will tell us. There is evidence that the trap has an important effect in controlling the fox population and, as yet, there is no visible alternative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister abolishes the gin trap, he must accept that he will expose our livestock population to even greater depredation by foxes. If that happens, I hope that he will consider the payment of some form of compensation, because, undoubtedly, there will be considerable increases in losses if foxes are allowed to flourish even more than at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the closing remarks of the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. Wolrige-Gordon). He seems to be the only hon. Member who recognises that I propose to abolish the gin trap. My hon. Friend the Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel) felt sorry for me and said that until now he had regarded me as a humane man. One would think that the Bill proposed to introduce the gin trap. It proposes to abolish it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to deal with the points which have been raised in the debate. I think that the point about time was put best, as always, by my hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. W. Baxter), who said that the abolition would be a matter for the dim and distant future when and if a set of circumstances arose to allow us to do it. That is not what the Bill says. It is suggested that the Bill's provisions will be enforced only if the humane alternative is found. That is not in the Bill, nor is it implied. Second, it is suggested that its provisions will only be enforced when scientific research has reached a certain point. That is not in the Bill, nor is it implied. Third, it is suggested that, if circumstances arise which enable us to ban the use of gin traps, we shall do so. In fact, the opposite is the case. We are putting down 1973 as being the date on which the gin trap will be abolished. However, if circumstances improve, if the humane alternative is found beforehand, under the 1948 Act we can ban it immediately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Within three years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We can revert to the 1948 Act. Under the provisions of that Act, regardless of the present Bill, we can bring in another Measure, because the requirement will have been met. If the 1948 Act were appropriate and the humane alternative were brought in, we could use the 1948 Act to abolish the gin trap at that point. There is no problem in bringing it forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The anxiety which has risen concerns deferment. My right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis), in an interjection, mentioned the year 2000, and another of my hon. Friends referred to the dim and distant future. I am clear that 1973, or sooner, is the date we have in mind. Why do we introduce the possibility of deferment? Not to wait for a set of circumstances to arise which will let us do so, but because nobody can predict a situation in four year's time. The events of the last few years have given us all warnings about predictions. I do not know what the situation will be in four years. If the hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Mr.
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
Maclennan) knows what the situation will be in four years, he should say so. If the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) knows what it will be in four years, he should say so. I do not know. I cannot envisage the situation. Discretion should be left to those whose responsibility it will be to deal with that situation to bring in the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East may be anxious about it, we are putting it in his hands by having any deferment order put through the House of Commons where everyone is keen to have the gin trap abolished quickly. Therefore, no deferment need take place, because it would be subject to Prayer and negative resolution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary misunderstands what the hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Mr. Maclennan) and I were getting at. The Secretary of State has the power under the Act. He could do it tomorow or in four years. Therefore, the Bill is quite unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is irrelevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the point that I tried to explain earlier in one or two interventions. I wish that the hon. Member were right. A lot of problems would be solved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the hon. Member is usually right. With his customary modesty, he assumes that on this occasion also he is right, but I regret that he is not. Section 50(5)(	<i>a</i>) of the Act says,
	<br><blockquote><p>"… if he is satisfied having regard to the quantities of approved traps available …"</p></blockquote>
I am saying that this can only be introduced if the humane alternative is produced. I accept that in those circumstances what the hon. Gentleman says would be true. But we are saying that we will bring it in whether the humane alternative is introduced or not. The Secretary of State cannot act under the 1948 Act unless an alternative is introduced which satisfies Section 50(5)(	<i>a</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Also the Secretary of State has to be satisfied, under Section 50(5)(	<i>b</i>) that it is no longer necessary; that is, that circumstances have changed sufficiently. That
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0062">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
is the only power he has under the 1948 Act—the existence of an alternative or if circumstances change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we are saying that we intend to abolish the gin trap whether or not there is an alternative or the circumstances have changed. The powers for that do not presently exist. This is the advice of the Law Officers on this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman does not seem to appreciate that the burden of the criticism is not, as he puts it, that the 1948 Act provides the same powers as this Bill, but that Clause 2(1,b) drives a coach and horses through the principle of abolishing the gin trap in 1973. It is no more than a pious expression of intention. Unless the Government are prepared to withdraw that Clause we cannot look upon it as anything else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brachan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a matter for the Committee. I am prepared to hear the arguments of the Committee. I am astonished that hon. Members should attempt to forecast what the situation will be in four years' time. I do not know what the situation will be in four years' time. The people responsible for administering the situation then should be left with the discretion to look at it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no intention to defer it. Deferment will depend on Parliament allowing it to be deferred after an assessment of this situation. It may only arise if there is a gross or catastrophic change in the situation. I hope that if such a situation arose my hon. Friend would be prepared to have another look at this in four years' time. I am responsible for Scottish agriculture, and for the first time I would give him a little advice on his responsibility for his constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether I might put this one point as succinctly as I can to the hon. Gentleman?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot tell the hon. Gentleman what caused the Department to change its mind if I do not know what caused it to give him that advice in the first place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is my advice, and, above all, the advice of the Law Officers. Hon. Members may think that I am inhumane, because at long last I am proceeding to abolish the gin trap, but allowing four years to do it. I am pleased to be abolishing the gin trap. I want it done. But I am at least as competent as hon. Members of saying, "Is there no easier way of doing it?". Would they at least give me the credit of being able to say, "Does not existing legislation allow us to do it?". If hon. Members think that I get great pleasure from trying to explain a complicated piece of legislation when I could have done it by a simple order, as they are suggesting, they are mistaken, and might do themselves and me a little more credit. We cannot do it under the existing legislation, because it is qualified by Section 50(5,	<i>a</i>) and (	<i>b</i>). Therefore, we have to do it this way.

I suggest that this will have certain advantages. First, it will allow various methods to be attempted—gassing and shooting—to see what is suitable for different areas. Secondly, it will put extra pressure on research people to come up with results. But, further, we should leave the discretion open—not make it obligatory—for Parliament at that time in the light of the prevailing situation, to decide whether any deferment Order should then be made. This is what the Bill says.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does not need an order for section 50(5)(	<i>b</i>).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. I am getting anxious. The Under-Secretary obviously has a lot of questions to answer. Will it be possible to run past one o'clock to allow him reply?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Frankly, I would not have thought it necessary, but in view of the interruptions which have taken place, I have no objection if hon. Members wish to continue till 1.15. Mr. Buchan.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East wished to come in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the first place, it does not require an order to bring the Bill into effect, so Parliament will not be able to discuss on 1st April, 1973. The hon. Gentleman says that, irrespective of whether there are suitable traps or not, they intend to abolish the gin trap in 1973. If there are no suitable alternative methods of catching foxes, the fox population will increase. Is that the position?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that my right hon. Friend still fails to distinguish between the humane approved alternative and existing alternative methods which are used—shooting, gassing, and the friends of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North (Earl of Dalkeith). Alternative methods are in use, and these will be intensified. But the humane alternative trap, which was the subject set before
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
the Humane Traps Panel, is not necessary before the gin trap is abolished. Does my right hon. Friend take the point now? In that case we can get on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it the intention of the Bill to give legal notice to the people of Scotland that the gin trap will be abolished in 1973 and it is up to them to make arrangements in the meantime.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the Bill is to set a date when the gin trap will be abolished unless the Secretary of State, approved by Parliament, decides to bring it forward or to push it back. It will be up to Parliament—it is the first time I have heard of Parliament not wanting to give itself powers—to do this if it so decides.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I am not wrong and that my hon. Friend will not say that I am too hard on him—I am not usually—but Clause 2(1)(	<i>b</i>) says that the Secretary of State
	<br><blockquote><p>"may, whether an Order has been made under the foregoing paragraph or not, from time to time by order postpone the appointed day for a period, or further period, of one year."</p></blockquote>
Does that mean we could get to 1975?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have already said this. It may be that Parliament, in its wisdom, decides to defer it. It may not only be 1975; it may be the year 2,000, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East said. But this gives the power to Parliament to decide. The Secretary of State must bring in an order under Clause 2(3), and Parliament can annul it. It will be subject to negative resolution. It is bringing in powers whereby Parliament will decide. Do hon. Members not want the opportunity to decide? Is this their problem?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does Clause 2(1)(	<i>b</i>) mean that there will not be an order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is confusing two different orders. Clause 2(1)(	<i>b</i>) says,
	<br><blockquote><p>"… whether an order has been made under the foregoing paragraph or not…"</p></blockquote>
That is, whether by that time an order has been brought in bringing it forward. Whether an order has been brought in bringing it forward or not, it may still be deferred by a further order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or a further period.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will be up to Parliament to decide. I always thought this was the power of Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Parliament does not decide this. The initiative for bringing in an order lies with the Government, not Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend is right this time. It will be brought in by the Secretary of State, but it can be rejected by Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a different matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The problem was the objection to deferment. The argument is not that Parliament should have the right to introduce deferment, but that Parliament should have the right to reject it. We have given Parliament the power to do this. If my right hon. Friend seeks to open up deferment, we will be opening up a fresh line of thought.

	<p>	<i>And it being One o'clock,</i> The CHAIRMAN, 	<i>pursuant to Standing Order No. 66 (Meetings of standing committees), deferred adjourning the Committee.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire raised a constructive point, asking if it was possible to deal with the fox problem by the payment of a £1 bonus for every brush. I am told that there are difficulties in this. Sometimes such a payment merely leads to killing those foxes which can in any case be killed by other methods, leaving the survivors better feeding and breeding conditions. The method would not basically root out the fox population. I am not rejecting it, but merely stating the difficulties. It tends to leave the problem of litters which have been gassed in dens, for instance. Therefore, it is not the whole solution.

A number of questions were asked on how the Humane Traps Panel is constituted. It consists of a Chairman and four members, with assessors from the Department of Agriculture and the Forestry Commission. It has advertised a monetary award of up to £2,000 for the development of a humane trap, and this is advertised in the Press and announced on Scottish television news. So far, 43 designs have been produced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
The award is well known to those of inventive habits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is there a possibility of producing an alternative? I cannot say. Hon. Members are confident about the future. I am not. It is a very difficult task.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is 14 years since the Pests Act was passed in 1954. The same four-year period was given in England. Therefore, we are not dragging our feet. This is the normal way in which this kind of ecological change should be taken care of by man. The search for an alternative has gone on all through that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have examined cage traps, holding traps, and killing traps. None of these has proved very satisfactory. Two holding traps are being tested. Both would catch the leg without inflicting injury, but they are cumbersome, inefficient and expensive at present. There is another using a system of rubber pads on the gin, which may be more promising. We cannot say yet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Banff (Mr. W. H. K. Baker) raised the question of small vermin. The gin trap is permitted for foxes and otters, otters with the drowning set only. Article 2 of the Spring Traps Order, 1958, covers this point. There are a number of approved traps available for rats and other small vermin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of the fox destruction clubs was raised, and I agree that it is very important. A proposal has been put to me by the Scottish Landowners' Federation and the National Farmers' Union for the establishment of pest control societies with the same kind of grants as rabbit clearance societies have, not only on this issue but for a number of different pests. We have raised the matter with the Advisory Council advising on rats and other land pests. I shall make sure that the implications for destruction clubs of the ban on the use of the gin trap—we certainly intend to abolish it—are taken into account before any decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One or two hon. Members raised the problem of abolishing the gin trap in different areas. We are introducing the Bill basically on humanitarian principles. It would be at variance with those principles if we let the gin trap be kept in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0065">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>49</span>
those areas where foxes are particularly difficult to control, because there is no need to introduce it in other areas. If we authorised the use of the gin trap in, say, the crofting counties, it would be difficult to say that it would not spread into adjacent areas. I am sure that it is correct to introduce a comprehensive and total ban.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alasdair Mackenzie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Since there is a special problem in the crofting counties. Would it not be in order to defer the date of banning while research is going on? With regard to what has already been said about making a payment for the brush and giving incentives for fox destruction, this would touch only the fringe of the problem; I do not think that this would deal with the hinterland areas. As the money has to be provided by flockmasters in the area, I think there are some proprietors and farmers who would not subscribe towards the fund.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware of those points and have sympathy with the aims involved, but the hon. Member has raised the question of payment. We have recognised the difficulty here, and those who will ignore the situation are the people that he will have to convince. I agree that the difficulties are more in his area, but I want to bring the scheme into operation in a universal form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, North, asked if this matter could be left to local decision—to local option, so to speak. I have a feeling that it would be abolished overnight in Glasgow but I am not so sure about Ross and Cromarty and the Borders. I have no worry about foxes in the Gorbals, and I think we can put this in as a matter of policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does that mean that the Under-Secretary does not trust the local authorities, who know what the conditions are in their areas, to form a reasonable judgment, possibly better than his own on this point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I think they are very competent to decide what the problem is, but we also think there may be a genuine conflict of interest. That is why we have a four years' deferment. We recognise that at some time Governments have a responsibility to weigh the
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
interests and see what is the correct and humane thing to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary mentioned the Gorbals and he may recall that he recently had a conference on violence. Would it not be a good thing to take these lads up to the Highlands to use their violence on routing out the foxes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have really covered a lot of points and in the little time left to me I want to refer to the survey. It shows that something like 10,000 foxes were killed in 1965–66 and that about one-third of those were taken by the gin trap. In the Highlands, this figure was 46 per cent., and in the Counties of Moray, Nairn, Banff, Aberdeen, and Kincardine, 62 per cent. The gin trap is an important weapon in fox control, but experience also indicates that other methods are possible. Those are methods I want to sharpen up and it is because we recognise that the change will be difficult in some areas that we want the four years' interval. The cost of starting will be about £15,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard of chemicals to disrupt the reproductive processes of the foxes. At the moment we are still discussing and investigating through the Ministry of Agriculture's scientific staff, our Department's scientific staff and Aberdeen University, studies on the biology of the fox. We are learning from abroad, and particularly from the United States, where they are looking at the effects of anti-fertility agents in capitive red foxes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not got through all the points raised and I must apologise to those whose specific points I have missed, but I have been left no time to give answers. I have had to spell out in considerable detail a simple and obvious Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that hon. Members recognise that we are taking a decision regardless of whether we find a humane alternative or not, whether to put into the hands of Parliament the right to implement this in four years' time or not. The object is to abolish the gin trap, and I am glad that there has been agreement on that this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
