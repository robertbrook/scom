<div class='page-header'><h1>EDUCATION (SCOTLAND) BILL</h1></div>
<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Bruce Millan)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That during the further proceedings on the Education (Scotland) Bill the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock, on Thursday, 6th March, at Four o'clock, and, with effect from Wednesday, 12th March, on Wednesdays at Four o'clock.</p></blockquote>
This is a Motion of which I gave notice at our meeting last Thursday, but it is in slightly different terms from the notice I gave then. At that time I hoped I should be able to move a Motion that we have the normal Tuesday and Thursday Sittings, and Sittings on Wednesdays at 4 o'clock in the afternoon, but it was represented to me briefly last Thursday, and it has been represented to me since, that it would be unfortunate to meet on Wednesday of this week at 4 o'clock, because the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs will be having its first meeting on Wednesday of this week at 5 o'clock, and a considerable number of Members of this Committee are also Members of the Select Committee. To meet that circumstance, I suggest that this week we should meet not on Wednesday but on Thursday at 4 o'clock, and that we should revert to Wednesdays as from next week.<br><br>
I am not sure, as matters now stand, when the Select Committee at its first meeting will decide subsequently to meet. I hope very much that it will take account of the fact that next week, at least if this Motion is accepted, we hope to meet in this Committee on Wednesday at 4 o'clock. I also hope very much that we shall not go beyond next week with this Bill, and that with this week's Sittings and next week's Sittings we shall finish it. If the Select Committee decides otherwise, I shall certainly be glad to take any decision of that Committee into account, but as things stand now, since we cannot be sure when the Select Committee is going to meet after Wednesday of this week, it would be better for every-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 428</span>
one concerned if we reverted to Wednesdays from next week, because Thursday is normally a rather inconvenient day for Members to sit in the afternoon.<br><br>
I am anxious that we should have each week an afternoon Sitting rather than an additional morning Sitting for the obvious reason that afternoon Sittings are not specifically limited in time and I wish that we should make progress on the Bill.<br><br>
We have had nine Sittings so far, during which we have dealt with seven Clauses. Seven of the Sittings were principally taken up with Clause 1, which included a controversial provision. I am not in any way complaining about the length of time that we have taken on the Bill so far. If hon. Gentlemen wish, as they obviously do, and as they obviously have the right to do, to discuss some of these important Clauses at considerable length, I certainly would not complain about that, but I have to protect the rest of the Government business which is to come before the Standing Committee subsequent to this Bill.<br><br>
I need only mention, for example, the very important Housing Bill which is still to come along, which deals with the recommendations of the Cullingworth Committee on older houses, and also with the question of Government assistance for Glasgow storm damage. Then there is the Town and Country Planning Bill, which is another important Bill to come along later, and we have the usual provision for Estimates days and so on. If we are to get all the business through and protect Estimates days and matter days it is necessary to make rather quicker progress with the Education (Scotland) Bill than we have been able to make so far.<br><br>
I hope, therefore, that if this Sittings Motion is accepted this morning, we can make considerable progress this week and, if need be, if the debates on the Bill go over into next week, that we can also make considerable progress then and finish the Bill next week at the latest. If we can finish it before that, I should be very pleased indeed. But that is the sort of progress I have in mind now.<br><br>
It seems to me that we shall not need excessively late afternoon Sittings on this basis, but I am afraid that if I do not move today, and have accepted, this Sittings Motion, a Sittings Motion will
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0684">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 429</span>
still be required a little later, and we may then have to have excessively long Sittings, which I should certainly hope to avoid on a Bill of this nature. It is with those considerations in mind that I move the Motion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian MacArthur</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister very courteously gave notice at our last meeting that it was his intention to move a Sittings Motion today; but the Motion which he has just moved is not the Motion of which he gave us notice. I am not complaining about that, because the change affecting this week is a switch from the proposed meeting on Wednesday afternoon to a meeting on Thursday afternoon. The reason for that, as the Minister explained, is that a meeting on Wednesday of this week would clash with the first meeting of the Select Committee. I am sure my hon. Friends agree it is right that on Wednesday of this week we should not clash with the Select Committee, but should meet at some other time. I think we indicated to the Minister last week that we would not oppose a Motion to sit an extra afternoon this week, and, inconvenient as Thursday afternoon may be to some of us, the Minister has acted reasonably in proposing that we should meet on Thursday instead of Wednesday this week.<br><br>
At that point, I am afraid that I must put some questions to the Minister. I am not at all content that we should accept a Motion to sit on Wednesday of next week. As yet we have no indication at all as to the intentions of the Select Committee. That Committee will meet tomorrow and, in view of the importance of that Committee, it would be quite wrong if we here were to take action which might cramp or hamper that Committee in any way at all. It is possible that the Select Committee might decide tomorrow to meet next Wednesday at 4 or 5 o'clock, which would render our meeting at 4 o'clock quite intolerable. It might, for all we know, decide to meet in Edinburgh on Wednesday of next week, and if that were to be the decision it would be quite wrong for this Committee to take action which would make it extremely difficult for Members of the Select Committee to adhere to the programme arranged by the Select Committee itself. So this proposal that we should
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 430</span>
meet on Wednesday of next week needs to be very carefully studied and considered this morning.<br><br>
I am glad the Minister made it clear that he was not complaining about the time which has been devoted to this Bill. If he looks through the Hansard Reports, he will see that the balance of time has been fairly evenly divided between both sides of the Committee. We have taken great care to debate this Bill carefully, and the Minister himself said that it was our right to do so. I would go further than that, and say that it is our duty to debate this Bill carefully; in particular, those Clauses which provide for changes in our educational structure which are very wide ranging in their intent.<br><br>
The Motion this morning is a reflection of the total muddle into which the Government have got themselves. We know already that they are unable to manage the country. We see yet again today that they cannot even manage their own programme in the House of Commons. I am very sorry indeed that a result of this should be a threat to the freedom of the Select Committee, which all of us have wanted to see exist.<br><br>
I am sorry, too, that, buried in the Minister's remarks just now, there should have been a threat to the Estimates days and the matter days which we debate every year and which, in my experience in the House, have never been interfered with before by Government blackmail. I hope that, when he replies to the debate, the Minister will assure us that it is not his intention to interfere with the Estimates days and the matter days. I hope, too, that he will consider again that part of his Motion which would interfere with the Sittings of the Select Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Anthony Stodart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Committee for my absence from a number of Sittings, but I can assure hon. Members that the deliberations of the Scottish Standing Committee never seem so interesting as they do when one is compelled to be absent, particularly when one is sick. However, I have read every word that has been said.<br><br>
I should like to say to the hon. Gentleman—and I speak entirely for myself on this matter—that I think the Government were extremely reasonable in the amount
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0685">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 431</span>
of time they gave us on Clause I. I have absolutely no complaint about that, and I thought the Minister behaved generously. It also seems to me that, no doubt due, Mr. Jennings, to your admirable Chairmanship and impartiality, the arguments have been remarkably level in length—though not, of course, in content—from each side of the Committee. Suspecting that the day might come when this Motion would be moved I took a note of the amount of time occupied by each side of the Committee. I think I am right in saying that, up to date, the Opposition have filled some 212 columns of HANSARD and the Government side have occupied 200.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They include the Minister's speeches.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stodart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Therefore, there is no question—and it has not been suggested—that the Opposition have been holding up the Bill. It shows there was a good deal of substance in the Bill, which hon. Gentlemen on each side wanted to discuss.<br><br>
I suspect, in view of what the Minister has told us about the heavy legislative programme which is to follow upon this measure, that the Government totally underestimated the time which this Bill would require if it was to be adequately discussed by Members on both sides. I was staggered when, before the Committee started work on the Bill, I was informed by someone, who was in a position to know what the Government anticipated, that they thought this Bill might go through in five Sittings. I raised my eyebrows and whistled when I heard that. If that is the case, then I do not think the Government can come before this Committee and plead Town and Country Planning Bills, Housing Bills and others, which are, no doubt, of great importance, as an excuse for moving this Sittings Motion.<br><br>
10.45 a.m.<br><br>
I conclude by making an appeal on behalf of my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis). He is not a constituent of mine, but I have asked leave of my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North (Earl of Dalkeith), to plead the right hon. Gentleman's case for him, because, as everyone of his colleagues on each side of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 432</span>
Committee knows, the right hon. Gentleman is not one who very readily changes his mind. I cannot recall his having given expression on many occasions passionately, evocatively and provocatively to the desire to retreat at any future date, be it near or far, from the point of view that he has taken up. I recall that my heart used to sink when he advanced into the House or into this Committee armed with barbs to throw at the Government Bench, but now we are both mellowing and I am anxious to put in a word for him. I freely admit that one has to get back——</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I would like to know what this has to do with the Sittings Motion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is just wasting time again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am asking the hon. Member to come to the point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stodart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg your pardon, Mr. Jennings. My affection for the right hon. Gentleman has carried me away. I remind you and the Committee of the passionate plea which he made on a previous Sittings Motion, and this is a matter of which we are entitled to take account. The right hon. Gentleman, I suspect, now feels it impossible, from fear of what would happen to him, either from the Whip, or from the Minister, to express his feelings in the way he did on one occasion when an afternoon Sittings Motion was proposed. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"… My colleagues and I are to be denied the right to attend the business that we have been sent here to do."</p></blockquote>
How I wish that I could catch the tone with which he made these remarks, but hon. Members will be able to recall it for themselves.
<br><blockquote><p>"Could anything be more fantastic and unreasonable? No member with democratic responsibility to his electors could for one moment support that."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>Scottish Standing Committee</i>, 19th March, 1957; c. 18.]</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Motion is before us because we are being pressed to finish the Education (Scotland) Bill. Members of the Committee will agree that, broadly speaking, about the same amount of time has been spent on each side of the Committee in speaking to the Bill, and therefore it is not the way in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0686">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 433</span>
which the Bill has been handled in Committee that has caused the pressure to be put on us to accept the Motion. It is because the Government are trying to get too much legislation through the Grand Committee and this Standing Committee.<br><br>
The Government must accept a reprimand for not beginning the business of the Scottish Commitee until 19th November of this Session. The Session began on 30th October and four or five Sitting days were lost before the Government were in a position to bring forward the Electricity (Scotland) Bill and the Agriculture (Spring Traps) (Scotland) Bill. We finished the Committee stage of the Agriculture (Spring Traps) Scotland Bill on 12th December. Sitting days were lost before the Christmas Recess. The Government must take the blame for the dilatory procedure of business before Christmas.<br><br>
The Government must look at what they are trying to push through the Committee between now and July to see whether, instead of having Second Reading in Grand Committee, it should be taken on the Floor of the House. We have ahead of us the Second Reading of the Housing (Scotland) Bill, which will be a few days, the Committee stage of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Bill, which could take 14 Sittings, and the Housing Bill Committee which could require 12 or 14 Sittings on that long and important Bill. There is also the Second Reading of the Measure on the age of majority, which means another two days in Grand Committee; there will be the Committee stage of that Bill. There are also the Estimates days. This means that there will be about 38 or 40 Sittings of the Grand Committee or the Standing Committee between now and the end of July.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</span><span class='membercontribution'>: And the matter days.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: And the matter days, in accordance with the agreement between the Government and the Opposition.<br><br>
If this is so, it would appear that the Government's timetable has gone hopelessly out of order. We are reaching the stage when there is insufficient time for the discussion of legislation in this Committee. I accept that on Clause 1 we may have had adequate time, but why should the last few Clauses and the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 434</span>
Schedules go through on the nod? Legislation that has been rushed through Committee causes trouble later on. The Education (Scotland) Bill has proceeded at about the right tempo, with fair and detailed discussion, with no time-wasting. I do not see why, just because it suits the Government's timetable, that we should be told to get cracking and get it finished. It is a wrong attitude, and the Government must take their share of the blame for starting the Bill so late in the Session.<br><br>
The Electricity (Scotland) Bill and the Agriculture (Spring Traps) (Scotland) Bill floated around St. Andrew's House for a couple of years or more. Why could not the Government have had them ready for Second Reading in the Grand Committee during the week after the Queen's Speech? It is the Government's time wasting in the early days of the Session that comes back on to the members of the Committee now. If the Government are still in power in the next Session they must have legislation ready for an immediate start and not drag their heels for three or four weeks.<br><br>
It is most unfortunate that the Government have had to move this Motion, and I support my hon. Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) that we should not accept Wednesday of next week till we know what is to happen about the Select Committee. I hope that the Minister understands that all five Members of the Select Committee from this side are also Members of this Committee on this Bill and it would be difficult for the Committee to operate without those five Members.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Richard Buchanan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I just want to make a complaint about the draught.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, indeed. I have been watching the reactions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order—[HON. MEMBERS: "Oh, no"]—Oh, yes. My hon. Friend is complaining about the draught that is coming from the window. I want to complain about the draught that is coming from the other side of the Committee. Can you do anything about that, Mr. Jennings?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is not a point of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward M. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is just the kind of thing that——</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0687">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 435</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Let us not pursue the point. I have said that it was not a point of order. Mr. Taylor—the Sittings Motion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) has shown his usual statesmanlike behaviour, moderation and reasonableness in dealing with the Motion. I do not look at it in exactly the same light. My hon. Friend in what he said was too kind to the Government. What is the situation which has caused the Motion to come before us? The Government have brought forward in this Bill and other Bills highly controversial and objectionable Measures, and they are now asking for the assistance of the Opposition to help them out of the chaotic congestion which has been created in their timetable. It is not the job of the Opposition to help the Government out of the situation which they have created by bringing forward these highly controversial and objectionable Measures in their legislative programme.<br><br>
I was worried by what the Minister said about the form that afternoon sittings on Thursday of this week and on Wednesday in future weeks would take. He said that he hoped they would finish at a reasonable hour, but if it were not possible to do this then they would have to continue, presumably, very late.<br><br>
One worrying thing about the present Parliamentary system is that important Measures which affect the lives of the people whom we represent are being discussed by a crowd of sleepyheads very late at night and sometimes in the early hours of the morning. While we on this side of the Committee may be burning the midnight oil, it appears from what was said yesterday that we may also be burning the midnight oil downstairs on another important Bill, the Parliament (No. 2) Bill. Is this sensible democracy? Is it reasonable that we should be sitting round the clock? We cannot discuss matters sensibly at unreasonable hours, and to suggest that we should sit here at 2 o'clock, 3 o'clock or 4 o'clock in the morning discussing the future of children in Scottish schools is an insult to the educational system which has been built up in Scotland over many years.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 436</span>
Apart from anything else, we have to consider what business is being discussed downstairs. On Thursday, when it is suggested that we should sit, the House will be discussing the Government's wide-ranging plans for the new Pensions Bill, a desperately important Measure involving millions of pounds a week——</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We cannot go into the details of the business downstairs. It is in order to refer to them, but not to go into the details of such Measures.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. J. Bruce-Gardyne</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. I wonder, Mr. Jennings, if you could elaborate slightly on your Ruling. Surely, the nature of legislation which Members of this Committee may be denied the opportunity of participating in downstairs is a matter for the consideration of the Committee on the Sittings Motion? Is this not a relevant consideration to our thinking this morning?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not relevant to go into the details of such Measures. I was trying to stem the hon. Member's flood of oratory from flowing too wide. I was suspicious that the hon. Member was going into a full flood of oratory about that Bill, and I thought it was time to step in. I will not allow details of Measures downstairs to be discussed now. The argument by reference to them is all right, but not details.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to get through as quickly as possible. If an important Measure is to come before us on Thursday, one which many of us would wish to debate, surely another day could be suggested?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, indeed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What is wrong with Friday? This would be an ideal day, because the Measures which are discussed in Parliament on Friday are not usually quite so important to Scottish constituencies. If we sat on Friday, this would not conflict with what is happening in the House.<br><br>
I hope all Ministers will bear in mind the effect on the health of Members of Parliament of having to sit round the clock. The Members of this Committee are amongst the conscientious Members of the House of Commons, in that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0688">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 437</span>
most of the Members of this Committee are present during morning or late night Sittings in the House. It is utter madness to add further to this burden by suggesting not merely late Sittings of the House to discuss the Government's crazy plans for the House of Lords, but also Sittings till 3 o'clock or 4 o'clock in the morning——</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Plans agreed by the Opposition Front Bench.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would love to enter a discussion on that, but I know you will not allow it, Mr. Jennings.<br><br>
It is utter madness that we should add further to the burden. We will not discuss Measures sensibly and produce sensible legislation if we are to have late Sittings. We have only to look at the legislation recently produced to see the result of proceeding like that. I cannot go into details, but if hon. Members were to look at the results of what we have been doing in Parliament over the last two or three years, and at the situation which has been created by the legislation we have produced, they will see that something has been going seriously wrong. We are producing the wrong type of legislation and are not giving it adequate consideration. Although there has been a dreadful muddle over economic and social matters, let us make sure that we can keep Scottish education apart and produce sensible legislation which has been adequately discussed.<br><br>
11.0 a.m.<br><br>
The remarkable and unusual suggestion by this Minister, with the threat tc our Estimates days and matter days demonstrates a complete contempt for the traditional rights of Scottish Members to discuss their own affairs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentlemar carries this too far, I did not threater the Estimates days at all. I said that one of the reasons we wanted to make progres: was, so that we could find adequate time for Estimates days.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What is that bu a threat?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. It comes to the same thing. The Minister is a polite anc courteous person, but a suggestion of this sort, as to the situation if we do no
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 438</span>
get the legislation through, is a hidden threat to the traditional rights of Scottish Members. I object to it very strongly. In conclusion, Mr. Jennings, since I see you are getting a little impatient——</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I am not. The hon. Member must not think that if I intervene in his speeches, I am curbing him. I think this is the second occasion he has thought so. I have no desire to limit the length of individual Members' speeches. That is entirely up to them. They must keep within order, but I have no jurisdiction over time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Having been only five years in Parliament, I am getting fed up with the way in which this Government are using jackboot tactics to steamroller through legislation. It is time it was stopped.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am astonished at the ingratitude of hon. Members opposite. For 13 years they moved Motions to meet in the afternoons. We pointed out all the difficulties, but they argued that afternoon was the best time. It suited them, it was convenient to them, and it fitted in with everything they wanted to do. We did not accept it at the time, as the hon. Gentleman has demonstrated by the quotation from one of my, I suppose, rather numerous speeches on this matter. But now that the Minister has gone out of his way to pay some attention to the arguments which were advanced so vigorously for 13 years they condemn him. This is ingratitude of an amazing order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would not the right hon. Gentleman agree that, during those 13 years to which he refers, the sort of legislation which was being discussed downstairs in the afternoons was legislation wholly beneficial to Scotland? It was, therefore, not legislation in which hon. Members felt obliged to participate so urgently and anxiously. Unfortunately this is not the position today. That is the difference between the two situations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Obviously the people of Scotland did not think so, because they cleared out half the Members opposite and gave us the biggest number of hon. Members we have ever had. That was the opinion of the Scottish people about legislation then passing through the House.<br><br>
This is an amazing demonstration by hon. Members opposite of how they want
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0689">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 439</span>
to ride two horses at once. Just because they are now in Opposition, they want to pursue these points and disagree with the Motion on afternoon Sittings. I have never liked afternoon Sittings, but I am willing to fit in with what hon. Gentlemen opposite pursuaded us to accept for 13 years.<br><br>
It might be a good thing to sit on Thursday afternoon since business on the Floor of the House on Thursday will conclude at 10 o'clock. We shall then have another eight or ten clear hours in which we shall not conflict with business on the Floor of the House. We shall be able to sit here through the peaceful hours of the night discussing intelligently the Education (Scotland) Bill. No doubt if we sit to 8, 9 or 10 o'clock on Friday morning we shall be able to get through a considerable part of the Bill. I shall look forward to hearing what hon. Gentlemen have to say about the rest of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stodart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a little difficult to hear the right hon. Gentleman when he has his tongue so much in his cheek.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall look forward to hearing hon. Gentlemen opposite. We have had many an all-night Sitting in this Committee. The level of discussion at times may have fallen a little low. That was when Members opposite, then on the Government side, used to sit like a bunch of Trappist monks completely gagged behind their Minister—unlike Members on this side, who enjoy a certain amount of freedom, freedom which has never been enjoyed by hon. Gentlemen opposite. I look forward to the debate on Thursday night and Friday morning and I hope that we get a fair amount of the Bill dealt with. I find the early hours of the morning, 2, 3 and 4 o'clock, to be some of the best hours for thinking clearly. I am sure we shall do quite well. If we cannot get very far, there is nothing much on the Floor of the House on Friday. We could carry through to Friday, and probably on Saturday morning we could catch our trains feeling that we had done a good job of work for Scotland. We shall get back to Edinburgh or Glasgow, or wherever it may be, thinking, "Well done. We have put in a good stint of work for Scotland." I do not know why hon. Gentlemen should object to that.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 440</span>
The hon. Gentleman the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) thought that it was terrible that we should fix our meeting before that of the Select Committee. Why? Surely this Committee is as important as the Select Committee? The hon. Gentleman was only finding something with which to quarrel, since we know that last week he said that he was grateful for the notice given to him and for the manner in which my hon. Friend had conducted the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He expressed gratitude, or at least some hon. Gentlemen opposite expressed gratitude. Well, I know that it is too much to expect hon. Gentlemen opposite to express gratitude for anything. I have never known Tories do that at all.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman started off by being quite amenable to the timetable Motion. Then he felt that that was not living up to his usual form, that he could hardly be his bellicose self if he accepted the Motion in a mild way. Therefore he thought, "I must live up to the image of myself that I am busily engaged in creating, that of the great attacker". Then he dragged in the business of not being able to accept the Motion because it included a reference to next Wednesday afternoon, and the Select Committee might decide to meet on that afternoon. Is the Select Committee more important than this Committee?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to detain the Committee because we want to get on, but the right hon. Gentleman has quite clearly misunderstood what has been said. I will explain the point again so that he knows what he is commenting upon. Last week I certainly accepted the principle of a motion to sit on Wednesday afternoon, but clearly we did not want to clash with the Select Committee. The Motion proposed today is quite different. I accept that the Minister has tried to meet our objection by trying to meet on Thursday afternoon this week. Of course, that is inconvenient, but it is in the spirit of our exchange last week. That is why I do not oppose that proposal. The difficulty arises in terms of Wednesday of next week.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0690">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 441</span>
The right hon. Gentleman asked which was the more important, the Select Committee or this Committee. I would not dare to give an answer. What is of paramount importance is the sensible and reasonable conduct of all the business confronting us, whether in the Select Committee or in this Committee. Five hon. Gentlemen on this side are Members of the Select Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A very long intervention.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will bring it to a close. It would be intolerable if those five hon. Gentlemen were required to be in two important Committees at once, particularly when one may be meeting in London and another in Edinburgh. If the right hon. Gentleman cannot see that, he causes me even greater astonishment than his speeches usually do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is the hon. Gentleman's usual style of arguing. Why should the Select Committee meet at the same time as this Committee if we pass this Motion? It would only happen if the Select Committee were to decide to meet when we in this Committee would be sitting. If there are five Members on the other side of the Committee who are prepared to support that on the Select Committee, they need their heads examined, or else what they are now saying is a lot of nonsense. It is up to the hon. Gentlemen to decide. Are we to understand that it is quite wrong that the Select Committee, with a majority of its Members probably on this Committee, should meet at the same time as this Committee? Who is to blame for that? We are not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is all hypothetical. Surely the right hon. Gentleman must accept that, if the Select Committee is going to fulfil the purpose for which it is established, it must have total freedom of action. If the Government start interfering with the freedom of that Select Committee through Sittings Motions arbitrarily presented in this Committee, it is flying in the face of the principle under which it is alleged that the Select Committee is established.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Once again the hon. Gentleman is talking a lot of nonsense. No
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 442</span>
Committee of the House has complete freedom or is entirely independent of what is taking place elsewhere. This applies whatever Government are in power. Every Committee of the House sits when the House is sitting, and decides when it wants to sit. Members of the Committee decide what they consider to be important business. This is nothing new and has gone on for years. Freedom is always limited by circumstances. I tried to point this out earlier in the discussion, but the hon. Gentleman got carried away by his own verbiage. I do not mind his verbiage, but I hate to see him accepting his own verbiage and believing it. It is rather pitiful.<br><br>
If we decide to meet next Wednesday, it will be up to the Select Committee to decide what it will do. If it decides to meet at the same time as we do, it is no blame to us. We are not responsible for that Committee. Any decision we make in this Committee does not make us responsible if that Committee meets at the same time. The Opposition argument does not hold water. If the Select Committee wants to be entirely free, let it go to Edinburgh or Wick or wherever it may be, and good luck to it. But it is not a good argument to bring up against this Sittings Motion.<br><br>
If the hon. Gentleman was anxious to proceed with this Committee, he should have just thanked my hon. Friend for having decided to meet in the afternoon. Instead of that, we have had this spurious opposition, this cantankerous niggling and gross ingratitude. This is what we get from hon. Gentlemen, and I am amazed, because by and large, they are a decent bunch of fellows. I think they ought to be thoroughly ashamed of themselves.</span></p>
<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is the first time I have ever heard the hon. Member for Craigton (Mr. Millan) described as "circumstances", though I have heard him described in various ways. The right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) said that our freedom was "limited by circumstances". It is limited by the proposals of the hon. Member for Craigton.<br><br>
I am anxious that we should proceed with the Bill as rapidly as possible, particularly as I am anxious to reach Clause
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0691">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 443</span>
19 as soon as possible and have what I now regard to be an urgent discussion on the Government's latest decision to fine local authorities and their officials if they go as far as to refuse to break their existing contracts of employment with teachers in their employ.<br><br>
However, I do not believe that the Motion will assist us in making such progress. My brief experience in this Committee and in others is that, on the whole, Governments do not accelerate progress by introducing Sittings Motions. If anything, they tend to slow it down. I suppose that one acceptable reason for a Sittings Motion is if there can be shown to have been a conscious effort on either side of a Committee discussing a Bill to delay the Bill's progress. This is a legitimate parliamentary tactic. For the protection of minorities in the House of Commons and for the protection of the citizen against the dictatorial conduct of governments, particularly this Government, it is often a vital tactic. Any reasonable man is, however, bound to accept that, if the Opposition are forced to resort to what might be described as filibustering tactics, the Government may be entitled to resort to a Sittings Motion to provide more time to meet the resistance they are encountering. Nobody can suggest that that is the position facing this Committee. Nobody can suggest that there has been filibustering from either side of the Committee.<br><br>
Therefore, we turn inevitably to the only other explanation. It is not a question of the Government's having found that the time they had allocated to the Bill has been unreasonably wasted in the Committee. On the contrary, the explanation is that the Government have not allocated sufficient time for a reasonable and modest discussion of the Bill. They have not allocated sufficient time, as my hon. Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) said, because, as usual, they have got their legislative programme into a mess. This is often the reason why this Government table Sittings Motions. They are incapable of running either the economy or their own legislative programme. This is the only reason for the Motion. There has been no exaggerated or excessive discussion on the Bill. There has been no wasting of time. The simple explanation is that the Gov-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 444</span>
ernment have got their legislative pipeline clogged up, as usual.<br><br>
There is, possibly, one other explanation. I have always detected a strain of the governess in the Under-Secretary's make-up. I cannot help thinking that by the Motion he is giving hon. Members opposite a spanking for their naughtiness in rejecting Clause 3; this is a little retribution to teach them to behave themselves in the future. The Under-Secretary must learn that Parliament has an inalienable right to correct what it regards as inexcusable errors in legislation. It is not for Ministers to respond to a rebuff of this kind by introducing Sittings Motions. That is an unjustifiable response to what I regard as a salutary check on the actions of the Executive.<br><br>
I have one reason over and above those which have already been advanced against the proposal that we sit on Wednesday afternoons. I do not regard this as a very weighty objection. The other objections which have been raised are matters of far greater substance. Nevertheless, this is a point which deserves consideration, because hon. Members on this side will be put to inconvenience. On Wednesday afternoons we hold our regular meetings of Scottish Conservative Members. We make much more progress in that committee than we do here in the presence of hon. Members opposite.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire rightly drew attention to the possible conflict of interest on future Wednesdays between the meetings of this Committee and those of the Select Committee. The right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis), who became rather steamed up, said that it was up to the Select Committee: if this Committee decided to sit on Wednesday afternoons, clearly the Select Committee would have to decide to sit at other times. The right hon. Gentleman overlooks the fact that the Select Committee must enjoy, not only a certain freedom of time, restricted only by the circumstances of the hon. Member for Craigton, but also a certain freedom of place. The right hon. Gentleman talked rather glibly about the Members of the Select Committee going off to Edinburgh or Wick. If Members of the Select Committee do that not only on Wednesday afternoons but on Wednesday mornings, owing to circumstances of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0692">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 445</span>
time and place they will be unable to participate in this Committee's discussions on Wednesday afternoons.<br><br>
It is not the same as the position that might arise on a Sittings Motion in another Standing Committee where another Select Committee was affected, because, by definition, the Select Committee which we are considering in this context is likely to be required to meet a considerable distance from Westminster. Therefore a question of geography as well as a question of time arises.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman misses the point. If we decide to meet on Wednesday afternoon of next week and the Select Committee decides to meet on Wednesday of next week, the fault is that of the Select Committee, if it elects to meet when this Committee is sitting.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is rather like saying that if someone has been caught with his hand in the till it is the fault of the man who left the till accessible. If we approve the Motion, we shall take a decision which will create extra difficulties for the Select Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Brewis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has my hon. Friend noticed that the Motion makes no mention of the length of Sitting? If we meet at 4 o'clock, we might well be sitting till 10 o'clock.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. In such circumstances, not only might the Select Committee be unable to meet on Wednesday, but it might also be unable to meet on Thursday because the proceedings in this Committee had dragged on for so long. The Members of the Select Committee might well find themselves unable to meet in, say, Edinburgh, on Thursday morning, because they had been delayed all night in this Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There would be none of these complications if the Select Committee elected to meet on Monday.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That may well be true, but if the Motion is approved the opportunities of Members of the Select Committee to do their work properly will be substantially curtailed.<br><br>
I turn to other affairs in which Members of this Committee will be prevented
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 446</span>
from playing their rightful part if the Motion is approved. First and foremost, there is the question of the Government's White Paper on Proposals for Earnings-Related Social Security. There is a special reason why we should resist the proposition that we miss our opportunity to take part in that debate on Thursday. This has nothing to do with the merits of the White Paper or of any Bill that follows it. It concerns the nature of the Minister who is introducing it. We have endless experience of the Secretary of State—having introduced the White Paper, he will probably get bored with the subject and turn to something else, to defence or to the care of sick animals. Then, if no Bill is introduced, we shall never have an opportunity to take part in the discussion of a very important proposal. It is highly irresponsible of the Under-Secretary to seek to deny us that opportunity.<br><br>
I believe that we have made acceptable and reasonable progress with the Bill. Under your admirable Chairmanship, Mr. Jennings, at our last Sitting we got. through four Clauses, which is rapid work by any standards. We are probably now passing through phases of the Bill when progress will be more rapid, though we must have an extended discussion on Clause 19. We are making good progress and the effect of approving this Sittings Motion far from accelerating our discussion may actually lead to a slowing down.<br><br>
11.30 a.m.<br><br>
The arrangements made for morning Sittings on Tuesday and Thursday, within a limited space of time on each morning, perhaps concentrates peoples' minds and helps to expedite progress on the Bill; whereas if we are to meet at 4 o'clock and carry on through the watches of the night we shall find that the effect on our health and on our consideration of the Bill will be such, as my hon. Friend the Member for Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) has pointed out, and as hon. Members who have served on Committees in such circumstances will agree, that progress, far from being more rapid, will be very much slower.<br><br>
I would appeal to the Minister, therefore, to think again on this, and to take away this unnecessary and irrelevant Motion. He should go back and do his homework on the legislative programme, recognising that he has mucked it up,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0693">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 447</span>
and then let us get on with our discussion of this Bill in a reasonable and sensible manner on Tuesday and Thursday mornings as has been arranged.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Whatever else one might say about the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis), at least no one would try to liken him to a Trappist monk, but one cannot help questioning whether someone who consumed as much time as he did in Opposition is really seriously interested in making progress. We have seen him popping up and down like a jack-in-the-box almost incessantly this morning.<br><br>
To turn to the reason for this Sittings Motion, it seems to me that it stems not only from the objectionable legislation and measures to which my hon. Friend the Member for Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) referred but, more important, from the failure of the Government to acknowledge the scope there is for decision making at local level. I shall not go into that now, except to say that we have here two perfect examples, one referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro), and also the question of fee-paying schools. There are two points which have taken a great deal of time in this Committee. I hope the Government will now recognise that they must look very urgently at devolutionary means of clearing the choked machinery of Parliament. They are trying to force through a great deal, and although I am more enthusiastic than almost any one about getting cracking with the Town and Country Planning Bill and the Housing Bill, because I believe them both to be useful and important Measures, I would urge the Minister to drop this high-handed action of his in presenting a Sittings Motion which really denies him the co-operation which I am sure he would be getting; as we have seen, we have been nipping along pretty swiftly once we passed the really contentious part of the Bill.<br><br>
With regard to sitting on Thursday afternoon, if the Government are to get their quorum in this Committee to discuss the interests of the young, it will only be at the expense of the elderly who are to be debated downstairs. I do not believe that the Government can expect hon. Members to do their duty to both categories at the same time, and I would,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 448</span>
therefore, urge the Minister to drop this Motion which has already taken 65 minutes during which we could have made substantial progress with the Bill itself.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The allegation that I am in any way trying to prevent proper consideration of this Bill is falsified not only by what has actually happened but also by the Motion itself. I said, in moving it, that I was not complaining about important matters being discussed at length, but was giving rather more opportunity for that to be done by moving a Sittings Motion so that all who are interested will have three opportunities, instead of only two, to make interesting speeches on the Bill.<br><br>
I have already, in my intervention, dealt with the question of the Estimates days; and I made clear that the Government would wish to see Estimates and matters Days available. We are, therefore, interested to see how the rest of the business for the Scottish Committees could be expedited, as far as we can reasonably do so whilst still allowing full discussion of matters coming before them.<br><br>
The third point was on the Select Committee. It seemed to me that my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) answered that adequately and fairly. It was represented to me that it would be rather unfair to the Select Committee for us to meet on Wednesday of this week because it had previously decided to have a meeting on that day. In those circumstances, I moved our meeting from Wednesday of this week to Thursday of this week. We know that, for various reasons, Thursday afternoon is not such a convenient time for Members to meet as Wednesday afternoon, but the Select Committee has not arranged any subsequent meetings, and it is perfectly free to arrange meetings on different days from Wednesday of next week; and just as it would not be right for the Minister in charge of the Bill in this Committee to ignore what a Select Committee has previously decided, so it seems to me that it is fair for the Select Committee, when it meets tomorrow, to take account of any decision we may make today. I see no difficulty in doing so because no fewer than nine Members of the Select Committee—indeed a majority of them—are also members of this Committee here, and they will have a full opportunity to put to their colleagues
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0694">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 449</span>
tomorrow the necessity not to interfere with the Education Bill.<br><br>
Regardless of what I might move, the Select Committee could easily meet tomorrow and decide to meet on Tuesday, Thursday, or any other day, which could well clash with something we have decided. We might decide today to move a Motion that we meet on Tuesday or Thursday of next week and the Select Committee could decide tomorrow to meet on the same day. There is no way of avoiding a clash except by the simple circumstance that the Select Committee can take account of any decision we have made, which is what I would expect it to do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is saying the Select Committee—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. The hon. Gentleman has spoken twice. I have yet to be called.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Shocking.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know it is shocking.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is a criticism of the Chair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Oh, no. It is not a reflection on the Chair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would remind the hon. Member that it is only the second time he has attempted to rise this morning and there is no guarantee that he is not going to be called. On this intervention the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Bruce-Gardyne) caught my eye first. I again call Mr. Bruce-Gardyne.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was only going to point out that the Minister says the Select Committee has only to take account of decisions we make, but that there is another quite simple way out, to which he has not devoted himself; that is, for him to withdraw his Sittings Motion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That does not add much to our discussion of this Motion.<br><br>
I believe I have answered the point relating to the Select Committee and generally have met the wishes of hon. Members so far as this week is concerned by suggesting that we meet on Thursday. I
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 450</span>
feel that I have been reasonable so far as next week and subsequent weeks, if any, are concerned by suggesting that we meet on Wednesday and I hope we can now come quickly to a decision on this Motion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am rising not to intervene at all—[HON. MEMBERS: "Oh?"]—on the arguments in dealing with this matter but to make a personal explanation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is this debatable or is it a personal statement?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is this. I engaged as a Member of this Committee to come here on Tuesday and Thursday, at a certain hour on both days. I have many other obligations within the precincts of the House, also outside London. Speaking for myself, it is a question of whether or not I accept an obligation which will interfere with my other legitimate Parliamentary obligations. In regard to that decision I would make a suggestion. There is a strong believe in the Scottish Committee that Parliament only meets three days a week. I wish to remind this Committee that Parliament meets on five days a week and that we do not come here on a Tuesday morning so as to get away as quickly and as early as we can on a Thursday afternoon. I would ask my hon. Friend, therefore, what is wrong with Monday morning? [<i>Interruption.</i>] We also have the whole of Friday. What is wrong with meeting on Friday? I would like an answer to that from my hon. Friend. We know that Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday are days which are crammed with business, on the Floor of the House, and in Committees, and, as I have indicated, in many other places. If we are now going to invade arrangements to which some of us were already committed when we accepted nomination for this Committee, then we are creating a problem. If no attention is to be paid to my suggestion of meeting on Monday or Friday morning or on days other than Tuesday and Thursday, then I will personally not commit myself to attend this Committee.<br><br></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stodart</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>——</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Hannan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. Is it in order, on a Sittings Motion, for an hon. Member to intervene more than once?</span></p>

<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are still in Standing Committee, and there is no restriction on the number of times an hon. Member may speak. I hope this one will be brief.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stodart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a slightly unusual Sittings Motion, because my experience of them is that Governments usually move them in the believe that Oppositions have been trying to waste the Government's time, and because a Bill will be held up. Nobody has suggested that today. Therefore, will the Minister tell us how many Sittings he expected this Bill would take? Have things gone completely wrong—because Sittings Motions imply a slight degree of emergency action? If he expected to have this Bill by now, it must be that those who advised him advised him quite wrongly on the length of time it would take. If that is the case, then the Government have been guilty of not being clued up on the feeling that might exist on both sides of the Committee, and they should not, therefore, try to overload the Committee with more legislation than it can cope with.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First of all, I hope that before we conclude this debate the Minister will do us the courtesy of replying to the points made, and replying to the suggestions made by his hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin). There have been various alternative proposals put to the Minister about different times. The most specific one was argued with his usual cogency and fluency by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan, and I should have thought the Committee and the hon. Gentleman were entitled to hear a reply from the Minister.<br><br>
Secondly, I should have thought the Committee might be interested to hear the views of the Liberal Party on this Sittings Motion. Do they agree with the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan? Do they have a different proposition? Are they in favour of the Sittings Motion as it stands? We are entitled to know where they stand.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alasdair Mackenzie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I regret that I was not here at the beginning and did not hear the greater part of the debate. Therefore, in all fairness, I am not really in a position to put forward my view.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 452</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Mr. Maclennan) should not feel too unhappy about not being here at the beginning. The hon. Gentleman is often not here at all.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Maclennan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I correct the record on that point? I have been present in the Committee from the beginning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am terribly sorry. I meant the hon. Member for Ross and Cromarty (Mr. Alasdair Mackenzie) should not be too unhappy, because the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Bruce-Gardyne) has hardly been in the Committee since the beginning. He has popped in and out like a jack-in-the-box.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</span><span class='membercontribution'>: All I can say is that the hon. Gentleman has not been bothering to use his eyes. It seems to me that that was a completely irrelevant intervention, in any case. All I can say to the hon. Member for Ross and Cromarty (Mr. Alasdair Mackenzie) is that I should have thought, as we have a proposition before the Committee, that it would be useful to have the benefit of the Liberal Party's views. It is very difficult to avoid the conclusion, if we do not have the benefit of the hon. Member's intervention, that the Liberal Party does not have any views on this either way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. What the hon. Member has said is very skilful but it is repetitious. There were five succeeding sentences in which the same thing was said in five different ways.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. I am going to ask for your advice, Mr. Jennings. We are now witnessing an attempt to coerce, mentally, a respected Member of this Committee, one who has given the Committee a good deal of useful service. But now a type of coercion of the lowest form is being applied to him, and I suggest that there should be a Ruling on this because it can be extended. That is the danger of the process which the hon. Member is now seeking to start.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I were to see the hon. Member for Ross and Cromarty (Mr. Alasdair Mackenzie) in any danger, either mental or physical, I would immediately intervene.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is worse than physical.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We will proceed. I am quite sure that the hon. Member for Ross and Cromarty is well able to take care of himself, and, if he needed my protection. I am quite sure I would leap to it immediately.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will study my remarks with care tomorrow. I certainly was not aware of the fact that there had been any repetition involved at all. But, at any rate, I have made the point I wanted to make. I still feel that, while the Minister may have provided a reply of sorts—and I am sure it was not a reply which impressed either my hon. Friends or some of the Minister's hon. Friends—to the representations which were made to him against the terms and the timings of the Sittings Motion, he has totally failed to answer the representations made against having a Sittings Motion this morning at all. That is a point on which we are still entitled to a reply. So I hope that before we conclude this debate he will give an answer on the substance of the matter, and also answer his hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Govan.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought the Minister was going to rise to answer the very important point made by his hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin). The hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan has been an assiduous attender right through the Committee's debates and has made a number of very important contributions. It is a matter for great regret that one effect of this Motion, if it is carried, will be to deny us the wisdom of the hon. Gentleman at any time other than Tuesday and Thursday mornings. I am very sorry indeed that the Minister has not seen fit to reply to the very important points made by his hon. Friend.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan called our attention to something else which shocks me. That is the way his hon. Friends come down on Tuesday mornings, and go away from this place as quickly as they can on Thursdays. That explains a lot to me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was not referring to them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have often wondered why on Mondays there are so few Labour
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 454</span>
Members present. I am very sorry that this decision will deny us the possibility of meeting on a Monday, which might suit some of us very well indeed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The speech of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin), contained the warning that, if this Sittings Motion is proceeded with, he may not be able to be here. It is a matter which concerns not only the Members of the Committee, but also the Minister because it could well affect the course of the proceedings.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is the point I was trying to make. The hon. Gentleman made it quite clear that he would not be able to attend, because of his other duties. He would be able to attend on a Monday, when he would be able to break away from the mirror at which he said he looks. I am not surprised at what he said, because if I were the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan I, too, would look in the mirror as often as I could. But I know that when the hon. Gentleman looks in the mirror on Monday mornings he sees my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor). That is what I think he was telling us. But, after the hon. Gentleman's observations, I should have thought there would have been some reply from the Minister.<br><br>
I am very disappointed that the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) should have revealed himself as he did this morning. I remember that when we discussed Sittings Motions when we were in Government—it happened very rarely, and they were always reasonable and well timed—the right hon. Gentleman used to get carried away. He would sit through the Committee stage of every Bill, nursing his wrath and keeping it warm from day to day. We heard him so often, and our eardrums still ring from those days. Then, four or five years ago, he became a very different person, very agreeable and helpful to us all, and we thought the right hon. Gentleman had found himself. Yet today he emerged in his old form—carping, contentious, cantakerous—<br><br>
I am sorry that he felt I had been so unreasonable during the passage of this Bill. I am very hurt that he should feel this. I have tried to be very helpful and agreeable. I have tried with my hon.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0697">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 455</span>
Friends to improve the Bill, and we have succeeded to some extent in doing that. I remember one of the last Bills which we considered in this Committee, the Social Work (Scotland) Bill. Our work in Committee came to an end after 12 Sittings, and I recall very well how one hon. Gentleman opposite rose to his feet and congratulated my hon. Friends and myself on the reasonable and constructive way in which we approached Bills in the Scottish Committee. Our attitude throughout has been constructive and helpful to the Government, as to the people of Scotland and the children who, in a sense, are in our care here.<br><br>
The Minister has made no reply at all. I indicated earlier that I thought it might be reasonable to agree to the Thursday afternoon sitting this week. I accept, of course, that this is very inconvenient to many hon. Members. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart wishes to take part on Thursday afternoon and I should like to be present myself. But I feel bound by the indication I gave at our last Sitting, that we would not oppose a Sittings Motion for Wednesday afternoon of this week, provided that it did not clash with the Select Committee. Then, when the hon. Gentleman discovered that there would be a clash, he rearranged the Sittings Motion so that we would meet on Thursday afternoon of this week. In the circumstances, it would be reasonable, however reluctantly, to agree to that part of the Sittings Motion.<br><br>
What we cannot agree to is the demand to sit on Wednesday afternoon of next week. I urge the Minister to withdraw that part of his Sittings Motion and leave the matter open for the moment. Let us wait to see what the Select Committee decides to do when it meets tomorrow. In the light of that decision, I am certain it will be possible rapidly to reach some simple compromise on a new Sittings Motion at another meeting of this Committee. That is surely a helpful and constructive suggestion.<br><br>
If the hon. Gentleman refuses to accept it, then he will demonstrate to all of us that he is not the reasonable person he pretends to be, but is assuming the guise of the jackbooted Juggernaut trampling over the will of this Committee in order to force through contentious and, in some respects, objectionable legislation. The fact of the matter is that the Government
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 456</span>
have got themselves into a terrible muddle. They are relying on the Opposition to get them out of it, and I see no reason why we should.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stodart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to protest with very great vigour at what I believe is the studied discourtesy of the Minister on this matter. If he would have the courtesy to answer the points put to him it would facilitate his task a great deal. He started this downward path on Second Reading when, in his winding up speech, he totally ignored many of the points which had been put to him. He followed that up on Clause 1 by completely ignoring many perfectly practical points which were put. Is he really not going to answer the debate this morning by replying to some of the points that have been made? Because he cannot disagree with me when I say that if, four or five years ago, I or my hon. Friends had been in his position he would have had no cause for complaint.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have already given the reasons why I moved this Motion. Secondly, I have replied to the points that were raised, particularly the point about the Select Committee, and I have replied very adequately indeed. I have no intention of being drawn to my feet every time any hon. Gentleman opposite raises another repetitious point. If the hon. Gentleman thinks I am going to conduct the Committee's business in that way, then he is going to be very sorely disappointed.<br><br>
I have noted what my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) has said about meeting on Mondays or Fridays. The present Sittings Motion does not deal with Mondays and Fridays, but I note——</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Take it away.</span></p>
<p>12 noon.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman might allow me to finish. He has been complaining that I have not been answering the points, and now that I am doing so he is determined to be his usual objectionable self in interjecting while I am doing so.<br><br>
I have noted that my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Govan is enthusiastic about meetings on Mondays and Fridays, and that seems to be a point of view which finds a good deal
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0698">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 457</span>
of acceptance on the other side of the Committee. Having accepted the Motion, if we find that we are still not making sufficient progress, I will consider seriously whether we should meet on all five days of the week and bring in a Sittings Motion accordingly.</span></p>

Clause 8</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
TRANSFER SCHEMES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maclennan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This Clause is one of the most important Clauses which we have to consider, in that it seeks to enlarge the scope of the local education authority and, if the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum is a correct description of that Clause, to enable the authority to submit less detailed transfer schemes than at present to the scrutiny of the Secretary of State. In so far as this is so, the Clause deserves the most careful scrutiny.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 458</span>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. M. S. Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose in his place and claimed to move,</i> That the Question be now put.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put,</i> That the Question be now put:—</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 14, Noes 9.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The only time when a newspaper can be perused is when it is relevant to a speech that is being made; otherwise it is quite out of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How can it be relevant to a vote?</span></p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 14, Noes 9.</p>
<p>The original Section 30 in the principal Act for which Clause 8 will be substituted deals principally with the transfer of pupils from primary to secondary education but, as I understand from the terms of Clause 8, the transfer schemes which are covered will not deal only with transfer from primary to secondary education but also with schemes of transfer from junior high schools to senior high schools, from four-year schools to six-year schools. This extension of the power of the local education authority I cannot allow to go past without question in view of the considerable public interest which has been expressed in the problem of transfer within my constituency.</p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0699">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 459</span>
<p>The reorganisation of education along comprehensive lines which has been carried out by many local authorities in Scotland, following the issuance by the Secretary of State of Circular 600, led to the advancement of a number of educational schemes of transfer under Section 30 of the principal Act which we are now proposing to amend.</p>
<p>Under the terms of that Section a duty was imposed upon the local authority of submitting these schemes to the Secretary of State for his approval, but approval of the scheme advanced by the education authority in the County of Sutherland was granted apparently on the grounds that the Secretary of State could find no educational reasons to interfere with the suggested scheme. In other words, he found the proposal to downgrade Dornoch Academy and to upgrade certain other schools educationally acceptable. Will the Minister make clear in what circumstances under this clause the Secretary of State would consider that it would not be open to him to approve the scheme, and in what circumstances he would intervene?</p>
<p>A transfer scheme, as it is described, may have far-reaching consequences, leading to considerable heart-searching by the parents of the pupils involved. We all know of the inequities of the 11-plus selection system and how parents have felt their children to be under great pressure as a result of it. One of the major purposes of the comprehensive system is to eliminate this undesirable pressure. What is happening in certain parts of Scotland, if I understand aright the communications I have received from the Secretary of State on this subject, is that in many rural districts there are junior high schools where transfer schemes to senior high schools, six-year schools, operate, and selection occurs at the end of S2. This selection process may give rise to the greatest concern by parents of the children involved. In such a situation the approval of the Secretary of State is a vital need.</p>
<p>Will the Minister give an assurance that that approval will not be given without the most careful scrutiny of the objection of the parents concerned? This situation is likely to increase as the number of junior schools throughout the rural district increases. I seek from my hon. Friend an indication of how and in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 460</span>
what circumstances the Secretary of State might refuse to give his approval.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brewis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not following the hon. Gentleman very well, but, since I know that his constituency is a very scattered rural area, is he saying that children are being transferred a long way away at the S2 stage against the wishes of their parents?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maclennan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I am not saying that. I am saying that there are many schools in existence and planned within the area of that education authority which are four-year high schools, and this will lead to the transference of academic pupils at the end of S2 to the one six-year school in the area of the education authority.<br><br>
It is the process of selection at the end of S2 which gives rise to the sense of frustration in the minds of some parents. I think my hon. Friend is in agreement with me that the four-year high school is by no means as educationally desirable as the six-year high school. This fact and the difficulties which exist in rural areas make it all the more important that the Secretary of State should scrutinise carefully any scheme of transfer which involves the pupils being moved or not moved at the end of S2 or S4 to a six-year school.<br><br>
I always welcome a Measure which seeks to strengthen the powers of local authorities, particularly in matters concerning the administration of the educational system. This Measure is of this type, in that it strengthens the free choice of the local education authority with regard to the scheme of transfer. But, in view of the experience in my constituency of the controversy arising out of the Dornoch Academy downgrading, a controversy which is still very much alive and which may be the precursor of further controversies when other four-year schools are created in my constituency, I am not altogether happy about the transfer scheme.<br><br>
I would be most grateful if my hon. Friend will answer the question I put to him as to the circumstances in which the Secretary of State would either approve or disapprove of a transfer scheme under this Clause.</span></p>
<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has raised two different but connected points. First,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0700">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 461</span>
secondary reorganisation as such; on which he will know that the view that has been taken by the Government is that, wherever possible, it is preferable to have a system of all-through six-year schools. However, it is the case that in certain areas of Scotland there are practical reasons why it is difficult to have a system of six-year schools. In one or two areas we have a system which is either operating at the moment, or is due to operate under the reorganisation proposals, of junior high schools and senior high schools, with the junior high schools being four-year schools comprehensive for the first two years, and at the end of S2 and additionally at the end of S4, pupils are transferred to the six-year schools, the senior high schools.<br><br>
There are other complications. Sometimes these senior high schools are four-year schools starting from S3. In other cases they are schools starting from S1 nd are comprehensive for a particular area at S1 as well as being comprehensive, or partly comprehensive, for a larger area at the beginning of S3. My hon. Friend, in the circumstances in Sutherland, will understand the point I am making.<br><br>
The Clause enables the Secretary of State to ask for transfer schemes which can cover not just transfer at the age of 12—the age of transfer from primary to secondary education is expressed in Section 30 of the 1962 Act—but it would enable us to ask also the authorities to include in their transfer schemes the arrangements under which they intend to have the transfers from junior high schools to senior high schools at the end of S2 or at the end of S4.<br><br>
I am sure my hon. Friend will agree with what we are doing in this Clause. It will enable us in a situation like Sutherland, where the kind of system I have described is likely to operate, to cover this particular point in the transfer schemes as well. The existing transfer scheme does not cover this point because it is done under Section 30, but that scheme, which has been revised in the light of Circular 614, has not yet been approved by the Secretary of State. There are one or two points outstanding. I cannot deal with them this morning in this Commitee, even if it were proper for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 462</span>
me to do so, but I can say that the scheme is not approved under the present arrangements.<br><br>
We have taken into account the point about parental choice at the end of S2 in approving schemes for all areas of the country where senior and junior high school systems axe operating, and we have it very much in mind in regard to the Sutherland situation. My hon. Friend knows the particular problems in Sutherland because of the scattered and sparse population to be catered for by the establishment of four-year schools.<br><br>
In the establishment of four-year schools, it is necessary that such schools should be viable; in other words, that they will not lose every pupil at the end of S2 so as to make them non-viable from the aspect of S3 and S4. Therefore, there are difficult considerations in regard to Sutherland.<br><br>
We have very much in mind the question of maintaining the largest element of parental choice in deciding transfers from junior high schools to senior high schools. In any case, the Clause gives us power to adopt these considerations in the transfer scheme, and the Clause is an improvement on the present situation.</span></p>

<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
POWER OF SECRETARY OF STATE TO REQUIRE EDUCATION AUTHORITY TO FIX A SINGLE SCHOOL COMMENCEMENT OR LEAVING DATE.</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I call Amendment No. 53, with which it would be convenient to take Amendment No. 54, in page 8, line 30, leave out 'single'.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That would be convenient.<br><br>
I beg to move Amendment 53, in page 8, line 29, leave out 'single'.<br><br>
In the Second Reading debate the Secretary of State made clear that this Clause, by amending Section 33 of the principal Act, provides that there will be only two leaving dates for all authorities in Scotland. He went on to say that this had been discussed with all the local education authorities, that the proposal was
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0701">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 463</span>
acceptable to them, and that it was not expected to cause any difficulties.<br><br>
The Clause also allows for local education authorities to have a single leaving date. This would be a great change if it were to take effect. The Secretary of State made it clear in his speech that no local education authority, so far as he was aware, had any intention to introduce a single leaving date, but that in order to leave the field for experiment as wide as possible for the future he thought it right to provide enough powers in this Clause for the Secretary of State to direct that there could be a single leaving date at some time in the future.<br><br>
I am the last person to suggest that there should not be room for experiment in education. At the same time I wonder if there is any necessity for this proposal at all. There have been some objections to the principle that a single leaving date should be introduced. Among these I know that Banffshire has serious concern which it has expressed. Indeed, my hon. Friend the Member for Banff (Mr. W. H. K. Baker) has put his name to this Amendment.<br><br>
The purpose of this Amendment is to discover the Government's intentions and why they think it desirable to introduce such a provision. There are certain clear objections to the introduction of a single leaving date, not the least of which is the fact that, because children's birthdays fall on different days throughout the year, the introduction of one time of the year for departure from school could mean that children would be staying on very nearly a year later than the statutory age. One local authority has pointed out that when the school leaving age is raised the introduction of a single leaving date would possibly mean that many children would be staying on to the age of 17. I hope the hon. Gentleman will give us more explanation than we have received so far before we can allow this Clause to go through unchallenged.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would this be the convenient moment to have a general discussion on the single leaving age, Mr. Jennings, or would you prefer it on the Question, That the Clause stand part of the Bill?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be in order on the Question, That the Clause stand
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 464</span>
part of the Bill, and not in order on the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made clear that this is primarily a probing Amendment, and I am glad to give the information for which he asked. It was made clear by my right hon. Friend on Second Reading, and I also made it clear in answer to a Parliamentary Question the other day, that it is certainly not the intention of the Government to require any authority to introduce a single leaving date. It is certainly not our intention before the school leaving age is raised and we do not envisage circumstances in which it would be our intention in the years after the raising of the school leaving age, so far ahead as we can at present see.<br><br>
There are good educational arguments for a single leaving date, which have been canvassed rather more extensively in England than they have in Scotland, in the sense that it would allow every pupil to finish his education at the end of a complete school year. A school year ought to be coherently organised, and it is disorganising for a school to have its pupils leaving at different times during the year; so that there are educational advantages.<br><br>
On the other hand, there is the temporary disadvantage that, when the school leaving age is raised, to have a single leaving date would mean that some pupils would have to be at school till 16 years and 11 months, even though they might not wish to stay on as long as that. It is too great a jump to go from the present situation, with the normal pattern of two leaving dates, and three leaving dates in some areas, and a school leaving age of 15, to a school leaving age of 16 and a single leaving date. This is not practical in the Scottish situation and would cause considerable resentment if one were to attempt this on a wholesale scale in Scotland.<br><br>
Nevertheless, because there are educational advantages in the single leaving date it seems to be desirable that in preparing new legislation one at least should allow opportunity for an education authority, in the light of circumstances in its area, to apply to the Secretary of State for a single leaving date. It cannot do so under the Clause as at present drafted, without applying to the Secretary of State.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 465</span>
One has to look tar ahead, and we anticipate the necessity for flexibility in legislation. There may be circumstances in which the Secretary of State might wish to require either education authorities as a whole or a particular education authority to move to a single leaving date. There is no question of this at the moment, and one does not wish it to be done for some time after the raising of the school leaving age, but circumstances may change, and we are putting legislation in a form which will enable that to happen a number of years ahead. It is unlikely that a Secretary of State would ever be in a position to force unwilling authorities to have a single leaving date. If it became a real question, then the whole matter could be looked at again.<br><br>
There are no education authorities who feel aggrieved at the drafting of the Clause from this point of view. They would feel aggrieved if they thought that the Secretary of State were going to foist upon them a single leaving date. There are two education authorities which have been unhappy about moving from three moving dates to two. There are ten authorities in that situation at the moment, two of which have complained, including Banffshire. In view of the educational reasons I have given, three leaving dates would be too much, and we should move over to two leaving dates as soon as we can. These are likely to be the traditional dates of Christmas and Summer.<br><br>
I have gone a little wide, for which I apologise, but I have tried to give the Committee the Government's thinking on this matter. I hope it will be accepted as a flexible method of dealing with legislation. It contains nothing sinister, and no authority need feel apprehensive.</span></p>
<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brewis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Amendment affects also a single date for commencing. The Minister did not mention that. I recognise that there are possible reasons for having one leaving date, but I do not think that they are nearly so strong for a single starting date. With a single starting date a child could start school nearly a year late, which could give rise to considerable difficulties for parents. In view of what is done in the first year
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 466</span>
at primary school, it will not be a great interruption of a course if there is more than one starting date at the primary stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that I did not mention that matter. I do not recollect the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) mentioning it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I meant to but did not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Galloway (Mr. Brewis) for raising it, because it enables me to say something about it.<br><br>
The normal circumstance now is that it is not possible to have a single commencing date; the law does not allow it. The Act talks about two or more fixed dates for commencing school attendance.<br><br>
There are one or two authorities which, in particular parts of their areas, have virtually a single commencing date. They do this by laying down two commencing dates, normally at summer and at the beginning of February, but saying that any child who reaches 5 before the February in which he would otherwise go to school can, if his parents wish, be taken into school the previous August. In other words, these autthorities move the date forward and take an age group of from about 4½ to 5½ That is a complete year's age group, and it does not involve parents in having their children left at home until they are 5 years 11 months old. Therefore, no parent who wants his child to go to school feels at a disadvantage. On the whole, his child is taken into school earlier than he would be under a two-date system? That must be done at the moment by these authorities fixing two dates and expecting and hoping that every parent who would be eligible to send his child for the second date will send him on the first date. Normally, parents co-perate on this basis.<br><br>
There are only one or two small areas in Scotland where this applies, but it is done now. It seems reasonable to allow a single commencing date on the application of an authority which wants to make an arrangement of this sort without having the rather artificial arrangement of fixing two dates and then not using the second one. The Clause allows that to be done.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0703">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 467</span>
I have very much in mind tre interests of parents. We know of only one case in which an authority has tried to establish one commencing date despite the provisions of the principal Act. That was last year in the case of Glasgow. The Secretary of State did not give his permission for that, because he did not think that children were being admitted early enough and the authority was told that it must revert to two commencing dates. In most circumstances it is reasonable to have two commencing dates, but the question of flexibility must be considered. An authority which wants one commencing date must be allowed to have it if it can advance a reasonable case for so doing and if the Secretary of State thinks that all the interests of parents and of children are taken into account.<br><br>
Again looking further ahead, there is a case for one school commencing date, as there is for one leaving date, in the sense that we are now moving to a situation where virtually everywhere in Scotland there is only one transfer date from primary to secondary education. As opposed to previously when there were two transfer dates, only five authorities now have more than one transfer date to secondary education. We have already provided in Clause 8 for a single transfer date, unless the Secretary of State gives authority to continue with two. We are moving now by the Bill to a single transfer date. From the point of view of school organisation, there is something to be said in those circumstances for a single commencing date.<br><br>
I do not believe that the argument for a single commencing date is nearly as strong, educationally speaking, as the argument for a single leaving date. We do not intend here to coerce local authorities into introducing a single date if they do not wish to do so. We are, again, simply providing a flexibility on the commencing dates which, as I have explained, we consider desirable also for leaving dates. I hope that this answer satisfies the hon. Member for Galloway.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Galloway (Mr. Brewis) for raising the question of the commencing date. As I said, I had intended to do this but forgot.<br><br>
I am interested in what the Under-Secretary told us about the position as
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 468</span>
to the commencing date. My concern has been that, even with more than a single commencing date, there are occasions where the age of entry of a child to a primary school can vary enormously. This is a matter of some concern within a family group—I have experienced this in my family—where children can start primary school at widely differing ages. This can be something of a family strain. I am glad to know that the single commencing date which the Under-Secretary has in mind, if ever it becomes general, would probably be in the nature of what I can describe as a block entry, so that my fear that a limitation of date could lead to the exclusion of some children would not arise. I am satisfied with the Under-Secretary's answer on that question.<br><br>
In reply to both Amendments the Under-Secretary stressed that it is not his intention to coerce local authorities or force them to do things against their will. I am certain that that is the hon. Gentleman's intention in respect of this Clause, but his attitude on Clause 1 gave us no real assurance that the expression of will by local authorities would be respected by him. Clause 1 completely tramples on any expression of will in education by any local authority.<br><br>
However, in the context of the Clause the hon. Gentleman has given a reasonable answer and one which is certainly acceptable to me. I believe that there is educational advantage in limiting the number of leaving dates. I believe that two dates make more sense than three. In purely educational terms one date might make more sense than two. On the other hand, there are consequential problems in terms of the age at which some children would leave school. I am very glad that the Minister is not proposing to force a single date on local authorities in the near future.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary is, perhaps, under the impression that there has been no objection to the single date proposal. According to a newspaper report which I have here, Banffshire was to make representations to the Secretary of State about what it described as the proposal to introduce a single date. The hon. Gentleman has made it clear that, although this is a proposal in the Bill, it is not a proposal for action in the Secretary of State's mind, at least certainly
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0704">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 469</span>
not now or in the near future. I agree that it is probably right to include a provision of this kind which could perhaps be implemented one day in the future should circumstances justify it. On the assurance that the Government's intention is no greater than that, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Just before the hon. Gentleman withdraws the Amendment—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is impossible, now that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) has spoken, for me to ask whether it is the pleasure of the Committee that the Amendment be withdrawn.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank you for allowing me this single intervention, Mr. Jennings. If I have not misinterpreted the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur), I think that he has rather enlarged the condition that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary attached to the leaving age and the starting date. The hon. Gentleman used the phrases "not now" and "nor in the near future". I did not gather from what my hon. Friend said that he had used a phrase such as "nor in the near future". As used by the hon. Gentleman, that phrase goes a little beyond what my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary said. I take it that this is an intention. I go further and say that it is a decision. I agree that its point of application must be reserved. I do not think that it should be defined as the hon. Gentleman sought to define it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can clear this up. It is certainly not a decision or an intention. What I tried to make clear was that it enabled this Secretary of State or any subsequent Secretary of State to take a decision later, whereas if it was not in the Bill it would be completely impossible. That is all I said. I certainly did not say that there had been any decision taken about this.<br><br>
In a Written Answer on 22nd November my right hon. Friend said specifically:
<br><blockquote><p>"… I have concluded that I would not be justified in proposing the adoption in the near future of a single date."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 22nd November, 1968; Vol. 773, c. 345.]</p></blockquote>
That is the position.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 470</span>
I personally do not see that after the raising of the age it would be desirable or practicable to have a single leaving date introduced, at least till the process of settling down after the raising of the age has taken place. It can be looked at again then, but that takes us a number of years away from 1969.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the Minister for his reply. It was important that he should intervene. I thought that the position was as he has just described it. The position is in fact as I assumed it to be when I sought leave to withdraw the Amendment.<br><br>
May I say for the benefit of anybody outside who reads these debates that it it is not my wish to press the Amendment, but, because the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) intervened, quite properly—I would have given way to him if I had realised he wished to intervene—a procedural problem faces us, namely, that I am not now able to withdraw the Amendment. I shall, therefore, take the next best course and allow it to be negatived.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 51, in page 8, line 36, after 'under' insert 'paragraph (<i>a</i>) or'.<br><br>
This is basically a drafting Amendment. The need to have different dates for different schools in an education authority area arises simply from the different incidence in many cases of holidays between Roman Catholic and non-denominational schools. From the way the Clause is drafted, particularly paragraph (<i>ii</i>) of the proviso, it would be possible to fix different dates for leaving dates but not different dates for commencing dates. Obviously we want to cover the two sets of circumstances. I am not sure how many authorities now have different dates for school attendance depending on holidays. We must obviously provide for differences that there may be between Roman Catholic and non-denominational schools. The Clause as drafted is not good enough, and the Amendment puts it right.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0705">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 471</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think it right to say that the advantages of a single school leaving age are formidable. From personal experience I would say that it is not only a matter of those who are leaving. I am also concerned in this context with those who do not leave. As any one who has actually taught in a junior secondary school for five years or more will know, with three leaving dates, once the first batch has left, however ingenious one may be, it is very difficult to hold the interest of those who remain. There is among them a feeling that their further education cannot be all that important, and, with the best will in the world, one cannot blame them. I would hope, therefore, that in any discussions that are to take place my right hon. Friends will urge that the single school leaving age is as important, if not more important, than raising the school leaving age, and for these educational reasons.<br><br>
It is fair to say, also, in this context, that there are mighty advantages from the point of view of the Treasury, because the extra cost of a single school-leaving age is marginal compared with the cost of comparable legislation which might be brought in; but to discuss that would be going too wide of this Amendment.<br><br>
I refer, as did the Minister, to a reply given by the Secretary of State for Scotland on this subject. I had asked him, in a Parliamentary Question,
<br><blockquote><p>"(1) What consideration he is giving to a single school-leaving date in 1969;</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(2) What consideration he is giving to a single school-leaving date after the raising of the school-leaving age in 1972–73."</p></blockquote>
The reply of the Secretary of State for Scotland, to which my hon. Friend referred, was:
<br><blockquote><p>"In the light of views expressed by education authorities I have concluded that I would not be justified in proposing the adoption in the near future of a single date. It is too soon to consider what should be done after the raising of the school leaving age in 1972–73. The Education (Scotland) Act 1962 does not provide for the fixing of a single leaving date and I am considering this aspect in connection with the forthcoming Education Bill."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 22nd November, 1968; Vol. 773, c. <i>345</i>.]</p></blockquote>
In my view it is not too soon to consider what should be done after the raising
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 472</span>
of the school leaving age in 1972-73. Decisions will have to be taken fairly soon. In this connection I would like to bring to the attention of the Committee a further Question. I asked the Secretary of State for Scotland on the same day:
<br><blockquote><p>"What estimate he has made of the number of additional pupils in Scottish schools, if a single school-leaving date is in operation when the school-leaving age is raised in 1972–73."</p></blockquote>
The Secretary of State for Scotland replied:
<br><blockquote><p>"Any estimate would depend on an assumption about the pattern of leaving dates which was being superseded. If it were the present pattern, there would be, at January, 1973, an additional 15,000 pupiis attributable to the combined effect of raising the leaving age and introducing a single leaving date, of whom 5.000 would be attributable to the latter factor only. At January, 1974, the corresponding figures would be 40,000 and 8,000."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 22nd November, 1968; Vol. 773, c. 346.]</p></blockquote>
I would not query these figures; I am sure they are accurate; but they reveal an order of magnitude which really necessitates early decision making if there is to be the kind of change which hon. Members like myself may want.<br><br>
As I understood, the main objection to the single school leaving age came not from my hon. Friend's Department but from the then Ministry of Labour, now the Ministry of Employment and Productivity. In discussions on this, bearing in mind, as the Minister has himself said, that the educational reasons are formidable, I feel there ought now to be thorough discussions with the C.B.I., the T.U.C. and the Scottish T.U.C. about the viability of a single school-leaving date.<br><br>
Five or six years ago I would have had to confess that because of the youth employment situation in Scotland it was not very realistic to argue in terms of a single school-leaving date. That might still have been the position two or three years ago, but thanks to a number of factors the employment position for the school leaver is now very much better. Some figures which were given to me the other day by my hon. Friend the Member for Jarrow (Mr. Fernyhough) showed that with 2,500 youngsters in Scotland wanting jobs there were 5,500 vacancies. That may not apply, of course, in all areas. It is not always possible to match the vacancies to those seeking them, but
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0706">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 473</span>
generally it is true to say that the youth employment situation in Scotland is much better than it has been, and perhaps for the first time for many years it makes sense, from the point of view of the Ministry of Employment and Productivity, to think in terms of a single school-leaving date.<br><br>
The Minister said—and I suspect there would be a majority opinion with him on this—that the prospect of a school-leaving age at 16 years and 11 months was too big a jump. I wonder whether that is true. Perhaps the advantages of a coherent year outweigh the seeming impossibility of having those near their seventeenth birthday stay on at school. It may be argued that this would be difficult on grounds of discipline, but I raise the query whether the discipline difficulties have something to do with puberty and are not so much related to their chronological age. In that respect I would think the difficulty in the minds of teachers about keeping pupils over 16½ years of age at school are not as great as they may be made out.<br><br>
I support this Clause enthusiastically, and I hope the Minister and his Department will see fit to enter into serious discussions with the C.B.I., the T.U.C. and the S.T.U.C. on these matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are talking here of one or two leaving dates for the year and the disruption that would be caused by having more leaving dates. But is there not a rather more serious situation arising now in that those over 17 who have taken the Higher Leaving Certificate in May can thereafter, for the rest of the summer term, June and part of July, see no further point in staying at school? Because there is no actual authority to keep them there they tend to leave school and take temporary employment until they hear the results of the Higher Certificate Examination, or begin permanent employment. Surely, this is a tendency we must deprecate, because we are virtually losing from the schools the senior pupils, perhaps prefects or the captains of games, who should be there to the end of the school term. Are the Government turning their minds to this problem, which, I believe, is a developing one?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would like a little notice of the last point. I know the problem
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 474</span>
the hon. Gentleman has in mind. It is true that at one time it was not possible for the pupil to get the Leaving Certificate unless he stayed to the end of the term, but I do not think that that applies at present. There are certainly areas where directors of education and headmasters have insisted on pupils staying until the end of the term if they wished to sit for the Scottish Certificate Examinations. I take the hon. Member's point but it is not an easy one to solve in the present circumstances. Perhaps I can write him on it.<br><br>
I would not disagree with a good deal of what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell). Employment considerations are diminishing rather than increasing, although there are still areas, and not only in Scotland, where employment conditions can be rather difficult and where there might be difficulty in placing a particular kind of school leaver in employment with only a single leaving date. I accept his general point that that aspect is becoming less important but I would not accept that the problem has yet disappeared.<br><br>
In the last year we have had discussions with the C.B.I., the T.U.C. and the S.T.U.C, and there is at present no demand in Scotland for a single leaving date. One reason for that, certainly among education authorities, is their expectation of a change in the school leaving age in 1972 and their feeling that if a single date were introduced and then the leaving age were raised we should be keeping at school, in some cases, pupils up to the age of 16 years and 11 months who, in present circumstances, would be expecting to leave at the age of 15 years and 4 months. I do not see anything shocking in the idea of pupils being compelled to stay at school till the age of 16 years and 11 months, but that would be making a considerable change, and I know of no support among education authorities at present, or among teachers' associations, for the idea of a single leaving date simultaneously with, or shortly after, the raising of the school leaving age.<br><br>
We have recently discussed employment questions with the S.T.U.C. and other bodies and there is there, at present, no support for a single leaving date. I certainly take the view that almost
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0707">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 475</span>
inevitably this is something which should come. I cannot put a date to it but it would come some time after the raising of the school leaving age, and this Bill would give us that opportunity. But that is looking a good deal ahead, and there will, no doubt, be considerable consultations and the opportunity for all kinds of viewpoints to be put before we change the situation.<br><br>
We are concerned now with getting the Act in a way which allows flexibility. We are not concerned today with taking the kind of decisions which a future Secretary of State might consider taking in 1974-75. That is too far ahead in education to think about now, even taking account of my hon. Friend's point on the necessity of planning ahead.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 476</span>
It may be possible for me to cover this morning the point arising on Amendment 55, because I hope the hon. Gentleman will be able to produce some figures for us on Thursday morning. Clearly, the first Amendment is a probing one. In the Clause as it stands education authorities are charged with the duty of providing for the dental inspection of pupils "at appropriate intervals". I would like to know what the Minister has in mind by that term and what are considered to be "appropriate intervals" for the inspection of children's teeth.<br><br>
In particular—and this is the main point of my Amendment—I want to know to what extent it will be possible to staff the School Dental Service to provide for inspection at whatever appropriate intervals are required. There is a shortage of dentists in school service at present and I should be grateful to the hon. Gentleman if, when he comes to reply on Thursday next, he can provide us with the latest figures of the number of dentists in the School Dental Service and explain the shortage to us. Clearly, while he is right to provide in this Clause that inspection should be insisted on, it is also right that we should provide for the consequence of that insistence, which is, the provision of a sufficient staff of dentists to carry out that work. I hope the Minister will be able to tell us what the "appropriate intervals" are to be and how inspections at those intervals are to be carried out with a force which I understand to be quite substantially short.</span></p>
