<section>
<div class='page-header'><h1>EDUCATION (SCOTLAND) BILL</h1></div>
<p>4.0 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thomas Oswald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Jennings, or a point of clarification. Is it not a fact that hon. Members, immediately they enter the body of the Committee room, are regarded as being present? That being so, and a Quorum having been formed, should not proceedings have been commenced?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a possibility, but not a practical one. If an hon. Member comes into the room, and then leaves, and the Quorum is thereby lost, I have to accept the fact. When the hon. Gentleman rose earlier to speak, there was no quorum. There was, therefore, no Committee in being.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Iain MacArthur</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order. It is our wish to make progress, and to complete the Bill, if possible, quite quickly this afternoon. But the Government are not helping us at all. During previous sittings we have called attention to the fact that it is thanks to the good offices of the Opposition that we have been able to make progress at all.<br><br>
Despite the late appearance of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Hugh D. Brown), who has just appeared on the Government side of the Committee, there is still not a Quorum on that side. It is shocking and scandalous that the Under-Secretary of State, who proposed the Sittings Motion for us to sit this afternoon, has not been able to arrange for sufficient of his hon. Friends to be present to enable the Bill to make progress. My hon. Friends are here. If they were to leave the Room now—and I advise them not to—we should break the Committee and suspend the proceedings indefinitely.<br><br>
I call attention to this point, Mr. Jennings, in view of the arguments advanced by the Minister at sittings, and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 658</span>
because of the fact that it is thanks to the Opposition's anxiety to make progress that we can make any advance at all.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is not a point of order. The hon. Member is allowed to draw attention to such matters, but I would point out that a Quorum in a Committee is not necessarily provided by either one side or the other. It is the total number of hon. Members in a Committee which forms a Quorum.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward M. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have said that it was not a point of order, but I will allow the hon. Gentleman to intervene.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not the primary re sponsibility of the Government to provide a quorum—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is not a point of order. It is not the primary responsibility of a Government to provide a Quorum. It is the responsibility of hon. Members to be present. It is the total that is taken.</span></p>
<p><i>Schedule 1 agreed to.</i></p>

Schedule 2</div> <!-- schedule -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
MINOR AND CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Bruce Millan)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 65, in page 37, leave out line 19.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At the same time, it will be convenient to take Amendment No. 66, in Schedule 3, page 43, column 3, leave out lines 24 to 26.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This Amendment has the effect of reinstating in the 1962 Act the proviso to subsection (3) of Section 118, which is one of the Sections dealing with the question of endowments. We looked at this aspect earlier. We had taken out this proviso, that in any reorganisation of an endowment the Secretary of State will have regard to the education of children belonging to the poorer classes, when that has been expressly provided for in the original governing instrument.<br><br>
We had taken it out originally, thinking that it was rather inadequately worded
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0807">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 659</span>
for today's circumstances but, on reconsideration, I think that perhaps something would be lost by eliminating this proviso. The Amendment reinstates it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure what happens to the words "such examinations" in page 37—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They are not there.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am just trying to show, Mr. Jennings, that it is the duty of all members of this Committee, on both sides, to be interested in the business of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 33, in page 37, line 41, at end insert:
<br><blockquote><p>(<i>e</i>) any other body of accountants established in the United Kingdom and for the time being recognised for the purposes of section 161(1)(a) of the Companies Act 1948 by the Board of Trade; but a Scottish firm may be so appointed if each of the partners therein is qualified to be so appointed.</p></blockquote>
This is a drafting Amendment to bring the list of persons who may be appointed as auditors of educational endowments into line with the list of accountants contained in, for example, the Teaching Council (Scotland) Act, 1965.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 63, in page 39, line 31, at end insert:
<br><blockquote><p>(e) in paragraph (17), for the words from 'or organising' to 'Act' there shall be substituted the words 'for social, cultural or recreative activities or for physical education or training,';</p></blockquote>
This, again, is a drafting Amendment of a minor nature, designed to simplify the definition of "educational establishment "which is set out in paragraph 17 of Section 145 of the 1962 Act, which is the definition Section.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 52, in page 40, line 4, after 'educational', insert 'clinical'.<br><br>
The effect of this Amendment is to enable a psychological examination under Clause 11 to be given by a clinical psychologist appointed by an education authority for the purpose, as well as by
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 660</span>
an educational psychologist. Because of a point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Maryhill (Mr. Hannan), I gave notice when we were discussing Clause 11 that there was an Amendment on the Order Paper to include clinical psychologists where that was desirable.<br><br>
In the majority of cases the psychological examination of the handicapped child should be carried out by an educational psychologist. There are, however, a minority of cases in which it might be more appropriate to have a clinical psychologist carrying out the examination. That is a view which, incidentally, the psychologists themselves in general accept. The kind of case which I have in mind is, for example, that of the severely handicapped spastic child in which a clinical psychologist would be a rather more appropriate person in the normal circumstances than an educational psychologist. This Amendment enables us to use one or the other, whichever is the more appropriate in the circumstances.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That this be the Second Schedule to the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This may be an appropriate time to return to a question which we have raised on several occasions during the Committee stage. Understandably—and I make no criticism of the Minister—the 1969 Bill makes a substantial number of Amendments to the parent Act of 1962. During the course of our discussions on the Clauses of the Bill we have, from time to time, called attention to the wide nature of the changes which are made to the parent Act. I suggested in an earlier debate that the extent of the changes were such that they might provide some difficulty and confusion for people outside the House of Commons whose duty requires them to study the 1969 Bill and its impact on the parent Act of 1962.<br><br>
The extent of the changes is revealed only when we reach Schedule 2. There are some eight-and-a-half pages in the first part of Schedule 2 alone. They include 40 paragraphs, all of which make Amendments to the 1962 Act. I have made a count—and I do not suggest that it is necessarily accurate—and to the 'best of my arithmetic, in the first part of Schedule 2 there are no fewer than 78
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0808">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 661</span>
Amendments to the 1962 Act. By the time anyone outside the Committee has incorporated the Amendments included in the 1969 Bill in the 1962 Act, that Act will hardly be recognisable because of the number of deletions and insertions and the general changing around which will have taken place following this enactment.<br><br>
I, therefore, ask the Minister again what proposals he has in mind for a consolidation Bill. I assure him that a consolidation Bill, provided that it made no new erosions into the principle of freedom, would receive our support. We wish to see a simplified Act on the Statute Book which would incorporate the remaining parts of the 1962 Act and the changes included in the Bill. If, however, we allow things to stand as they are, and allow this Schedule to go through unchallenged, it will be extremely difficult for people in local authorities and elsewhere who have to deal with the decisions of the Committee to find their way through the mass of apparently conflicting legislation. A consolidation Measure is urgently required. I hope that the Minister will explain what he has in mind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps it is unfair to throw questions at the Minister—indeed at any Minister—after the drumming they have had at Question Time downstairs. But I wish to put two points seriously. First, I did not appreciate, until I became a member of an education authority, the extent to which Bills such as this are used, day to day, in their work. I used to think of Acts as being kept in musty cupboards and being brought out only for occasional reference. But in Glasgow it was the normal thing, day by day, to refer to Acts.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will consider the difficulty of anyone looking up a section in the 1962 Act and then having to look through these Schedules to see which changes have been made. A consolidation Measure is a matter for urgency, and I hope that the Minister will at least inquire of education authorities, the E.I.S. and other teachers' bodies about the extent to which these Acts are used, day by day, in their normal work. That, if nothing else, should convince him how important it is quickly to bring forward a Measure of Consolidation.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 662</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Clark Hutchison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I have mentioned in this Committee before, the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) about the difficulty of following Acts is valid. It is not fair that the Committee should be churning out legislation which makes life intolerable for the practising lawyer, the accountant or local authorities. This is not a party point. Our machinery is wrong. I beg the Minister please to look at this point on other Bills, and on this Bill. If he brings in a consolidation Measure, I am certain that we on our side of the Committee will let it pass almost on the nod.</span></p>
<p>4.15 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take it from the debate at least that Schedule 2 is agreeable to the Committee. I am glad of that.<br><br>
The point about consolidation raised by hon. Gentlemen is valid. I recollect the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) raising similar points when his party was in Government. He is not, as he says, making a party point about it. He is making a genuine point, which I accept.<br><br>
This is a problem with which we are faced in every piece of legislation. Inevitably legislation is so complex these days that it is impossible to introduce a new Bill without making considerable changes to existing legislation. That causes difficulty to those who are to administer the new legislation. In this case the changes have been discussed with the local education authorities who are principally involved. When the Act is passed we shall issue circulars which draw attention to the points of change which are most germane to them in their day-to-day working.<br><br>
Apart from that, there is a good case for consolidating legislation following the Bill. The Secretary of State mentioned that on Second Reading and I mentioned it at least once during the Committee stage. A consolidation Act will neither erode nor expand parental freedom, be cause if it is a genuine consolidating Measure it does nothing except consolidate the existing legislation. We certainly have this very much in mind, and I can give a promise that we shall consider consolidating legislation as soon as possible after this Bill is passed.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0809">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 663</span>
I cannot fix a date for that or give any promise more specific than that which I have given, because I have to look at the field of legislation as a whole. But I certainy accept the validity of the points which have been made on this Schedule.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to go on rubbing the Minister's nose in the need for consolidation legislation, but I hope that he will say a little more to us about what he means by "consideration". What we want is a consolidation Measure, soon and urgently. If the consolidation Measure went no further than the present Bill, or the Act of 1962, it would, I feel certain, be assured of a fairly speedy passage through this Committee and through the House.<br><br>
While I make no party point about this—because I believe that the need for consolidation confronts every Government and every party—we must know what "consideration" means. We know that the Government have been considering for years the need to redefine the law regarding the rating of agricultural buildings. We raised this point at Question Time today. This has gone on year after year and nothing has happened. We know that the Government have been considering the Hunter Report year after year, but nothing has happened. So it goes on, Mr. Jennings, and I shall not abuse your courtesy or that of the Committee by going through the long and turgid list of recommendations and reports, all of which require urgent action, which the present Government keep considering without doing anything about them.<br><br>
Therefore, when the Minister says that he will consider this, I accept his word in good faith, but I should like to have some clear indication of what he is going to do about it, and when.<br><br>
After all, if we look at paragraph 40 in Schedule 2, which is the last paragraph in the part of the Schedule which amends the 1962 Act, we find that diis is not just one paragraph amending one part of the 1962 Act. It goes on and on, almost <i>ad nauseam,</i> making a whole range of changes to the 1962 Act, all of which involve complications for those in public service outside this House, who have to deal with this Act, as my hon. Friends say, in their day-to-day working lives. There are paragraphs (<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>), (<i>c</i>)
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 664</span>
and (<i>d</i>) all the way down the alphabet to paragraph (<i>q</i>), each one of which makes at least one and sometimes more changes to the 1962 Act.<br><br>
I hope the hon. Gentleman will be able to assure us that this will not only be considered, because we know what that means in this Government's tenure of office, but considered as a matter of genuine urgency, so that we can be presented with a consolidation Measure which will make sense of these various amendments, and allow those in public service outside to conduct their day-today lives with greater ease than this confused state of legislation will make possible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that the parallels that the hon. Gentleman drew are valid. For example, the Hunter Report would require legislation which would be substantive legislation, changing the law as it stands at the present time. When we talk about consolidating legislation the sense in which I was discussing it, we are thinking of a straight consolidation Measure, which does not, of course, come before Parliament in the normal way, but goes through the consolidation procedure, which is largely technical and does not take up the time of the House.<br><br>
That is what I had in mind. I was not saying that we were going to have another consolidating Measure which would introduce a whole lot of substantive changes, because that would then be subject to the normal difficulties about fitting legislation into any Government's programme. I was talking about consolidation, in the technical sense, which allows that process to be carried through without going through the normal Parliamentary procedure that applies to legislation.<br><br>
I have stated that I shall consider this as soon as the Bill is through. I am not able to make any more specific promise than that, because there are a number of fields in which consolidation is required. I cannot say that we might be able to do the education legislation before something else which might also very much require to be done. I take the point that there is a very strong case for consolidation. My right hon. Friend mentioned this in his Second Reading speech and we certainly intend to pursue
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0810">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 665</span>
this as rapidly as possible once we get the Bill.</span></p>

ENACTMENTS REPEALED</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Amendment 66 made,</i> in page 43, column 3, leave out lines 24 to 26.—[<i>Mr. Millan.</i>]</p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the Schedule, as amended, be the Third Schedule to the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clark Hutchison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to direct attention to Section 9(2) of the 1962 Act, which is mentioned in the Schedule. I accept that the new Clause which we dis cussed yesterday was probably imperfectly drafted and that it was better not to retain it. However, it was put in because we are now removing Section 9(2)—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is out of order, unforunately for the hon. Member. This Schedule is literally consequential on the previous Schedule, which was fully debated. This Schedule, in practice, should be taken formally. We cannot argue its merits or demerits now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clark Hutchison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Then I may say that I am not satisfied with what happened before. I will have to vote against it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can understand the hon. Gentleman's difficulty, but I must point out that he ought to have raised this matter on Schedule 2. I am sorry about that, but it was dealt with in paragraph 5 of Schedule 2. That is the difficulty. The hon. Gentleman seems to have missed his chance. But, in any case, I dealt with this yesterday on an earlier Amendment. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will consider what I said then. He can raise this matter on Report, if he wishes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Without going into the merits and demerits of the case, would it be in order to ask the Minister one question?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot say, until I know what the question is.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The question is: in view of what the Minister said yesterday about
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 666</span>
the discussions, will he, perhaps, before Report, take the opportunity at Question Time of reporting to the House on the discussions which he is to hold?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will certainly consider that suggestion. The discussions should be held within the next day or two.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clark Hutchison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. I do not quite understand the position, because Section 9(2) is clearly mentioned in Schedule 3, and I do not see why I may not speak on it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is difficult, as the Minister said. The opportunity to speak, particularly on the conscience Clause, which I think the hon. Gentleman is discussing, should have been taken on Schedule 2. These enactments which are consequentially to be repealed result from what has previously taken place in the Committee. They are simply consequential. No long or even short debate may take place on them. The opportunity was missed on Schedule 2.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clark Hutchison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not understand why Schedule 3 refers to the extent of repeal. I do not want this provision repealed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It has already happened. That is the whole point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Have we not already, in passing Schedule 2, agreed by paragraph 5 that Section 9(2) shall cease to have effect? Having decided that it shall cease to have effect—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was decided. That is why discussion is out of order now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With great respect, Mr. Jennings, may I say how much I appreciate the guidance which you are giving us. My hon. Friends are in some difficulty here. I think that I can guess the point which they wish to raise, and whether it is a good point is not for me to say at this stage. The fact, however, is that my hon. Friends were quite clearly waiting until Schedule 3 in order to raise whatever point it is that they wish to raise. I submit that the present difficulty is a reflection of the curious form of these Schedules.<br><br>
I accept that this is not a new departure in legislation. What I am saying
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0811">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 667</span>
simply reflects the way in which legislation is presented to the House. Paragraph 5 of Schedule 2 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"In section 9"</p></blockquote>
—of the 1962 Act—
<br><blockquote><p>"subsection (2) shall cease to have effect"</p></blockquote>
I assume, Mr. Jennings, your Ruling is that because that was a requirement of Schedule 2, and because we have accepted Schedule 2, that subsection has ceased to have effect.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that case, why is it necessary to go on, in Schedule 3, to discuss in theory whether that subsection should be repealed?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can answer that straight away. The hon. Gentleman knows as well as I do the machinery of Bills, particularly when we reach Schedules. A number of insertions in the Bill are consequential upon what has taken place previously in the Bill. This is one of them.<br><br>
I appreciate the difficulty of hon. Members, but they should have spoken on, or voted against, Schedule 2 in order to make the point. It cannot be discussed under Schedule 3.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clark Hutchison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But it can be voted against?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Anything that is put to the Committee can be voted on. If I put the Question, as I must, it can be voted upon. If hon. Members wish to vote against it, that is their business.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to welcome Sched ule 3, because it does something for which hon. Members opposite were ask ing when we discussed Schedule 2. There are only three Opposition Members present</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is thanks to us and to our devotion in being here and not at other pressing engagements that the right hon. Gentleman and his friends can continue discussion of the Bill. I must tell the right hon. Gentleman that if he continues speaking in that way, my hon. Friends and I will leave this Committee room and the Bill will collapse.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My reply to that is that if hon. Gentlemen opposite do so, they will demonstrate quite clearly to the people of Scotland that they do not care two hoots about the Education (Scotland) Bill. If they wish to make that impression, well and good. They are the keepers of their own conscience, not of mine.<br><br>
I support the Schedule, because it helps people to follow quickly and easily some of the Amendments made in Schedule 2. Precisely for that reason, it is a very useful Schedule. One has only to look at it to see, for instance, that Section 77 of the Education Act, 1962, is wiped out, as in Section 78. This is what hon. Members opposite wanted.</span></p>
<p>4.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members opposite wanted a consolidation Bill. I agree with that wish, and have every sympathy with it. I have made the same speeches on some of the horrible abortions of Bills which were sent to Committees when hon. Gentlemen opposite were the Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is straying out of order. Let me sum up emphasising that the Schedule is simply a check list of enactments which are repealed. It is, in a sense, a form of consolidation Schedule. In that sense, most points have been mentioned or debated before in the Bill. I do not think that we should waste much more time on this point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. We are grateful to you for your advice and guidance on this matter, Mr. Jennings. One of the reasons why no specific Amendment was made was that advice was given to me, upon which I should value your advice. I was advised that if we did not table a specific Amendment to Schedule 2—and, in consequence, a specific Amendment to Schedule 3—but sought to raise a general point by means of a new Clause, the opportunity to discuss the specific point on Report would thereby be greater, although not guaranteed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The question of what hon. Members should do is largely a question of tactics and is not for me to decide. The hon. Gentleman asked my
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0812">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 669</span>
advice. It is that hon. Members who wish to raise these points missed their opportunity when we debated Schedule 2. The hon. Gentleman had a new Clause down which was extensively debated on a particular point affecting Schedule 2. On Schedule 3 my answer is "No" because it consists of repealed enactments, a consolidated check list; that is all these are.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. If we had had a substantial debate on the specific matter in Schedule 2, would it not have meant that our opportunity of having a debate on a specific Amendment on Report, should the need arise, would be thereby lessened?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot say what would have happened if certain actions which have not been taken by hon. Members had been taken. The question of the Report stage has nothing to do with me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Hannan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have not finished my speech.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hannan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Jennings. You have already ruled that discussion on Schedule 3 is out of order. Therefore, should we not now proceed to take the vote?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is what I am trying to do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was keeping very strictly in order by commenting on the desirability of leaving this Schedule in the Bill. It is highly desirable that it should be kept in the Bill because it meets the wishes of hon. Gentlemen opposite in making an easy guide to the changes that are made in Schedule 2. It therefore seems to be a very valuable Schedule. I can only think that the obtuseness of Members opposite is due to the fact that they have just received such a severe drubbing in the House that they are still bemused. They are not following what is going on. I have great sympathy for them, but it does not alter the fact that the Committee will pass the Schedule.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order, Let me repeat, if I were to allow a debate on the matters contained in this Schedule we certainly
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 670</span>
would not finish today. This is a check list, a form of consolidation of enactments repealed, and I do not intend to allow a debate on any of the subjects. They have already been touched upon in previous debates. I intend to put the Question very soon.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With great respect, it is not my intention to debate the repeals in Schedule 3 because, as you rightly say, if we were to do that it would involve us in a debate which could go on for weeks. However, I wish to call attention to one point which arises from what I said on Schedule 2, which is the need for consolidation.<br><br>
The right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) has not quite grasped what is in our minds. Schedule 3 lists those parts of previous enactments which are to be repealed. So far as the 1962 Act is concerned, Schedule 3 provides for 33 repeals. Although it is a nuisance for local authorities, the procedure is simple. One takes the 1962 Act off the shelf and draws a line through 33 Sections or paragraphs of that Act which are repealed by Schedule 3. But the right hon. Gentleman, with respect, is quite wrong in suggesting that Schedule 3 is simply a check list for Schedule 2. It is nothing of the kind. Certainly it repeats 33 of the points of change which are contained in Schedule 2. But, beyond that, there are in the Second Schedule an additional 45 Amendments to the 1962 Act. They are not repeated in Schedule 3 because they are not matters of repeal, but of amendment. I will not pursue this point. I simply call attention to the serious complication which these two Schedules taken together will present for local authorities and for those people in the public service outside this House. I call attention yet again to the urgent need for a consolidation Measure.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 49, in page 45, line 24, at end insert:
<br><blockquote><p>'being a decision duly notified to the parent of the child under paragraph (i) of subsection (1) of that section'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this Amendment it would be convenient also to take Amendment No. 50.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These are, again, purely drafting Amendments. They are required to clarify the transitional provisions concerning decisions under earlier legislation that a child requires special educational treatment. By paragraph 7(1) of the Schedule any earlier decision is deemed to be a decision under Section 65 of the Act as set out in the Bill. This would, without these Amendments, on the face of it require authority to give to the parent a notice which, in terms of Section 65(2), (might then involve the appeal procedure. In fact, of course, it is not necessary to do that because we provide further on in the Schedule for cases where an appeal procedure may be in operation when the Bill comes into operation. These two Amendments clarify, therefore, what is intended by the transitional provisions for children subject to special education.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Further Amendment made:</i> Amendment No. 50, in page 45, line 33, at end insert:
<br><blockquote><p>'but so however that section 66A of the principal Act as set out in this Act shall not (except in so far as it relates to a determination under section 66 of the principal Act as so set out) apply in relation to a decision deemed by virtue of paragraph (i) above to be a decision under section 56 of the principal Act as so set out'.—[<i>Mr. Millan.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I thank hon.

I am not sure whether this is the first occasion on which you have presided over the Scottish Committee, but, if it is, I think that you have been remarkably tolerant of all our Scottish eccentricities. I am sure that I speak on behalf of all members of the Committee in thanking you, and wishing that we may have the pleasure of having you as our Chairman of the Scottish Committee some time again in the near future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I, on behalf of my hon.
