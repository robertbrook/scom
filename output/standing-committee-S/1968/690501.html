NEW PROVISION AS TO ENFORCEMENT NOTICES</div> <!-- title -->
<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have a short announcement to make, that owing to a withdrawal of labour in the Parliamentary Press we shall have to work from Tuesday's Notice Paper.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. N. R. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 124, in page 15, line 15, leave out "to use as a single dwelling-house".<br><br>
Subsection (3) qualifies the earlier provisions of the Clause to the extent that in certain circumstances an enforcement notice can only be served within a specified period of four years, and the categories of cases to which this restrictive provision applies are set out in paragraphs (<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>) and (c) of the subsection. One of these categories is where the alleged breach of planning control consists in
<br><blockquote><p>"the making without planning permission of a change of use of any building to use as a single dwelling-house."</p></blockquote>
This is really a probing Amendment, to find out why the restriction is confined to this situation and does not apply to change of use generally.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Dr. J. Dickson Mabon)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The main reason why we have made what, I agree, is a special exception to the general rule is on humanitarian grounds. We thought there ought to be a point at which a householder is secure from eviction or planning grounds. After all, the person on whom the enforcement notice would be served could conceivably not be the person who was in the house at the time of the conversion. He may not have
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 296</span>
known that the conversion had not received planning permission. In addition, intensification is normally not a problem with a single dwellinghouse, and if the residential use is anti-social—for example, multiple occupation—it should have called attention to itself within the four years. So it is possible, without any loss of planning control, to give immunity after four years in this special case. I am sure the hon. and learned Gentleman will agree that that is quite a sensible reservation to make in this single case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that is right. But if the restriction is put forward on humanitarian grounds, the same problem is going to arise at any period. The planning authority is going to be able to exercise a power of eviction at any time within a period of four years. So on the hon. Gentleman's own argument of humanitarian grounds, is there not something to be said for narrowing substantially the period within which this type of enforcement notice can be served? I appreciate that it is much better to have a terminal date in a situation like this, but in the light of his own reply will he consider whether it is desirable to have that terminal date rather shorter than the period of four years?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Dickson Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With respect, I am perfectly willing to argue that on the next Amendment, which the hon. and learned Gentleman has put down, suggesting three instead of four. I will willingly defend that decision then. But at the moment I am defending the principle that there should be this exception to the general rule.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The next Amendment is No. 125 and, subject to the approval of the Committee, I suggest that with it we should discuss Amendment No. 126, in Clause 16, page 16, line 19, leave out 'four' and insert 'three'.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 125, in page 15, line 17, leave out 'four' and insert 'three'.<br><br>
This is the kind of Amendment that comes up in the Scottish Standing Committee from time to time. It is really a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0981">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 297</span>
probing Amendment. The period of three years as a period within which judicial proceedings in certain circumstances alone can be taken is quite well known in the law by Statute, and I just wonder why the period of four years was selected here rather than the period of three years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Dempsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In developing his argument, can the hon. and learned Gentleman say why not two years? Was not two years the general rule which applied for a long time?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Being the victim of habit, I am used to three years as the period in the last fifteen years or so in which judicial proceedings in certain classes of case could be taken. The hon. Gentleman may be right. Perhaps three years is too long and we ought to make it two years. But, certainly, we shall be interested to know why the period of four years was taken.<br><br>
After all, this is an exception to the general rule. This is a limiting provision. It provides a terminal date by which an enforcement notice must be served, and, presumably, the period of four years is one reached deliberately after due consideration. Subject to anything the Minister may say, I suggest that three years might be more appropriate, but, as his hon. Friend has pointed out, the period of two years might equally be considered. Although this time limit applies to all the circumstances set out in subsection (3), it may very well be argued on humanitarian grounds that a shorter period would be appropriate in the case of paragraph (c).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I quite accept the point that the length of the time limit is clearly a matter of judgment. I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge and Airdrie (Mr. Dempsey) was not arguing that it should be two years. He was pointing out that at the moment local planning authorities have two years in which to decide whether to take action after the breach has come to their notice.<br><br>
Our suggestion in the Clause of four years is based on the argument that there should be this two-year period, to which my hon. Friend has drawn attention, plus an equal period during which the breach
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 298</span>
may come to their notice, which it may do, as a result of the vigilance of their own officials, or, often, as a result of a complaint from a member of the public. It takes time for a breach to be noticed. At first the new activity may be assumed to be merely a temporary matter, or it may begin in a small way that does not attract attention, or the neighbour who dislikes the unauthorised development may try persuasion before resorting to an official complaint. It seem reasonable, therefore, that there should be at least as long a period for the breach to come to light as for the consideration of whether an enforcement notice should be served. That is why we have chosen the four-year period. I am perfectly open to persuasion on this matter, but I must say that, having considered it, and having realised that there has to be a definite figure, I think that three years is too short and four years is just right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the existing provisions are set out in Section 21 of the 1947 Act, and that provides that an enforcement notice may be invoked within two years after it has come to the knowledge of the local authority that the development has been carried on. Does the hon. Gentleman wish to speak?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dempsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was anxious to make the point of the difficulty of a breach being discovered, and I was hoping that the hon. and learned Gentleman was not winding up the debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Member wants to speak, I will give him an opportunity of doing so. There is no question of winding up the debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Section 21 safeguards the position of the local authority, because it provides that the local authority may, within two years after it has come to its knowledge that such development has been so carried out, or that such conditions have not ben complied with, serve a notice if it considers it expedient to do so. So that the local authorities' position at the moment is safeguarded by the fact that they have this period within which the breach has come to their notice; and two years is used in a different context from the present provision, because the present provision provides a period of four years from the date of the breach.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0982">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 299</span>
Have earlier provisions not been working satisfactorily? What is the reason for this change?<br><br>
I think we were accused of making an assault on local authorities the other day. It seems to me that, in a sense, this is striking at the local authorities to the extent that there is a period given to be calculated from the date of the breach, apart altogether from the date on which the notice of the breach comes to the local authority. I quite agree that it is very much a discretionary matter, but when we are making quite a change from the existing Section 21 provisions the Committee would like to know whether the existing provisions have resulted in hardship, or whether they have not been operated satisfactorily.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dempsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was very happy to hear my hon. Friend say that he is open to persuasion on this issue, because it raises some very difficult problems. It is almost impossible to determine the date when a breach takes place, and it is quite possible that an unofficial development will go on for years before it is detected. My hon. Friend said that after a breach is detected, and although it may have gone on for two or three years, the authority will then have four years' discretion beyond that period. That seems to me to be a very long time in which to bring some law and order into a community. I agree it is quite conceivable that in a built-up area a breach will be detected at an early date. Some people may complain about the noise, others about the activity, others about the vermin which some form of action is causing, which convinces people that something is going on and a report is made to the local planning authority. We had a case recently where this had happened in a built-up area, where six houses were closed but no one was aware that one had been re-opened and decorated and curtains had been put up in the windows. It was being used as a store for television sets which were hawked around the community at a nominal price. That was detected, because someone reported it to the local council and asked whether planning consent had been given.<br><br>
My hon. Friend should look at another aspect and should remember the difficulty of locating a breach in the rural
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 300</span>
areas. People are not walking around such areas every day or week or month, and an activity could continue for a long time before being discovered. Someone could quite easily open up a garage and start doing repairs, and could finish up with quite a business, and others could use the facilities for scrap, etcetera. This has actually happened, and I have had a bit of experience of such developments which certainly spoil an area. The object of planning is to ensure that communities are very wisely planned on behalf of those who live in the neighbourhood, and not on behalf of a selfish individual who is not concerned with community planning so long as he can look after No. 1.<br><br>
10.45 a.m.<br><br>
Has my hon. Friend considered that this period of four years, from the point of view of rural communities, could possibly be too long? I am open to persuasion, but I feel that this is one aspect which he must take into consideration in the rural communities in many parts of Scotland. In these parts of the country thriving businesses can be going on and not discovered for quite a long period.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure what my hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge and Airdrie (Mr. Dempsey) is arguing about. Is he arguing for a longer period?<br><br>
I will accept the invitation of the hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) to explain why we are taking this step. The rule giving immunity from an enforcement notice after two years is abolished. The two-year rule is based on the date of discovery. The four-year rule we are offering here is from the date of the breach. I think my hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge and Airdrie will welcome that. Although we are abolishing the two-year enforcement rule, in the majority of cases nothing is put in its place. Enforcement can take place after any interval of time except for certain types of development. We have discussed only the dwellinghouse and, broadly speaking, building operations. These two categories will be subject to the new four-year rule based on the date of the breach.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dempsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My concern is that a particular breach may continue in a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0983">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 301</span>
rural area for many years before it is detected. Enforcement action can be taken two years after the date, of detection, whereas my hon. Friend suggests now four years after the breach, but in a rural area a breach may not for many years be noted and reported.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is quite right. We are not changing the time limit, which is limitless in respect of any subject other than building operations, which usually can be seen, and a single dwellinghouse, for the reason I gave, and which the Opposition have accepted. When we are talking about the four-year limit, that is in relation to building operations, to conditions attached to planning permissions, or to single dwellinghouses. In the case of the private enterprise example my hon. Friend gave, this is a matter of breach of the criminal law, and not breach of the planning law.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dempsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This was a closed house and was condemned. It was reopened and decorated, and used as a storehouse, a change of use, without planning consent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would imagine that there were probably three infringements of the law, certainly two, but if I were the Chief Constable for that area I would proceed on a criminal charge and not on a planning charge. [<i>Interruption.</i>] Despite what my hon. Friend the Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel) says I do not think they were from Lanarkshire, but were incomers. My hon. Friend must not be too antagonistic to Lanarkshire.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Archie Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not antagonistic. I rather admire them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The abolition would make the determination of status of property for planning purposes more difficult as time went on. I am willing to look at this again. I am not thirled to the four years as such, although I think it is logical to have four years. The exception should be only for building operations and single dwellinghouses—building operations because they can be seen; and single dwellinghouses deserve consideration on humanitarian grounds.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to this debate There are one or two other points which might be more
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 302</span>
appropriate on the Question, That the Clause stand part of the Bill, but as I understand that the Minister has an open mind on this subject, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I call Amendment No. 22, and, subject to the approval of the Committee, we will take with it Amendment No. 23, in Clause 16, page 16, line 27, leave out '(4)' and insert '(5)', and No. 24, in page 17, line 8, to leave out '(4)' and insert '(5)'.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 22, in page 15, line 18, at end insert:
<br><blockquote><p>(4) If any dispute arises under the last foregoing subsection as to the date on which the breach of planning control occurred, the onus of proof as to that date shall rest on the person claiming the benefit of that subsection.</p></blockquote>
This is not a probing Amendment. "Any questions" is all right on television but it is different in Committee. This Amendment is designed to remedy a defect to which my hon. Friend the Member for Midlothian (Mr. Eadie) drew attention during Second Reading of the Bill. As has been stated, under the existing arrangements enforcement action can be taken by the local authority, if there is a breach of planning control, within two or three years of notice of the breach. This Clause wipes out that limitation and places no time limit except in those cases specified in subsection (3). Here the time is extended to four years. As the Clause stands, it ceases to be an offence if the developer can claim he carried out the development more than four years before the action enforcement is taken, but the Clause leaves it to the local planning authority to prove that his claim is false. My hon. Friend, during Second Reading debate, pointed out the difficulties about that.<br><br>
This Amendment seeks to place the obligation upon the offender to prove that the development took place more than four years before. This seems to make sense. The developer would have some evidence of the development—of a documentary kind, or witnesses, who would be aware of what he did. The local authority cannot always keep in touch with everything in its area, so it becomes difficult for the local authority to say when the breach took place. The local authority could not get around to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0984">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 303</span>
the extent necessary in order to keep a constant vigilance upon breaches of planning arrangements. Therefore, the obligation should be placed on the defender to prove that the work was carried out more than four years before.<br><br>
This seems to be an eminently sensible Amendment, probably the most sensible Amendment moved during the Committee so far. I hope my hon. Friend will reply very briefly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does not the present position cover the right hon. Gentleman's Amendment? If someone is pleading that an order is time barred the onus would be on the person pleading to establish it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know, but my hon. Friend the Member for Midlothian (Mr. Eadie) raised this matter in the first place because local authorities were concerned about it. We want written into the Bill quite clearly where the obligation lies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know my right hon. Friend has a reputation for brevity and I shall try to emulate him. I would be unfair if I said that this is the best Amendment moved in the Committee so far, but I agree it is the best Amendment my right hon. Friend has moved.<br><br>
I do not dissent from any section of his argument. The Clause as it now stands puts the onus of proof on the local authority, and the local authority would have to do a great deal of detective work which would not be desirable. It would be necessary, but it would be undesirable for it to be carried out, and it would also be difficult. The person who is claiming the benefit, as the hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) mentioned, would have ample evidence at his disposal. I am very much attracted by these Amendments and would like the Committee to make them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would just like to thank my hon. Friend for his new generosity. I knew he was sufficiently intelligent to appreciate the Amendment. I had no doubt he would accept it.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 115, in page 15, line 22, leave out "in the opinion of the authority".<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 304</span>
This provision duplicates earlier provisions in the 1947 Act. I wonder if the Minister could tell us who are the people whom he has in mind who might have an interest in the land so as to justify calling for the service of a notice. Clearly, the owner has such an interest, a lessee has such an interest, an occupier has such an interest, and it goes on,
<br><blockquote><p>"any other person having an interest in that land, being an interest which in the opinion of the authority is materially affected by the notice."</p></blockquote>
Similar provisions in the 1947 Act are to be found in somewhat similar terms, and the Amendment is to ascertain what are the kind of interests that he considers it would be appropriate to intimate such a notice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The reason for the use of these words is in order to avoid any unnecessary litigation and the consequent danger of invalidation of the enforcement notice which could result from disagreement where an interest is materially affected, and their inclusion for this purpose is well precedented. It is difficult to name examples but it could be as minimal as individual membership of a club.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: An angling club.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am embarrassed by my hon. Friend's wisdom this morning.<br><br>
While I confess that these are minimal they might be the subject of an argument, in order to object to the enforcement by saying that, since there is no definitive authority whose opinion is consulted, the matter can be pursued further in litigation. That is the last thing the hon. and learned Gentleman would want to see with the present great burden on lawyers.<br><br>
Experience of enforcement in Scotland shows that local authorities act with a Cull sense of responsibility, and even reluctance. If we leave the words in they will interpret the words "materially affected" in a very reasonable way, and it is in order to avoid unnecessary challenge in the courts, and to cover any minority interest that we may have overlooked, bond holders, for example, that we have included these words. I hope the hon. and learned Gentleman is satisfied.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is taking powers under Clause 16(4)(<i>b</i>) to cover
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0985">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 305</span>
the kind of situation he has in mind. Where someone has not had a notice served on him the Secretary of State may none the less disregard that fact if he is satisfied that
<br><blockquote><p>'neither the appellant nor that person has been substantially prejudiced by the failure to serve him."</p></blockquote>
So there is a safeguarding provision in Clause 16. The Minister is right: these words have to be left in. Certain representations were made to certain hon. Members about them. I do not think they were well founded, but it seemed appropriate to probe the matter. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p>11.0 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Going back briefly to the question of the period within which an enforcement notice can be served, the existing provision, as has already been mentioned is Section 21 of the 1947 Act. That lays emphasis on the date on which a breach comes to the notice of the planning authority, and it provides that if it is within a period of two years the authority must act on that knowledge. It is, in a sense, a statutory recognition of the principle of personal bar. The local authority cannot know of a breach of planning control, do nothing about it for an indefinite period, and allow an individual to prejudice himself financially and otherwise still further, and then, at its whim, come and require him to pay the penalties of the initial breach. This protects the individual, to the extent that it protects him, if there be a risk of abuse by a public authority; but also it protects the local authority in so far as the date within which the authority can serve a notice is related to the date on which a breach of planning control is brought to its attention.<br><br>
Subsection (1) widens this to the detriment of the individual, because there is no time in the wide area of cases of breaches of planning control, the basic proposition being in subsection (1), so that at any time, however long they may sit on it when it is brought to their attention, the local authorities may proceed by enforcement notice. There may be some statutory provision which covers
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 306</span>
it, but so far as I can see, in subsection (1) the limiting provisions of the 1947 Act are removed.<br><br>
Conversely, in subsection (3) for the categories of breaches referred to, there is imposed a definite time limit, related not to the state of knowledge of the planning authority but to the breach itself, and I wonder if that goes too far in the opposite direction.<br><br>
If the local authority did not know of the breach—and the hon. Member for Coatbridge and Airdrie (Mr. Dempsey) was getting at this point—and understandably did not know because of the circumstances, is it right, none the less, to bring the guillotine down, so to speak, after three or four years, whatever period we wish?<br><br>
I did not hear the Minister of State's closing observations on the Amendment moved by his right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis), but I thought that, if a notice is served under this Clause specifying a breach that has taken place within a period of four years, the onus would be on—I do not know that "accused" in the proper word, because these are not criminal proceedings—on the other party to establish that a breach was not constituted in that period but in a longer period. However, I understand that his right hon. Friend's Amendment has been accepted. It may be that there is a time limit for subsection (1) and conversely there may be some provision that subsection (3) would not bite unless a breach had come to the notice of the local authority.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the hon. and learned Member for Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) did not follow all our proceedings on the Amendment moved by my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) because that Amendment was essential. It was a good suggestion, and brought the onus back to where it should be. The person concerned, I am sure, will bring forward evidence to defend his position.<br><br>
We are making two substantial changes. We are changing the date of discovery to the date of breach, and we are introducing a system of certificate of established use procedure over most of the area. This gives us an opportunity to try to look at Scottish practice as it has been in the past and as it is distinct
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0986">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 307</span>
from the practice in England, and to see if we can balance the two.<br><br>
We had long discussions with the local authority representatives about this. We did not, at that time, take the point made by my right hon. Friend, but I am certain that, with that point in the Bill, the local authorities will be even more convinced that this is the right way of proceeding. I would be surprised if they wanted me to alter the figure of four, but I am willing to look at it. Apart from that observation, it is true that the previous system in England and our own system had advantages and disadvantages, but it may be argued that if a breach of planning control which has gone undiscovered cannot be subject to enforcement action the premium is on concealment.<br><br>
The second advantage is that there is no risk of uncertainty arising from breach of control. It is not always the present owner of the property who is necessarily the person causing the offence in the first instance. He may be astounded that the offence has been committed, and it may have been concealed from him. We may be dealing with innocent people, and with property which has changed hands on a false basis, and the value uttered to that person on that basis. It seems a pity to penalise the wrong person.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One appreciates that property can change hands and that continued abuse can happen in ignorance. Is that not why there was this provision, that the local authority could serve a notice if it considered it expedient to do so having regard to the provisions of the development plan and to any other material considerations? That is the kind of discretion which was given to the local authority to deal with the very hardship cases the hon. Gentleman has in mind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Off the cuff, I would not quite say that that was right. There is no time limit for these other matters. By bringing in a system of certificate of established use procedure we are giving some protection to these innocents, placed in this invidious position. It is to strike a balance that we have phrased the Clause this way and chosen a period of four years. I would be grateful if, while I am looking at this, hon. Members would look at the OFFICIAL REPORT of our proceedings and discuss it with their local autho-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 308</span>
rity friends to see whether we have got it right. I think we have made a reasonable job of it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think the Minister of State is right: we should think about this. There are two proposals. One, that as a general rule there will be no time limit and the local authority can come with an enforcement notice at any time unless the position is regularised by an enforcement notice. On the other hand, the local authority could be penalised in certain circumstances by having to recognise a use which constitutes a breach of planning control simply by virtue of the fact that it has been in operation for four years even though the local authority did not know anything about it. I am not critical of the Clause, but these are changes, and one wants to be sure that they are changes for the better, particularly in view of the fact that the earlier provisions have been in operation for a number of years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dempsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have been trying to follow the reasoning of my hon. Friend, and I think he said that he was treating discovery as the date of the breach——</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. We must get it clear that at the moment, under present law, the date of discovery is the date on which the two years is based. This Clause makes the date of breach the date relevant to the four-year period. There is a difference.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dempsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the point has been clarified. Has my hon. Friend ruled out the possibility of a breach of planning control and consent having been going on for years before discovery and before anyone has realised that there has been a certain breach of planning regulations? In these circumstances, having regard to the nature of the offence, is not four years rather a long time before planning authorities may impose an enforcement notice? I am asking him to consider that there are some people who are not so innocent, who by devious ways break laws, break plans, and break society's rules in general. There could be the instance of the fellow who sets up a scrap yard and has that obnoxious practice going on for years. Yet a lackadaisical local authority would have four years to stop that unacceptable type of industry in a housing scheme—where it
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0987">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 309</span>
frequently happens. I would like my hon. Friend, while we are considering our attitude on the details of the dates, to bear that in mind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I admit that this is complicated but if my hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge and Airdrie (Mr. Dempsey) looks at what he said about the example of a scrap yard, this would not fall within this subsection but within the change of use provisions and would therefore have no time limit, so that illustration falls. The only two matters within the time limit would be building operations which one can see and a single dwelling—and that is another argument. It is not that people must wait four years but that within four years—the referee must blow the whistle sometime—the local authorities must act and if they do not, no action can be taken by them. If the hon. Member reads again the complicated discussion on this, he might be less enthusiastic about changing four to a smaller figure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dempsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister.</span></p>

APPEAL AGAINST ENFORCEMENT NOTICE</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Amendments made:</i> No. 23, in page 16, line 27, leave out '(4)' and insert '(5)'; No. 24, in page 17, line 8, leave out '(4)' and insert '(5)'.—[<i>Mr. Willis.</i>]</p>
<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I propose to call Amendment No. 128 and, subject to the approval of the Committee, to have considered with it Amendment No. 129.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 128, in page 17, line 42, leave out "another" and insert "for it any other".<br><br>
These are purely drafting Amendments and I do not intend to take much time on them. The last three lines of subsection (6) at present read as follows:
<br><blockquote><p>"and where under that subsection he discharges a condition or limitation, he may substitute another condition or limitation for it, whether more or less onerous."</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 310</span>
With these two Amendments they would read:
<br><blockquote><p>"and where under that subsection he discharges a condition or limitation, he may subsitute for it any other condition or limitation."</p></blockquote>
The other words "whether more or less onerous" do not seem to us to add anything if the general power is given there.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of including the words "whether more or less onerous" was to make it clear that the power of the Secretary of State, when considering an appeal against an enforcement notice, extends to making conditions more severe as well as to relaxing conditions. I think it is fair that in some contexts there is a general presumption that when a decision is reviewed the person who has appealed ought not to be in any danger of finding himself worse off than he was before. This presumption might mistakenly influence some developers in their thinking about enforcement notices and appeals against them.<br><br>
In point of fact, however, it should be well known that the Secretary of State has power, for example, under Section 14(2) of the 1947 Act, when considering a normal planning appeal, to vary the conditions of a planning permission in either direction, towards more severity or less severity. There should, therefore, be little scope for doubt here, and I would concede that a signpost is not strictly necessary. On that basis I think the Amendment is an improvement on the Bill as it stands, and I would like the Committee to accept both these Amendments.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Further Amendment made:</i> No. 129, in page 17, line 42, leave out 'for it, whether more or less onerous'.—[<i>Mr. Wylie.</i>]</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 130, in page 18, line 14, leave out subsection (8) and insert:
<br><blockquote><p>(8) Subject to the provision of section 31 of the Act of 1959 the decision of the Secretary of State on an appeal under this section shall be final.</p></blockquote>
Clause 16 relates to appeals against an enforcement notice. Clause 18 relates to appeals to the Secretary of State against the refusal of established use certificates, and I notice in subsection (5) of that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0988">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 311</span>
Clause there is the provision which is referred to in this Amendment, namely a reservation of a right of appeal in certain circumstances to the Court of Session. May I just remind the Committee of the provisions of Section 31 of the 1959 Act? What that Section, read shortly, provides is, that if a person is aggrieved by an Order to which the Section relates—and that includes a wide field of Orders; either decisions by the Secretary of State under Section 13 or Section 14 of the 1947 Act, and so forth—or is aggrieved by any action of the Secretary of State to which the Section applies, he may, within six weeks from the date on which the Order was confirmed, or the action taken, as the case may be, make an application to the Court of Session. Therefore, that Section allows an ultimate appeal to the Court of Session. Parliament deemed it advisable to introduce that Section into the 1959 Act. The Minister has deemed it advisable to introduce it into appeals in connection with established use certificates, namely Clause 18(5), and on the face of it, at least, it is difficult to see why a similar provision should not be allowed in the case of appeals in connection with enforcement notices. It was with these considerations in mind that this Amendment, which is rather more substantial than the last one or two, was framed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I believe under the present procedure an appeal against an enforcement order should go to the sheriff. Under this Clause there will be an appeal under the enforcement order which will go to the Secretary of State. In a way this seems to be a method of getting the local plan appealed against to the Secretary of State, which one could not do by a direct appeal. One could, for instance, carry out an operation contrary to the local plan, and therefore push the local authority into bringing in an enforcement order, and then one could appeal to the Secretary of State, which one could not have done where one had appealed against the decision of the local authority in the first place. I think this could give rise to abuse, and perhaps the Minister of State could explain his intent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must confess that this is an important and complicated matter so I will try to take the Committee through the argument as I see it, and I will make any references to existing legisla-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 312</span>
tion as slowly as I can, so that we shall have time to look these up, if necessary.<br><br>
The Amendment substantially redrafts this subsection and it widens the circumstances in which the validity of an enforcement notice can be questioned in further legal proceedings. As it stands, Clause 16 provides fully for appeals to the Secretary of State against enforcement notices. It is, if I may say so, on all fours with Section 21(4) of the 1947 Act, which provided for appeals to the sheriff. I think most people would accept that the change to the Secretary of State is appropriate, since the issues involved are more often for consideration on grounds of technical planning merit than on legal grounds <i>per se.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I would not argue against that; I think it is right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. and learned Gentleman.<br><br>
There is still provision for access to the courts but what we are discussing is the nature of the action in the courts, whether it should be widened or circumscribed by this subsection.<br><br>
The Amendment to Section 31(4) of the 1959 Act, which incidentally we carry out in this Bill by Schedule 8, in paragraph 37(<i>b</i>), includes decisions of the Secretary of State under Clause 16 among the matters which may be appealed against to the Court of Session. It will, therefore, be open to an aggrieved person in appropriate circumstances to challenge the validity of the Secretary of State's decision. It is not intended, however, to allow every unsuccessful appeal to be fought all over again in the courts, irrespective of the grounds of dispute. Some aspect of the appeal will already have been fully argued out. Clause 16(8) therefore, limits the circumstances in which the validity of the enforcement notice can be questioned in legal proceedings by providing that certain of the grounds of appeal on which an appeal can be made to the Secretary of State are not available for court proceedings.<br><br>
In simple terms these excluded grounds are, firstly, that what the enforcement notice alleges is not a breach of planning control; secondly, that the notice is out of time; thirdly, that the breach took place before the beginning of 1965 and was thus condoned by Clause 16(1); and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0989">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 313</span>
fourthly and lastly that there was a defect in the service of the notice. All these grounds should have been fully explored in the processes of appeal, and to allow them to be reopened would be to open the door to a great deal of time wasting and unproductive legal arguments.<br><br>
I am quite willing to have a look at paragraph 37 of Schedule 8 on this point to see whether in fact by that wording we achieve what we are trying to set out in Clause 16(8). I accept that there must be no possible ambiguity and that we must make clear the intentions of Parliament in this regard, and I would willingly discuss that when we come to it. I hope the hon. and learned Gentleman will not now debate paragraph 37 with me, because I am willing to look at that again. I hope the hon. and learned Gentleman will find this explanation acceptable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are grateful to the Minister for that very careful reply. May I say that I would not dream of starting to discuss paragraph 37 of the Schedule because it is far too complicated to take it in at one burst, as it were. But Clause 18 appears to relate the appeals against refusal of established use certificates. In subsection (5) it invokes the provisions of Section 31 of the Act of 1959. It may be that there is a weighty explanation as to why, in the one case, it is deemed necessary and advisable to do that, and, in the other case, to rely on the provisions of the Schedule. If the Minister can help us in that regard we shall be grateful; if not, perhaps we might discuss it at some later stage.</span></p>
<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. and learned Gentleman for moving this Amendment and I am glad that he is not contesting the principle of my reply. I acknowledge that we will have to look carefully at Clause 18(5). I am not quite certain whether we need it, and should we reach it this morning I hope the Committee will forgive me if I ask for its inclusion on the grounds of caution rather than make a quick judgment now as a result of our debate on Clause 16(8). We must both look carefully at aparagraph 37 to achieve this, but I understand the hon. and learned Gentleman is not contesting this limitation, which is sensible, in that it avoids repetition and unnecesary argu-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 314</span>
ment in the courts while protecting the right of the individual to take the matter to the courts in certain definite circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Wylie?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Well, Sir Barnett, if you are inviting me to say something—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I am not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>:—I do not contest the proposition that enforcement notices and that field of dispute are really more appropriate to the Secretary of State in an administrative capacity than the sheriff, as was provided in Section 21 of the 1947 Act. There was there an appeal from the sheriff in circumstances to the Court of Session. But one has to be careful about precluding an appeal—if we are doing so, by omitting a reference of this kind, though I am not sure we are—to the sheriff court purely on the question of law; that is, the question of whether or not the actings complained of have been <i>ultra vires</i> actings. Section 31 directs its attention to the person who is aggrieved by an order and desires to question the validity of the order on the ground that it is not within the powers of the Act, or that the relevant requirements have not been complied with. But where one is dealing with what is purely a question of law like that we need to be careful about excluding the jurisdiction of the Court of Session. I am not sure that we should be doing so by not having a reference to Section 31 of the 1959 Act. This, however, is obviously a complicated matter and not one on which we should take up the time of the Committee. I should be grateful if the Minister would write to me at a later stage letting me have his considered views on it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Question is——</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Oh, I forgot. I meant to withdraw. In these circumstances I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would explain to the hon. and learned Gentleman that I was not inviting him to speak but awaiting the intimation he gave at the end.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would ask the Minister to answer my question and say whether he sees this as a method which could be used to take a local planning matter on appeal to the Secretary of State through a relatively back-door use of the enforcement order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think so. That is a little Machiavellian and so uncharacteristic of the hon. Gentleman, but in view of his remark I will see if it would be possible for some abuse to take place.<br><br>
Incidentally, on the question raised by the hon. and learned Gentleman, I will certainly give a great deal more thought to the whole of the Clause, and Clause 18(5) and to his reference to paragraph 37 of Schedule 8, and will try to write to him before Report stage so that he can have the full benefit of what we have thought.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of the fact that there appears to be a very friendly discussion taking place at the other end of the Room, I wonder if my hon.

<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
CERTIFICATION OF ESTABLISHED USE</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I propose, subject to the approval of the Committee, to take, with Amendment No. 25, Amendments 26 to 30 inclusive, and to put them to the Committee together, later.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 25, in page 18, line 33, leave out '1964' and insert '1965 '.<br><br>
The five succeeding Amendments rest on the first and are consequential on it. The effect of this Amendment would be to bring the dates in Clause 17(1) relating to certificates of established use into line with those Clause 15(1) and 16(1)(d) in relation to enforcement notices.<br><br>
Under Clause 15, enforcement action is possible at any time after the date of a breach after the end of 1964 provided
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 316</span>
the breach is not of a kind specified in subsection (3) which is subject only to enforcement action within four years of the date of the breach. I agree that this is a change from the existing state of affairs in Scotland under which enforcement action must be taken within two years of the alleged breach coming to the notice of the planning authority. The effect of the change is to expose the majority of irregular development to enforcement action at any time in the future. This creates a need for means by which owners can clear up doubts about the planning position. To meet this need Clause 17 provides that an established use certificate may be granted for a development in breach of planning control provided that the development was carried out before the beginning of 1964.<br><br>
The effect of these Amendments is to bring the date forward to 1965. This ensures consistency with the dates relative to enforcement and is also a more generous provision, enabling a larger number of people to apply for an established use certificate. I believe these Amendments are acceptable to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These Amendments are so obviously desirable that I was under the impression that the dates in the Clause as printed were simply printer's errors. Certainly, they are Amendments which the Committee would wish to see carried.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Further Amendments made:</i> No. 26, in page 18, line 35, leave out '1963' and insert '1964'; No. 27, in line 36, leave out '1964' and insert '1965'; No. 28, in line 40, leave out '1963' and insert '1964'; No. 29, in line 41, leave out '1963' and insert '1964'; No. 30, in line 43, leave out '1963' and insert '1964'—[<i>Dr. Dickson Mabon.</i>]</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 96, in page 19, line 10, at end insert:
<br><blockquote><p>'provided the current use does not conflict with an approved structure plan'.</p></blockquote>
Its purpose is simply to ensure that grant of an established use certificate would not leave land indefinitely open to a use or purpose against the national interest. I will be easily satisfied on this. I would ask the Minister whether, where land is being misused or where its use conflicts with an approved structure plan,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0991">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 317</span>
the fact that its use was established before the specified dates entitle it to an established use certificate or whether this is entirely at the discretion of the local planning authority. If, for example, land which was zoned in a plan for afforestation is at the present time being used for grouse shooting or extensive grazing, does the fact that it may have been used for either of those purposes for half a century or more preclude the local planning authority from denying it an established use certificate? In other words if a certificate is granted, does the appeal work both ways? If a certificate is refused, the person applying for it can appeal against the refusal. Equally, if an established use certificate is granted, can a member of the public appeal against the granting of the certificate?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a difficult matter. I quite agree with the hon. Gentleman about the effect of this Amendment. It would be to limit the grant of an established use certificate to cases in which the development in question, notwithstanding lack of planning permission, did not conflict with an approved structure plan. The object, presumably, is to keep open the possibility of enforcement against development which does not have planning permission if it offends against the zoning shown in the plan. The hon. Gentleman spoke of the national interest. This would not be appropriate. An established use certificate embodies a statement of fact about the development in question, namely, that the development has been in existence since before the beginning of 1965. The object is to avoid taking immunity from enforcement away from developments which have already gained it by tholing their assize, and this is done by providing them with a certificate which can be used at any time in the future to prove that they had gained immunity.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend raise his voice a little as we cannot hear him when he mutters down at the desk.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry my voice should be so soft and quiet, though that is the first time I have been told that it is. I am flattered.<br><br>
It would be unfair to discriminate against developments which conflicted with zoning. Small conflicting develop-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 318</span>
ments are often perfectly acceptable. The very fact that a development has gone unchallenged for four years may suggest that it must be fairly acceptable to the community. This does not mean that because of the established use certificate, local planning authorities will have to put up with developments which are contrary to good planning, for that would not be right. What it does mean is that if they want to get rid of a development which has been established since before the beginning of 1965 and which they have not challenged hitherto, they will have to do so by means of a discontinuance order, just as they would have to do with development which was not contrary to planning control.<br><br>
If the hon. Gentleman is raising the point that this is an error of omission or indicates lack of attention by the authority and ought to be changed because of the new circumstances, or circumstances which should have been more clearly emphasised in the past, then the right course is to promote a discontinuance order as it would have to do with any development which was not contrary to planning control. I believe that that is the best way of meeting the point, rather than accepting the hon. Gentleman's Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. J. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for his reply but I am not entirely satisfied on two points. He did not answer my question as to whether an appeal against the granting of an established use certificate works only one way. I take it that it does, that it works only in the case of someone who has applied for and has not been granted a certificate, who can then appeal against that decision; but that if one is granted it is not possible for a member of the public to appeal against that grant of certificate. Could I have the Minister's assurance that in the case of an application for an established use certificate, where this conflicts with an approved structure plan or does not appear to be in the public or national interest, he would expect the local planning authority in those circumstances to refuse the grant of certificate so that it would follow in due course that the final decision would rest with the Secretary of State? If the Minister can satisfy me on those two points, then I shall be perfectly happy to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>

<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'> I confirm that. I am sorry that I did not make that clear, but the hon. Gentleman has himself made it clear. The party who is interested appeals against the refusal to grant a certificate, and, if any member of the public feels that the local authority is quite right in refusing, then he would support the local authority, either directly by writing to the county clerk or the town clerk, or would make his position clear to a local councillor so that he in his turn could make it clear. So that this would be part of the argument in the appeal in support of the planning authority's refusal of a certificate.<br><br>
But I would point out that the certificate is, after all, a recording of a statement of fact about the development in question; namely, that the development has been in existence since before the beginning of 1965. Whether or not it has been in existence "by default of the local authority" is another matter, and if it has the local authority can hardly complain, because it could have taken action earlier if it had wanted.<br><br>
If there is a situation like this, which we may regret, the remedy is not to oppose the certificate, because one is then challenging fact, and challenging fact without having any factual rebuttal of it, since it is a fact that the development has been in existence since the beginning of 1965. That is a fact which no one can challenge. But if the point is that in policy terms this ought not to be so, then the proper procedure for a private person who feels that something is against the local community interest is to urge the local council to promote a discontinuance order, or, if the gentleman concerned is a Member of Parliament who is looking at the matter in the interests of the community and not merely in the interests of a neighbour or something like that, he can persuade the local authority to make a discontinuance order, just as it would have to do with development which was not contrary to planning control.<br><br>
That is the right way of doing it, and I do not see any other way of doing it without appearing to be somewhat invidious in acting against the person concerned. The hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie),
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 320</span>
who has been so helpful in these later stages of the Bill, might like to suggest to me a situation where this would not be the right course, although I doubt whether he could. I think that the right way of unwinding something if it is wrong as it stands, is to pursue the matter through a discontinuance order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This established use certificate is merely a statement of fact. It is not a grant of planning consent. It is merely recognising the fact that a certain use has been going on during the period specified. So that it is difficult to envisage a circumstance in which someone would want to object to an established use certificate and proceed on the basis of a continuing use over a period of three years about which he did not already know. It is difficult to visualise a situation in which, either he knew about it, n which case he could take the necessary proceedings to have it discontinued, or he did not know about it, in which case it could not have been all that bad. If it is a use that is so offensive that he would object to an established use certificate, then it is difficult to see him not knowing about it. Can the Minister give me a reference to the discontinuance order provisions? I imagine that it will be under the 1947 Act.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. It is Section 24 of the 1947 Act.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank both the Minister and the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie), for the information that they have disclosed on this matter. May I take it, then, if a situation arises where an established use certificate is applied for, and there are feelings by the public—they may not have been articulate before—that something is not an established use which should continue, that nevertheless the local planning authority will feel morally obliged, provided that the use had been established before the specified date, to grant the certificate because the use was established, knowing perfectly well that if it refuses to grant it, and there is an appeal, the Secretary of State will be bound to uphold the appeal, since the use of the land is a matter of fact and not of preference? Therefore, the only method in such a case is for the local planning authority

POWER TO STOP FURTHER DEVELOPMENT PENDING PROCEEDINGS ON ENFORCEMENT NOTICE</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 131, in page 21, line 16, leave out from 'control' to end of line 17.<br><br>
This Clause relates to stop notices and the power to stop further development pending proceedings on enforcement notices. The Committee will note that in subsection (5) there is quite a material penalty provision. The opening provision in subsection (1) provides that after the local planning authority has served an enforcement notice it may serve a further notice stopping the proceedings alleged to be contrary to planning approval, and that is defined as
<br><blockquote><p>"being operations either allelged in the enforcement notice to constitute a breach of planning control or so closely associated therewith as to constitute substantially the same operations."</p></blockquote>
Is not the position either that the operations complained of in the enforcement
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 322</span>
notice constitute a breach of planning control, or that they do not? If they do not, then that is, of course, a complete defence to the notice under Clause 16(1)(<i>b</i>). But if they do, then equally the position is clear.<br><br>
When one is introducing provisions in the nature of quasi-penal provisions, and, indeed, introducing penalty clauses, the matter should be clarified in the simplest and most clear-cut terms possible. This subsection should simply provide that the basis of the stop notice is that the operations complained of in the enforcement notice constitute a breach of planning control and to add these words,
<br><blockquote><p>"or so closely associated therewith as to constitute substantially the same operations"</p></blockquote>
is introducing a degree of flexibility which one does not like to see in statutory provisions of this nature.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman's intention is quite clear. It is to strike out the second half of the definition. My purpose is to defend the second half of the definition, on the grounds that we need some elbow room here. It is not unknown for parties upon whom a stop notice is served in these circumstances—I can envisage it, anyway—to be only too ready to grab at almost any excuse to question its validity. It may be the case—and one must have regard to the compensation liability in Clause 20—that a stop notice, not necessarily served immediately upon the serving of the enforcement notice, might not be effective or might be subject to argument, because the enforcement notice in which was given a description of the operations was not, in fact, describing those operations as they had gone to a further stage. Therefore, it could be argued that the description was invalid. It is because of the possibility of legal arguments which would be quibbles—and I do not mean that in any offensive way—about the meaning of the notice, that we have put in the second part of the definition. It is to give elbow room for the authorities so that we can make a stop notice enforceable, and not simply a matter for further argument on the grounds that the operations described did not correspond to the operations in their current state. I do not see any way of avoiding some form of the second half of this definition, because the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0994">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 323</span>
law could be circumvented in a damaging minority of cases.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not too happy about this. The stop notice follows and proceeds on an enforcement notice. It is really a further proceeding. The enforcement notice dealt with in Clause 15 (5) has to specify the matters alleged to constitute a breach of planning control, so we start off with an allegation by the planning authority that there has been a breach of planning control in a certain respect. That respect is specified in the enforcement notice, and it is right that it should be specified because of the consequences that can follow from a continuing breach.<br><br>
What the hon. Gentleman is saying is that, notwithstanding that there is an allegation of a breach of planning control in the enforcement notice which is picked up in the stop notice, there may be some change in the meantime in the operations which it would also be desirable to incorporate in the stop notice.<br><br>
One wants to see flexibility in planning control, but here we are, in effect, introducing penal provisions, because subsection (5) of this Clause provides that:
<br><blockquote><p>"If while a stop notice has effect in relation to him a person carries out, or causes or permits to be carried out, any operations prohibited by "the notice, he shall be guilty of an offence."</p></blockquote>
If that is the case, then it seems to me that it is more equitable, and will be perfectly adequate in the vast majority of cases, for the stop notice to proceed on the basis of the complaint set out in the enforcement notice. After all, this is really a follow up on the enforcement notice, and elbow room in this kind of field is not really very desirable. I do not wish to press this, but will the hon. Gentleman consider——</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to think of a case where these words would be necessary. If a planning authority became aware that a certain piece of land had been bought for the dumping of rubbish, and that although the breach had not taken place there was an intention to do it, would that elbow room not then be rather valuable in order to avoid the actual dumping?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A stop notice follows on an enforcement notice, and the enforce-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 324</span>
ment notice can only be operated where there has been a breach. The dumping would have to be going on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is how it appears to me, but I wonder whether these words which the hon. and learned Gentleman wants to remove could help in a case such as that. I appreciate that the enforcement notice must be served on the breach, and that is a difficulty. There is a weakness here, because a local authority ought not to allow a breach to occur if it can take steps to avoid it.</span></p>
<p>12 noon.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Certainly that is so. What I think the Minister is concerned about here is where there is an allegation that there has been a breach, contained in an enforcement notice and that in some devious way the breach complained of in the enforcement notice is being got round by a minor variant of the operation being complained of which, he thinks, might not be caught by the stop notice. It is difficult to visualise circumstances in which there can be a variation in the activities between the enforcement notice and the stop notice which would require the stop notice to be broadened in this way so as to catch not what was originally being done but the variant that is now being done. I would suggest that where we have penal provisions—after all, the stop notice, if it is disregarded, is going to be followed by penalties—we ought to specify clearly the basis of the enforcement notice and what constitutes a breach of the stop notice which follows the enforcement notice. If we introduce words that the activities may be so closely associated with what is complained of in the enforcement notice as to constitute substantially the same operations we are getting into a difficult field in which flexibility helps the planning authority and planning control but cuts across basic provisions that a person must be given the opportunity to know when he is breaking an Act of Parliament or committing an offence. Although I can see the argument from the planning control point of view, I would suggest that, on balance, it is more than outweighed by the inroads made into the rights of the individual. It would seem to me that the benefit of the doubt must go to the individual.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. W. H. K. Baker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I find myself a little confused by the discussion on this
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0995">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 325</span>
Amendment. I consulted my local authority about this Clause and it brought to my notice a particular case—I do not wish to give full details of it—where planning permission had been given and an enforcement order made under certain conditions. The building went on; the building was absolutely in order; but the contractor used a colour scheme very different from that which had been envisaged in the original planning permission. Whether or not—and this I am not clear about—the colour had been specified, I do not know, but in any event the colour was quite wrong. I am just wondering what the position would be if my hon. and learned Friend's Amendment were accepted, or if the Bill stayed as it is.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would not like to answer such a question without having more details of the circumstances. I might attempt to answer it, and to some extent answer the hon. and learned Gentleman, by pointing out the difference between us on this matter. One is a question of time and the other is a question of the nature of the variant.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Gentleman said that as far as time was concerned the stop notice would come immediately after the enforcement notice. That, of course, would not necessarily be true. The stop notice would be issued because certain contravening operations were continuing. They might be very minor, but that is not the point. The point is not the nature of the variant. It is the fact that the stop notice is coming on after a distance of time. To that extent the terms of the enforcement notice may have been made invalid even in a minor way, and on the basis of their being invalid in a minor way there comes the question of time.<br><br>
The second argument is about the variant. A local authority is not, in the light of what we read in Clause 20, going to use a stop notice unless it has substantial reasons for so doing. If it does so recklessly, or by a misjudgment, and it turns out that it has been in the wrong, the developer, under Clause 20, will receive full compensation. I do not see local authorities rushing in with stop notices unless they are sure that it is in the public interest and that they are right.<br><br>
Because of the fact that the stop notice and the enforcement notice do not come
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 326</span>
together there is a time lag, and something could happen in the time lag. It could be beyond the enforcement notice. The enforcement notice could have said that a house will not be built nor will a garage, and a garage is being built despite the enforcement notice, and the stop notice comes in, but the house may be built. That is a somewhat extravagant example and it is hardly a variant; it would be a serious breach. Colour may not be a minor matter; it could be a critical matter particularly in rural areas such as in Banff. It depends on what one regards as minor or major.<br><br>
This is what we are leaving to the discretion of the local authorities. If they make a noise wrongly and recklessly they will have to pay the price, and the local ratepayer will complain at the lack of judgment of his local councillors. The importance of the second part of the definition is to leave it open so that judgment is exercised as to what is minor or major and to what extent the continuing operations have contravened the original intention of the enforcement notice. I am saying that the enforcement notice could be out of date by virtue of the very offence the stop notice is protesting against. That is why we must leave a form of words, as in the second part of the definition, to cover us, so that we do not get the argument that, technically, the developer is not wrong. That is rewarding a guilt instead of redressing what has been an offence in the first instance.<br><br>
I am willing to hear from the hon. and learned Gentleman either now or by letter a form of words we could put in for the second part of the definition. I will listen to a revised version, but it would be quite wrong to leave out the definition in its form here. I expect now that we have had the second attempt at it the hon. and learned Gentleman might agree with me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will read with care what the Minister has said. I just do not understand the argument that the notice could be out of date superseded by events. The stop notice is something which follows on the enforcement notice. It would not in the ordinary way follow immediately. It is an interdict proceeding with penal consequences to stop people doing something which they have already been told constitutes a breach of planning control.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0996">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 327</span>
Going back to the enforcement notice at Clause 15(5), the notice has to specify three things:
<br><blockquote><p>"the matters alleged to constitute a breach of planning control;"</p></blockquote>
secondly,
<br><blockquote><p>"the steps required 'by the authority to be taken in order to remedy the breach, that is to say steps for the purpose of restoring the land to its condition before the development took place …"</p></blockquote>
In the circumstances my hon. Friend gave, it was colour which contravened one of the conditions attached to the planning consent. The enforcement notice would say that the colour being used is a breach of a material condition in the planning consent, and the colour has to be changed. Thirdly, the period is given in which to comply. Here would be clearly laid out what had gone wrong, what had to be done and the time in which to act.<br><br>
The stop notice comes along. What is going to happen if a positive condition, a mandatory provision, is not being complied with? We are dealing with a case where a person is doing something contrary to planning consent, and carrying on doing it. The stop notice comes along and says that the person must stop doing the thing which constitutes a breach of planning control on which the enforcement notice proceeds. We have no complaint about that. That is a breach of the enforcement notice and should be penalised.<br><br>
This is where I jib at the wording of the Clause. We accept that there should be the stop notice procedure. We accept that if there is a breach of the stop notice there should be a penalty. But it should be clearly specified what constitutes the offence, the operations specified in the enforcement notice, but not operations
<br><blockquote><p>"so closely associated therewith as to constitute substantially the same operations."</p></blockquote>
Either the difference is so minimal as to make no difference and the <i>de minimis</i> rule would apply, or it is a matter of substance for the local authority to decide whether it constitutes the same operation or not. I do not think this kind of discretion in a quasi-penal thing is justified.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is this a system of an injunction to be made by the Secretary of State and not by a court of law?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 328</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I used the Scottish term "interdict". "Injunction" is the English expression.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not contrary to Parliamentary rules yet.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend asked if this is an injunction. It is an injunction. I used the world "interdict" and I used it before. It is imposed by the local authority and like any interdict a breach of the interdict involves penalties. If it is an interdict imposed by the court it is contempt of court to be in breach of the interdict. To be in breach of the stop notice involves penalties.<br><br>
In that case it seems to us that there must be clarity as to what constitutes a breach of the stop notice, and one does not like in that context to introduce a variant such as proceedings and operations
<br><blockquote><p>"so closely associated therewith as to constitute substantially the same operations."</p></blockquote>
Who is going to decide whether an offence has been constituted here? There must be clarity, and the difference referred to in the closing words of the subsection are so minimal as to make no difference at all. If there is a wider gap we should go on and think about it.</span></p>
<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have been trying to think about the need for the words which the Amendment would abolish. I want the hon. and learned Member for Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) to envisage that planning consent has been given for a building and that within that planning consent there has been provision for the disposal of an effluent, but once operations start—and this is the sort of variant which I feel might appeal to the hon. and learned Member—this effluent is obnoxious and has not been treated to comply with what has been laid down and has been delivered into a nearby river causing damage to trout life. Is there not a case where we should have an enforcement notice? We should preserve fish life and apply a stop notice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a good example. If planning permission is granted subject to an effluent being treated in a certain way and the effluent is not treated in that certain way, that is a breach of the conditions, and one would proceed with an enforcement notice. This would say,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0997">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 329</span>
"This is what you are doing wrong. You must treat this effluent properly under the terms of your conditions and comply with this order in so many weeks or days". If he then carries on doing it, one follows up with a stop notice. But the stop notice refers to the enforcement notice. It says, "Stop this right away. You know that you are doing wrong."—There is no ambiguity about it—"If you carry on in breach of this you are committing an offence." That seems a thoroughly good practice.<br><br>
But one may not be doing the thing referred to in the enforcement notice but something else very close to it. One cannot get to that without introducing the question of how close one can be, and I think that is better left out. We have had an interesting discussion. I will look at this and I will write to the Minister of State in due course.<br><br>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 132, in page 21, line 18, leave out subsection (2).<br><br>
Subsection (2) provides:
<br><blockquote><p>"The operations which may be the subject of a stop notice shall include the deposit of refuse or waste materials on land where that is a breach of planning control alleged in the enforcement notice."</p></blockquote>
If that is a breach of planning control and it is alleged in the enforcement notice to be a breach of planning control, and the stop notice proceeds on the basis of the enforcement notice, what is the necessity of spelling this out in a separate subsection?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The equivalent provision in the 1947 Act, which it is always useful to look at, because we can judge how it has operated over twenty years or so, is Section 10 which declares clearly that for the avoidance of doubt the deposit of refuse or waste materials involves a material change of use "if the superficial area or the height of the deposit is thereby extended". But it provides that planning permission shall not be required if the height of the deposit does not exceed the level of the land adjoining the site and the superficial area of the deposit is not thereby extended. This somewhat complex provision, which is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 330</span>
intended to give a reasonable degree of freedom for dumping grounds, without the necessity of planning permission, inevitably leaves room for argument about whether planning permission is required in a particular case or not.<br><br>
It may often happen that, when an enforcement notice is served, the developer responds by denying that what he is doing requires planning permission. It would then be necessary to embark upon the process of determining whether planning permission was needed, a process which, in the nature of things, may occupy a considerable time, during which these operations are likely to continue.<br><br>
I come back to the argument of time. The effect of subsection (2) is to enable a stop notice to take effect simply on the basis of the allegation of a breach of planning control. The stop notice thus comes into force and prevents the alleged breach from being made worse while the question of determining whether planning permission is needed is threshed out, and that would be a good idea, considering all that has happened in the past.<br><br>
There is no reason to fear that this places an arbitrary power in the hands of the local authorities or that they will abuse this. The compensation provisions are in Clause 20 and they will ensure that they do not serve a stop notice unless they have substantial reasons for so doing, because if it turns out that they are wrong the developer will receive full compensation.<br><br>
I think I have a cast-iron case for resisting this Amendment, because we are not going into whether there is planning permission, but a stop notice is used to stop what is happening till it is clear whether planning permission has been agreed or not. A nuisance, if it is a nuisance, will be stopped while the argument is settled. If it is settled in favour of the developer he will carry on his activities and get compensation for whatever loss there has been in the interval, and if the decision is in favour of the local authority the developer will not have made the situation worse by going on during the debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dempsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend help me? Could he say if this procedure applies to the National Coal Board which is dumping workings?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0998">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 331</span>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would say that waste material of any kind whether from mineral workings or not, is still waste material.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, the Minister is saying that, although it is alleged in the enforcement notice that this operation constitutes a breach of planning control, and the stop notice proceeds on that basis, where we are dealing with the dumping of waste material or refuse we are in a realm where there may be uncertainty whether there has been a breach of planning control or not. That seems to be the basis of the Minister's argument.<br><br>
If there is a dispute between the parties on whether or not planning permission is required—therefore, whether or not planning permission has been breached—that is the kind of issue which can and would be raised in an argument in an enforcement notice, but so long as the enforcement notice were <i>sub judice</i> it would be possible to proceed with a stop notice and, as the Minister pointed out before, the stop notice can be used, and if at the end of the day the enforcement notice lacks validity there will be compensation proceedings under the later Clause. As in all interdict proceedings—and this amounts to an interim interdict—if the interdict is granted and the basis on which it was obtained is proved fallacious the person suffering loss as a result of the interdict is entitled to compensation from the person at whose instance it was obtained.<br><br>
So, recognising there is this provision in Section 10 of the 1947 Act which deals with what requires planning permission, while one recognises that there is a proviso in this that the deposit of refuse or waste material may not amount to something which requires planning permission, I would not have thought that more unusual than the other circumstances in which an enforcement notice can be disputed. The operation of an enforcement notice is in dispute. It could be said that the operation did not stop the local authority from using a stop notice in the meantime, and I do not see the necessity for subsection (2) at all. I think it is covered by subsection (1), and I do not feel like withdrawing the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not see how the hon. and learned Gentleman for Edin-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 332</span>
burgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) can miss the argument on this. I can see how he does not accept the argument about the finishing of a shop or the painting of a building or building a garage being an addition to the alleged offence, but here is something where, for instance, Wylie and Mabon are dumping waste material on a certain piece of ground in the county of <i>x</i> and it is alleged by that authority that we are in breach of planning permission and an enforcement notice is served. But Wylie and Mabon continue to dump material and a stop notice is served. I do not see how the hon. and learned Member can object.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is using, not just the theory but the practice of Section 10 of which hon. Members know, regarding the dumping of waste material. This has been an uncertain area. All we are saying is that this puts it beyond doubt that a stop notice says "Stop" simply on the basis of the allegation and not on the basis that they may or may not have planning permission as they aver they have planning permission to dump up to a certain level. It is desirable to put the issue beyond doubt. The local authorities would be disappointed if this subsection were not left as it is.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am prepared to accept the argument that this is to leave it beyond doubt, but if every stop notice is to proceed on the basis of the allegation in the enforcement notice and Wylie and Mabon are said to be in breach of planning and of an enforcement notice and a stop notice is served I still do not see the necessity for this subsection. It is to proceed on the basis of allegation. It may turn out that because of Section 10 we are not in breach of planning control because what we are doing does not require permission, but that will be resolved at the end of the day, and in the meantime the stop notice proceeds on the basis of that there has been an alleged breach of planning control.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. A. Woodburn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are all grateful to my hon. Friend the Minister of State and to the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) for their detailed explanation, but after that long explanation the hon. and learned Member comes to the conclusion that he does not think the subsection is necessary.

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 333</span>
But he may be wrong. It may be necessary. The hon. and learned Gentleman has not explained that it will do any harm if it is in, and it seems to be a long argument just to convince us that he thinks it is unnecessary. If he is wrong, there might be trouble for local authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister can convince me I shall willingly withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In my view, this is an example of the hon. and learned Gentleman wanting to maintain a position where nobody understands it at all, which, of course, is very nice for the lawyers, but is as much as these words make it clear how we stand and so avoid the employment of lawyers I should have thought them desirable. I do not know what we are arguing about. I had hoped that we might have a word or two from my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Oswald) because it is his birthday today, and I thought he might have celebrated the occasion by making a speech in the Committee. However, as he has not done so I will still extend my very good wishes to him. I hope the hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie), who, like me, at one time contested Edinburgh, Central, will now withdraw his Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In celebration of May Day!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would readily join in the congratulations to the hon. Gentleman but I am not sure what connection this has with the discussion about the need for depositing refuse or waste materials on sites. I do not think these words do any harm, and if the Minister thinks it is better to have them in then by all means let us do so, and we can negative my Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dempsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I ask whether there is any hope of making the legislation retrospective so that we can get rid of some foul and obnoxious things?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The answer to that question, unfortunately, is, No. We shall have to get this legislation, I hope, very soon, so that local authorities may act upon it.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 334</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 133, in page 21, line 23, leave out "to have an interest in the land or".<br><br>
Subsection (3) reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"A stop notice may be served by the local planning authority on any person who appears to them to have an interest in the land or to be concerned with the carrying out or continuance of any operations thereon."</p></blockquote>
This is really a probing Amendment, but it is difficult to see how these words, "to have an interest in the land ", are necessary, because if the stop notice proceeds on the basis of and, indeed, in furtherance of, an enforcement notice, we know from earlier provisions that the enforcement notice is served on certain persons such as the owner, lessee, or any other person with an interest in the land. The stop notice follows on the enforcement notice and presumably would be served on the same parties. Therefore I am not quite clear what other persons with an interest in the land would be served with the stop notice who have not already been served with the enforcement notice and to whom, of necessity, the stop notice will go. One can see the need to introduce additional provisions in connection with the service of the stop notice on persons carrying on operations on land—presumably, contractors or agents—but so far as the service of the person with an interest in the land is concerned, it seems hardly necessary to spell that out in this subsection.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the hon. and learned Gentleman's words when he says this is a probing Amendment. At first I thought it was rather strange that the Opposition wanted this limitation, but now I see that is not the case. It is simply a question of wanting an explanation.<br><br>
The essence of the stop notice procedure is that it will be quick and flexible and that notice should be served on the right person, that is to say the person who will stop what is happening. It is right and proper that the enforcement notice, which precedes the stop notice, must be served on the owner, occupier, lessee and any other person having an interest in the land. When the hon. and learned Gentleman mentioned contractors, developers, and so on, he is quite right in that they may not be the initiators but they are the executors of what is alleged to be the offence, and the essence is for the authority to get the right person who is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1000">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 335</span>
actually doing the damage. Naturally they could notify others, but it would be quite wrong of them simply to notify the wrong people.<br><br>
That is the reason why we oppose this Amendment. I agree that there does not seem to be any reason why the local planning authority should not be allowed to serve a notice on persons having an interest in the land if it seems that such persons ought to be informed at the earliest possible moment of the service of the notices. The notice must be expeditious and it must be upon the contractor or whoever is causing the offence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That would still apply. I said that we recognise the need to deal with the contractor, because he is not the person having the interest in the land.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would add this. Sometimes, at the moment, when the notice is to be served, it may be doubtful which of the parties is making the running. It is conceivable that by stopping the contractor one would achieve the object, but on the other hand it is also possible that the contractor would ignore the notice and proceed on the instructions of those having an interest in the land. That could include a host of different people, such as a building society. After all, this is a permissive clause. It is right that the authority should decide on whom it should serve the notices, and the service should be done quickly and effectively.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The whole argument in regard to the contractor and the person carrying on the operation is a complete red herring, because this Amendment does not prevent the local authority from serving the notice on that category of persons, for the obvious reason that there must be power for the local authority to serve on that category of person if there is to be effective control. If they disobey the stop notice they will be guilty of an offence under subsection (5) and will be penalised for it. Who are the persons having an interest in the land if they are not the persons already referred to in the preceding provisions with regard to the service of an enforcement notice?<br><br>
All we are saying is that if we have to serve an enforcement notice on persons
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 336</span>
with an interest in the land and thereafter we proceed with the stop notice, what is the point of referring again to serving a stop notice on persons having an interest in the land? It is already covered. However, if the Minister feels he will be happier with these words in the subsection I would not wish to deprive him of them, and therefore I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 136, in page 22, line 20, leave out "of this subsection".<br><br>
I am not quite sure what these words mean. Subsection (8) deals with the situation where a contractor is involved, and it provides that where the contractor is under contract to a developer to carry out certain operations on land, and the stop notice takes effect prohibiting them, and the operations are discontinued by the contractor accordingly, in that way he complies with the stop notice provisions. Then the subsection reads
<br><blockquote><p>"unless and in so far as the contract makes provision explicitly to the contrary of this subsection, the developer shall be under the same liability in contract as if the operations had been countermanded or discontinued on instructions given by him".</p></blockquote>
I am not sure what these words add. I would have thought that it would be much clearer if it simply read
<br><blockquote><p>"unless and in so far as the contract makes provision explicitly to the contrary, the developer shall be under the same liability in contract."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that this is a small point. In the last debate it was quite possible that the developer who had an interest in the land could have instructed another contractor to go in and do the work while the first contractor had been given a stop notice and had ceased his operations. Perhaps the hon. and learned Gentleman may have forgotten that circumstance. We are now discussing what happens to the poor contractor who has obeyed the stop notice. I accept that there is not much of an argument here.<br><br>
This Amendment occurs in subsection (8) which safeguards the position of the contractor in a case where a stop notice has taken effect and building operations have, therefore, to be stopped, by providing that the developer shall be regarded as in breach of contract, unless
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1001">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 337</span>
the contract explicitly provides to the contrary. Is this not a convenient shorthand method of referring to the provisions of the subsection in any contract where the parties wish to provide explicitly to the contrary? If the hon. and learned Gentleman does not agree it means that if we take the words out the provisions of the contract would have to spell out at length and in detail what I think it would be desirable to avoid. Perhaps as a lawyer it might appeal to him. I am not thirled to these words, but if I take them out and we get complaints then the hon. and learned Gentleman must take the brunt. It is a type of shorthand reference that I would like to leave in.</span></p>
<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised at my hon. Friend's reference to lawyers as if they write words which are clear, for that is precisely what they do not write. Once again we have had some brilliant expositions from my hon. Friend this morning. He really has succeeded in making difficult legal matters very clear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to know exactly what is meant by the words
<br><blockquote><p>"unless and in so far as the contract makes provision explicitly to the contrary of this subsection the developer shall be under the same liability …"</p></blockquote>
That draws attention to the proposals but precisely the same result would be achieved by the words
<br><blockquote><p>"unless the contractor makes provision explicitly to the contrary the developer shall be liable".</p></blockquote>
In the contract there has to be either a specific reference to this subsection or reference to it by implication; and the exclusion of liability to the developer will be based on what is said in the contract. Accordingly, it seems to me that the words "of this subsection" are quite unnecessary, and they do not make the passage at all easy to read. It would be simpler to say,
<br><blockquote><p>"except and in so far as the contract makes provision explicitly to the contrary, the developer shall be under the same liability".</p></blockquote>
However, if the Minister needs these words, even though it is not a particularly neat or tidy way of doing it, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 338</span>
<p><i>Amendment made:</i> No. 31, in page 22, line 24, leave out 'on or'.—[<i>Dr. Dickson Mabon.</i>]</p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, this is to be welcomed because it lays down clearly the procedure for stopping further development when it is in breach of planning permission. There is another desirable feature in that the procedures are utterly clear, so that when a development has to be stopped it can be stopped, as the Minister has said, quickly and with certainty. Thereby, a development which is undesirable and is in breach of procedure cannot go on and on to a stage where there can be argument that it has gone so far that it cannot be put back—something which is often said. This provision should be effective because, obviously, anybody who has had this kind of stop notice served on him will sit up and take notice, because presumably it will have on it something drawing attention to the fines and penalties involved.<br><br>
I wish to raise one or two practical points, though I hesitate to do so after the high level of legal argument which we have had this morning. Although that may delight the palate of the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis), some of us in the Committee are very interested in the practical issues, as well. To bring it down to a practical level, we have had discussion as to Whether the stop notice should be served on the contractor or developer. To take it a stage further, in practice on whom will the notice be served? Will it be served on the foreman on the site or on a workman digging in a trench who may be the only person on the site on that particular day? Copies of the notice, presumably, will be served on the firm carrying out the operations—on the head office or the manager, the person to whom planning permission has been given. But to make sure that a stop is made at once, which is the purpose of this Clause, we should like to know in practical terms on whom the notice is to be served.<br><br>
Secondly, does the Minister envisage that there will be a prescribed form of stop notice? Under whose authority, and over whose signature, will it be issued?
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1002">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 339</span>
These are important points, because if this procedure is to be effective the notice should be in some recognised form. We know that the provision specifies what the stop notice should contain, and that a copy of the enforcement notice has to be taken with it, but it would help to know what discussions the Minister of State has had with local authorities, and whether it is envisaged that a definite and prescribed form of notice is to be used, readily understandable and perfectly clear in meaning, particularly as it may be served on an ordinary workman on the site.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had some tremendous examples of blood letting or haemorrhaging and stabs in the front. I give credit for that to the party opposite. First of all, we had Julius Caesar, representing Dumfries, struck down for not knowing proper legal jargon. Now Brutus has been struck by Cassius for his comment that legalisms are not necessarily practical.<br><br>
I will try to answer the practical points. First, on whom is the stop notice to be served? The answer is, on the persons who, in the judgment of the local authority, will be able to stop the proceedings. Where the local authority wants to extend that to other persons we have left the phrasing of the Clause in such a form that the authority can select almost anyone it believes to be either concerned in the operations or having an interest in the land in one way or another. It is the local authority which must plan this exercise. I agree with the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) that it is very important we should hit on the right person in serving the stop notice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may be the tea boy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will not say that it will be, but under the statute it could be if he is the instrument of continuing development.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If he stops serving tea the work will stop anyway.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a practical, as distinct from a legal, point.<br><br>
But there is no statutory form of stop notice. I would hope that it would be of such a nature that the person to whom it
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 340</span>
is directed would understand its terms and obey them promptly, and not persist in what he was doing. The person writing the stop notice would be the person legally deputed by the local planning authority to issue it. He could be the town clerk or the county clerk or one of his legal assistants, or any person properly deputed by the planning authority so to do.<br><br>
I hope these are three practical answers to the three practical questions I have been asked on this Clause, which, I agree, is a very important one.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Clause, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
</section>
<div class='clause'><span class='label label-warning'>clause</span>
Clause 20</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
COMPENSATION FOR LOSS DUE TO STOP NOTICE</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is another important Clause because, as the Minister said earlier, by writing into the Bill these conditions in relation to compensation we make absolutely certain that the local authority behaves responsibly in the issue of these notices; because if it does not think out in advance the effect of what it is going to do it will have to face claims for compensation. This Clause also makes certain that any recipient of a stop notice is not unfairly penalised in the event of its being incorrect.<br><br>
To return to more legal argument, how does the person who wishes to claim compensation, believing he has a right to do so under this Clause, proceed? To what kind of proceedings will he have to resort in order to, obtain compensation? In the Clause as it stands there is no mention of the form such proceedings should take, and it would help if the Minister would let us know what procedure will have to be followed there.<br><br>
The second point, an important one, referred to earlier by the Minister of State, is: Where does the money come from to pay compensation in the event of a successful claim being made? Does it come entirely from the local rates?
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1003">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 341</span>
Is it to fall completely on the ratepayer? Although he was not dealing specifically with that point the Minister said one restriction on the local authority would be the thought that any compensation to be paid would come from the rates and so would fall on the ratepayers and that, therefore, the local authority would think twice, since the ratepayers would object if the authority had to pay out a great deal of compensation as a result of stop notices not being properly served. Will all the money come from the ratepayers, or is there provision for some of it to come from the central Exchequer in the form of grants available to local authorities? After all, in all this planning procedure the local authority is acting, responsibly, we hope, on behalf of the community; and if notices are served responsibly and a claim for compensation arises later it is important that the local authorities should not be too inhibited in making sure that they stand up for what are the rights of the community.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The answer is that we will prescribe regulations under subsection (4) of this Clause to demonstrate the time and manner in which claims will be made against a local authority by those entitled to compensation.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 342</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Could the Minister give an indication of how he envisages those regulations being drawn?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. It would be difficult to do so at this stage, but certainly there will be regulations drawing the attention of those concerned to the position, and the local authority will have to abide by those regulations. We shall get power to do so from Section 107(1) of the 1947 Act.<br><br>
As for who pays, the answer is that the ratepayer will pay, aided by the central Exchequer. It will be taken as reckonable expenditure. The test will be that we accept that the local authority has acted in line with its obligations to the community at large. I hope the hon. Gentleman will accept that that is a sound way of proceeding. But the initial judgment will be for the local planning authority, and I know that it is one which local authorities will take very seriously.</span></p>
