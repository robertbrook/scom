	<p>	<i>Amendment moved</i> [	<i>22nd April</i>], No. 112, in page 7, line 9, after 'environment', insert' recreational facilities'—[	<i>Mr. Buchanan-Smith.</i>]</p>
	<p>10.31 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we finished our meeting on Tuesday I was discussing writing into the Bill a specific requirement on local authorities to consider recreational facilities as well as general environmental considerations and traffic. I feel, and I am not alone in this, that in the past, particularly in our cities, we have been concerned with building houses to take more and more people, without really giving full consideration to the wider implications of social planning and building up communities in the real sense of the word.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our present generation we have not yet learned the lessons of previous bad planning decisions, where we have created great housing areas without proper provision of the kind of facilities which I am discussing. So often when we discuss questions of crime and delinquency we spend a great deal of time talking about how we should deal with offenders, how we should sentence them, and so on, and do not spend nearly enough time going to the roots of the problem and trying to prevent young people from ever starting on the road to delinquency and crime. I believe that we have an opportunity of writing into this Bill the need to take into account such things as recreational facilities, and to strike right to the roots of the crime and delinquency problem in Scotland today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. N. R. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does by hon. Friend consider that the Easterhouse development problem is a supreme example of that kind of delinquency?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>196</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very glad that that has been raised, because it is precisely the point to which I am going to move next. I am only sorry that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Hugh D. Brown) cannot be here this morning, but he is involved today in meetings in Glasgow in relation to the Easterhouse project. I know he is extremely interested in this Amendment and what is behind it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the problems in a place like Easterhouse is that not nearly enough trouble was taken in the past to make sure that recreational and other social facilities were provided at the same time as the houses were built and the people came in. So often we create housing developments and when trouble arises, such as in Easterhouse, we suddenly start thinking, "My goodness! We must look at these other factors as well and provide social facilities".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to what I said on Tuesday, this Amendment is very much inspired by the representations made to the Government by the Scottish branch of the National Playing Fields Association, which is very anxious to write into this planning Bill specific, statutory, mandatory directives to local planning authorities, to make sure that recreational facilities of a certain standard are provided. I agree with the Minister that there are great difficulties in writing absolute, specific standards into this Bill, so in this Amendment I have tried to place a general obligation on local planning authorities to consider recreation as well as other matters when they are preparing local plans. I want to create a far greater awareness of the problem and of the need to consider recreational facilities at the moment of preparing plans, and not after the houses and roads have been created. There is a fairly good case for doing this, because under the Housing Bill, for example, the Secretary of State is specifically making money available to local authorities for environmental needs such as this in housing clearance areas. Therefore, the Government have admitted the need for this and I hope that they will accept this Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What concerns me most of all at the present time is that the present situation is extremely vague. Whatever people may say they wish to do, we have never specifically written this into any general
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0927">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>197</span>
legislation. The nearest thing to this that I can find is in a Scottish Development Department Memorandum No. 78 of 1967. I should like to read a short piece from that, which illustrates how vague we are at the moment about bringing home to local authorities the need to provide proper recreational facilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Dempsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very interested in the argument which the hon. Gentleman is developing, but good planners always arrange for a number of acres of open space in relation to the density of the community. I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman can give some facts about Easterhouse. Also, can he tell us about other planning authorities which do not provide adequate facilities with housing developments?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to that, and if the hon. Gentleman will wait I will discuss it. I am afraid that I cannot discuss the situation at Easterhouse, because it is not known to me. If the hon. Member for Glasgow, Provan, had been here, I am sure he would have spoken about it. As I said, he has a very good reason for not being here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to Memorandum No. 78 of 1967, under the heading of Provision of Open Space it says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Local authorities are being encouraged to adopt higher open space standards than in the past, and subject to what is said below these higher standards are as relevant to the private housing sector as to the public. In major private housing developments, local authorities may make it a condition of granting planning permission that land is left undeveloped for various open space purposes (children's play space, games pitches, planted areas, reservations for amenity, kickabout grounds and so on) in order to achieve the appropriate standards …".</p></blockquote>
I am sure no one in this Committee will disagree with the sentiments in that Circular, but there is nothing to make sure that local planning authorities provide these facilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When one looks at the English Circulars on the same subject one finds that much more specific standards are laid down than merely a sentiment expressed in the Circular from which I quoted. This was mentioned in the debate in the other place on 7th February, 1968, in a notable debate on sport, when it was said that local authorities were very much encouraged to implement the Parker Morris Report on the provision
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>198</span>
of extra space. I was interested that the Government then said that, for housing schemes with a density of 80 or over per acre, local authorities were specifically asked in a Ministry of Housing and Local Government Circular that 15 to 20 sq. ft. of open space per person should be provided, with a minimum of 10 sq. ft. I welcome that, in so far as a standard is laid down in England and Wales for local authorities to follow. But, so far as I can see, that standard has not been laid down for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, even though these specific standards have been laid down, they are not very ambitious, because a standard of 20 sq. ft. per person means only 1-38 acres per 1,000 of population, which is not very high.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archie Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In Ayrshire we are well above that minimum standard in housing developments I know well. It seems to me passing strange that the hon. Gentleman should be taking this line about more rule from Whitehall and less freedom for local authorities, since we have had so many impassioned pleas from the other side for local authorities to be given more power with less direction from Whitehall.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed that the hon. Gentleman is not following my argument this morning. I am not making a blanket condemnation of local authorities by any manner of means, and there are many local authorities in Scotland, within my own area, and probably within the areas of other hon. Gentlemen, where very adequate facilities have been provided. I appreciate the difficulties of laying down statutory standards, and all I am trying to do is to make local authorities very much more aware of the need to provide facilities at the earliest stage of planning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman attempting to make it mandatory upon local authorities? If he is, it means that he is prepared to take away the powers of local authorities, as my hon. Friend the Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel) has said. There are progressive authorities. My own local authority deserves credit for its planning in this respect. The hon. Member can see the action in my constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why not read the Amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0928">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>199</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, but, as my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) said, it would be very helpful if the hon. Gentleman read the Amendment. If the hon. Gentelman thinks we are taking away power from local authorities by this Amendment and is against it, then he ought to oppose this Bill altogether. All I am saying is that in addition to other facilities, such as traffic, we want to make local authorities consider recreational facilities. I accept that many local authorities have much higher standards, and I am not criticising them for one moment, but the maximum laid down in England and Wales amounts to 1.38 acres per 1,000 and the minimum amounts to only 069 acres per 1,000, which should be compared with the standard recommended very strongly by the National Playing Fields Asociation, of six acres of recreational space per 1,000 of population. Even where standards have been laid down they are not exactly ambitious, and they go only a small way towards the ideal. So we should try to adopt a much more positive attitude towards the provision of adequate playing space and recreational facilities, because, while there are many honourable exceptions, where adequate space is provided, there are other areas where it is not provided. We must legislate for these things. I have mentioned the Easterhouse area. There are other areas as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dempsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Such as? Where in Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are not here to catalogue them. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman knows other areas where adequate facilities have not been provided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dempsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not trying to quibble, but only trying to get some facts, and the number of local authorities which do not provide these amenities. Where I belong we have far too much open space and too little development of housing. If the hon. Member would give more facts that would be helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are many areas in almost every big city in Scotland—for example, Castlemilk in Glasgow and places like that—where, in the initial planning stage, land was available
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>200</span>
but it has not been developed for recreational purposes. That is why I put in "recreational facilities" rather than "areas". There are parts of Edinburgh, Dundee and Aberdeen—I do not want to widen the debate—where facilities are provided, but often they are not readily accessible to the areas where people are living. This is an equally important fact. I have worked for over ten years in youth work in Scotland. From talking to colleagues who have been in the same kind of work, I understand that they have the same problem of finding adequate areas for recreation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Government are sympathetic towards the Amendment and appreciate the spirit in which I have moved it. We are anxious that, in the earliest stages of planning, an obligation should be laid on local authorities to consider these recreational facilities rather than waiting until after all the houses are built and everything else is done and suddenly saying, "Now we have to see what we can do to provide these facilities". By that time the problems to which lack of recreational facilities give rise have arisen, and they create other problems in their train. However, if we get in at the root of the matter we can be more positive and effective in making sure that in planning we think not only in terms of physical planning, but in social terms as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. A. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have heard about pushing at an open door, but a quarter of an hour to argue a case with which I am sure everybody agrees in principle shows a lack of sense of proportion. If that is continued, consideration of the Bill will last for about six months. We ought to have some sense of proportion. I do not want to sit in the Scottish Committee for the next six months dealing with trifling Amendments like this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the right hon. Gentleman regards it as a trifling Amendment. I hope that people outside will take note that he regards it as trifling. My speech would have been infinitely shorter had I not had so many interventions from hon. Gentlemen opposite questioning the spirit in which the Amendment was moved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nobody disagrees with the Amendment or with the purpose of it. There will be Amendments where it
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0929">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>201</span>
is necessary to argue a case, but I should not think this to be one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Undoubtedy the hon. Gentleman is dealing with an important point. I think that my hon. Friends who tried to suggest that local authorities have been immaculate in this respect have been misled. Local authorities may build a lot of beautiful houses in housing schemes, but if they crush the youth of the country into busy streets to play, then they become prison walls for the energy of youth. There must be some outlet for the energy of youth. The energy of youth in Glasgow that is condemned now as delinquency is the same energy which makes heroes in time of war when they have the best opportunities to exert it in a proper cause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that there must be recreational facilities—not only open spaces, because they leaves youth to their own regard, and they do not all want to play football. Society must make some provision to give youth a proper outlet for their energies and intelligence and the contribution that they can make to social life. This is how Easterhouse has given them an opportunity to do something.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to fall into the trap of turning this into a juvenile delinquency debate. However, I think that I should support the hon. Gentleman in what he is seeking, if he needs support, but also to deplore the fact that we have spent so much time arguing a case which is self-evident.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While seeing some point in the right hon. Gentleman's remark about being brief on an Amendment which I am sure the Minister will accept, it is wrong to stifle discussion on a subject which will have a great effect on Scotland for some time to come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend was right in saying that we have frequently missed opportunities over many years in the provision of recreational facilities. Often, when we have made provision for recreation, by perhaps setting it in a green belt area or an area of high landscape value, we have not retained it, and it has been eaten away by housing or industrial development. Years later, with hindsight, we realise that this should not have been done. We must provide recreational
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>202</span>
facilities in an early stage of planning and stick to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend was right in indicating the value of sports and recreation—I am sure that will be accepted by all hon. Members—and we have to allow for regional variations and traditional sports in different parts of the country. The Amendment is valuable because we should keep reminding planning committees that they have a duty to consider recreation and sporting facilities. If it is put in the Bill, then, when dealing with the local plan, it will be brought to their attention forcibly that they have a duty to consider recreational facilities. That is why we should put this into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Minister will confirm, when he replies, that there are many bodies ready and willing to give advice, the Scottish Council for Physical Recreation, the Playing Fields Association, or, indeed, the Sports Council itself, but frequently this advice is bypassed. That is why we should bring to the notice of authorities that they should consider this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want a wider range of facilities. We talked at length, during the passage of the Countryside Bill, about the use of reservoirs for recreation and sport. From my general reading of the newspapers, I find that there is still opposition to the use of reservoirs for sailing, water ski-ing and so on. We must keep plugging away till local authorities accept that this is a feasible proposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must highlight in this discussion that there is an increasing difficulty in Scotland because near so many of our small towns in narrow river valleys the level land which we need for playing fields is becoming harder and harder to retain. It is difficult for a local authority to refrain from seizing the first stretch of level ground it can lay hands on, but this should not be done at the expense of sporting facilities. The hon. Member for Coatbridge and Airdrie (Mr. Dempsey) said that there was far too much open space in his area. That may be his opinion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dempsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said in some areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If one wanted to buy ground for a football pitch or a rugger pitch in the City of Edinburgh, I think one would have the greatest difficulty. I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0930">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>203</span>
have been interested in trying to do that very thing. One has to go out as far as Dalkeith, or well outside the city limits, before there is level ground available for sports facilities. This is why we should plan for it at an early stage and keep it in the local plan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want co-operation between local authorities, because recreational facilities must not necessarily be tied to local authority boundaries. We want co-operation between one authority and another. I think that putting this into the Bill will make local authorities consider it at the local plan stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend went over the point about the number of acres per 1,000 of population, so I will not follow him. My view is that we must keep this figure as high as possible because, in the long run, we shall become a nation wanting more and more recreational facilities. Therefore, it would be silly not to look some way ahead at this moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will accept the Amendment, because it can do only good, and it is not restrictive in any way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Doig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no objection to the inclusion of these words in the Clause, but I am astonished that the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith), when pressed for examples, could quote none, other than Easterhouse, which he kept repeating and about which he admitted he knew absolutely nothing. Does this mean that the problem only exists in what he has read in newspaper reports?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I went on later to say that I had worked amongst youth workers in Scotland for many years. I know from discussion with my colleagues from other areas that this problem exists in their areas. It is also raised every year with the National Planning Fields Association in Scotland. It would not have made representations to the Minister of State unless it believed there was need for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If there is this great need, and if the hon. Gentleman has all this experience of being a member of this Association which receives and deals with all these complaints, it is surprising that he could not quote one example. Is there none of these problems in the hon. Gentleman's constituency? Has he
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>204</span>
not come across any in all his experience with the National Playing Fields Association.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I gain the impression that this is an Amendment simply to waste more time on the Bill. [HON. MEMBERS: "No."] Although the hon. Gentleman does not seem to appreciate it, this is a real problem. We have tried to make provision for these facilities in my constituency. We have considered where children's playgrounds and various other things should be located. But what do we find? When we put them there, we get objections from the tenants nearby that there is too much noise coming from the children's playgrounds near their houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I spent a week, taking nearly a third of the Dundee Town Council with me, interviewing tenants about a proposed scheme where we had this problem. We found that everybody wanted children's playgrounds included in this scheme but not one tenant wanted them within a hundred yards of his house. So, although they wanted them in principle, they did not want them near their houses; they wanted them near somebody else's.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot see this problem being overcome by including these words in the Clause. If members of a council, who went round interviewing the tenants in the area, could not reach agreement on suitable sites, how can a planner, who knows nothing about the area and does not have tenants in the houses at the time because they are not yet built, select the most suitable sites? While I accept the spirit of the Amendment—it is a good thing to have these recreational facilities—I do not think that marking spaces on the local plan for children's playgrounds, football pitches or anything else, will improve matters. We will find what we have often found in the past. The planners can plan for as long and as cleverly as they like, but at the end of the day, the councillors, the people who have to deal with these matters, will get complaints.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question is: will the inclusion of these words in the Clause and, therefore, the obligation, presumably, on the planners to put on the plan a written statement about where these things are to go and what they are to be used for, help the problem? I do not think so.

There always seems to be popular support for physical recreation, for football pitches, children's playgrounds and running tracks, but there is very little support for mental recreation. A recreation which attracts many intelligent young people in my area and produces better behaviour among them, is chess. Yet there is no way of getting help either from the Government or local authorities for the playing of chess. Those who wish to enjoy the game have to go into condemned property and use an old room in a very substandard area. When we consider what Russia does about providing vast sums of money to support this recreation, we should see that it is time we started helping not merely physical but mental recreation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Lawson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry I feel compelled to enter this debate. I will be very short. I almost wholly accept what has been said by the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) and the hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro). I want to see the development of recreational facilities, but, as my right hon. Friend the Member for East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn) has said, this is pushing at an open door. Provision of these facilities has come to be expected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My fear is that as the Amendment highlights the question of provision of organised recreational facilities and playgrounds, their provision in many parts of the countryside might destroy much of its natural life. The Amendment highlights facilities for organised games but might diminish opportunities for and the feeling of the importance of encouraging preservation of natural life and that would be a great mistake. We have so much to be concerned about danger to natural life. I ask the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns not to press the Amendment for the reason that this provision is already accepted and it could go too far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have mentioned before a bird sanctuary near where I live which has been largely spoiled by a motorway which has been constructed very close to it with the result that the protection afforded to birds there has been largely lost. The sanctuary has been there for generations, but
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>206</span>
now it has just disappeared. We cannot say it had to disappear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should also be careful about the preservation of open stretches of water. Much has been said about turning reservoirs into places where water ski-ing and canoeing can be practised, but they perhaps serve a better purpose as still waters where birds can live and where mating birds can come regularly. May be this would be a more valuable function for such places than turning them into stretches of water to be used for canoeing. While we should have facilities for canoeing, we should also preserve places where nature can produce beauty unaided by us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is where the great danger lies: by emphasising the need for recreational facilities we are in danger of undermining the activities of those who would preserve what nature alone can produce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore hope that the Amendment will not be accepted, although I have sympathy with its objects for which it was moved; but it would tend to do great harm in this respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dempsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also have had connection with the National Playing Fields Association. I appreciate its efforts very much and I am absolutely in favour of providing facilities of a recreational nature, but I appear to belong to a different world from that of the hon. Member for Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith), although I have had years of experience of this. In my area we have set out open space facilities in relation to the density of housing we expect in a locality. This is done by every planning officer in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are also using reservoirs for the purpose which has been mentioned by the hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro). One of the finest sailing clubs in Scotland, the Monkland Club, uses a stretch of water in my district, the Hillend Reservoir. This is indicative of the use that can be made of these resources for recreational activities in my part of the country. I do not know what is happening in Dumfries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Progressive authorities such as the one to which I have belonged all my active life make the maximum use of such facilities, and they believe in developing them, and we believe in opportunities for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0932">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>207</span>
mental as well as physical recreation. Although I am not so well versed in chess as my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Doig), I have had the pleasure of meeting the international chess champion from Russia. In my part of the country draughts is a game that is very popular.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously, recreational facilities must be provided, but I hope that hon. Members realise that often when they are provided the facilities are badly damaged. In Lanarkshire we have facilities for football, hockey and running tracks, but unfortunately the pavilions which have been built have been badly damaged by the vandalism of a small and noisy minority of people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult to try to instruct local authorities about what they should do. Local authorities differ very much from one another. Although in Coatbridge we provide these facilities we find it difficult to obtain monetary resources to back them up and the physical education in schools in some places is badly neglected. This is not the fault of the planners, but it is because of lack of resources. I am all in favour of the maximum amount of recreational facilities being provided relative to the other essential needs of the community. Satisfaction of those needs is an essential priority in the planning of our areas. It is not possible to lay down specific conditions as to the acreage used for recreational purposes. Some authorities are so short of essential housing sites that they are not able to provide space for recreation, while others are amply provided for in the matter of housing. Circumstances differ from community to community, and this should be borne in mind. I am very pleased that for forty years I have served on an authority which has made sure that these facilities are provided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. W. H. K. Baker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I briefly say to the hon. Member for Motherwell (Mr. Lawson) that I entirely sympathise, but if this Amendment were accepted would not the sport and the recreation of bird watching be to some extent enhanced? Certain local authorities prohibit people going near to stretches of water where birds nest and migrate. This Amendment would surely facilitate such recreation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>208</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Dr. J. Dickson Mabon)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of my passions as a back bencher was the clearance of derelict sites in Scotland, and one of my prides as a Minister has been that we have cleared so much derelict land in Scotland. We still have a long way to go, and there is a good case for including such a provision. Some time ago my hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge and Airdrie (Mr. Dempsey) made strong and successful representations about the infilling of the Monkland Canal and much good work has been done in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Amendment selects the phrase "recreational facilities" as the one which should be mentioned in the Statute, but mentioning it would make no difference to the operation of the regulations. To that extent it is harmless, but to some extent the Amendment would show up other provisions as of rather secondary importance. That, I am sure, is not what the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) wants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been in correspondence with the National Playing Fields Association, Scottish branch, since some time in February. I sent a letter to the Association on 2nd April and I thought that it was content with what I had suggested as the right way of going about things. The hon. Member suggested that as we had put in the words "traffic management" we should also include "recreational facilities", but recreational provision has been a part of our law since the 1947 Act. He has not argued that Regulations have had no effect but that in some places they have not had a good effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other places, he says, the effect could be better, it could be tightened up. I agree, but he is not doing that with the Amendment. We would have to ask the Government to do it in regulations and through other forms of guidance. He has quoted the 1967 Circular we issued, which I thought was a good one. A lot of authorities have followed it out fully. He asked "Why not go a step further?" The Government are open to doing that, but not by accepting this Amendment. It makes no difference. We could accept this Amendment, and do nothing else. The essential point of achievement for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0933">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>209</span>
the National Playing Fields Association is in the Regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ended my letter of 2nd April—this matter has not been lying dormant for some time—to Mr. Lorimer, the Secretary, by saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We therefore expect that the effect of the Bill would be to make local planning authorities give full consideration to the provision of playing fields and, if there is any reason to feel that this is not being done, there is ample scope for requiring it in specific terms."</p></blockquote>
As a Minister looking at regulations which might flow from this Bill, I could not go further than that in indicating my willingness to look at specific terms. It is awfully difficult to write regulations applying to the County of Angus and the City of Glasgow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I, and many Glasgow councillors of all parties, deplore this constant fixation on one part of Glasgow—it used to be the Gorbals, now it is Easterhouse—as a place which represents a vulgar city run wild, where the youth are neglected. The majority of young people in Glasgow are fine people with good facilities. I would not even accept that because of bad zoning in Easterhouse there have been difficulties there. Anyone who knows Easterhouse knows that is not true.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a very close connection with my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Hugh D. Brown) in planning matters in his constituency. We can zone till we are blue in the face, but that will not add one recreational facility. There has to be the drive in the local government set-up, to take over, not just open spaces and service them, but to take over other parts, playing fields and so on, and that means priorities and money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult to issue a circular which will apply to Angus, where the land is reasonably freely available, and equally to Glasgow, where land is very scarce. I am discussing with Glasgow how we can get a large section of land, 400 acres, for industry, because jobs come first. We have the problem of housing and then of environment. It is difficult to issue a blanket regulation, as equally effective in Inverness-shire as in Coatbridge. One has to use a great deal of encouragement and sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman was saying that if "traffic management" was included why not "recreational facilities"?
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>210</span>
"Traffic management", unlike recreactional facilities, has never been in the planning code. For the first time it is brought into planning deliberately to make the point that it is an integral part of planning. That is why I make no apology for using the words. We are all converts to Buchanan now. We all agree with his lessons, and know how important it is to make a proper assessment of traffic and traffic management. I would not use the argument for the inclusion of the words "traffic management" as one for putting in any other words, particularly "recreational facilities". We could amend the Bill in lots of ways, all of them adding this, that and the other—making it long. If we include one item then the others which are unmentioned take a lesser category.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answer I have given to the Secretary to the National Playing Fields Assocition is a very full one, and, as he said in his letter, it was a reply which showed the great trouble I had gone to in considering his points. If the Association had said that it insisted on its being in Statute, which I would have resisted, if it was doubtful about my intentions in regulations, it would have said so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put it to the hon. Gentleman that he has spoken up well, as has my hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge and Airdrie (Mr. Dempsey) for the National Playing Fields Association, and we have certainly spent a lot of time discussing the problem. I am fully sympathetic towards the argument, but I ask him to allow us to use the powers under subsection (3)(	<i>b</i>) to make regulations for playing fields and public open spaces and so on, as we think they are pertinent to the situation, as we go along. No doubt the Association will use this provision of the Bill to support representations it may make about any item.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of my remarks I would ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister of State for the very constructive way in which he has dealt with this Amendment, which I think is an important one, and for his helpful assurances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to touch on one or two points which have arisen during the debate. I would say to the hon. Member for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0934">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>211</span>
Motherwell (Mr. Lawson) that provision for recreational facilities does not necessarily mean organisation all the time. There is recreation in the peace and quiet of a bird sanctuary on the hills, as he knows. We appreciate the support that he has given to the spirit of the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In contrast with the Minister of State's speech, I felt that others were somewhat destructive of the ideas I was putting forward. The Minister accepts that I was not trying to be critical of local authorities. We should be trying to build up positive ideals towards which local planning authorities can aim. This is what I was trying to do in my Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the remarks of the right hon. Member for East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn), I do not think that this was a waste of time. The interest shown by his hon. Friends disproves him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A disproportionate use of time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have always appreciated that recreational facilities are covered under the blanket of physical environment. I appreciate, too, that if we write in this and not other things it may give a disproportionate importance to this item. In the light of the assurances given us this morning, and to the National Playing Fields Association, and because of the very valuable publicity which I hope that this debate has given to local planning authorities throughout Scotland, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 100, in page 7, line 11, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>(	<i>c</i>) show, and contain a schedule of, all rights of way, footpaths, and bridleways which are situated wholly or partly within their district.</p></blockquote>
I gave the Minister notice at Second Reading that I intended to introduce an Amendment on the lines of this one. I am not convinced that this is the best place in the Bill for it, it might have been preferable to try to insert it somewhere between Clauses 89 and 92.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to try to ascertain at an early stage what is the Government's attitude to this question of making the public aware,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>212</span>
and making local authorities responsible for, the situation on rights of way. I am not at all certain of the difference between a footpath and a bridleway, whether a bridleway is open to human beings or merely to horses and asses. At present there is no way at all for an ordinary member of the public to find out precisely what are rights of way, and where they exist. At present it depends upon custom, usage, rumour and even folklore. I question whether this is good enough in 1969.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a general move towards greater and fairer public access to the open country. The Countryside (Scotland) Act—I had the pleasure to serve on Committee on the Bill—is a manifestation of this desire to encourage the use of our natural heritage, to encourage access by the public to our mountains and countryside. It must be made possible for ordinary members of the public to find out precisely where rights of way are.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dempsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very interested in the point the hon. Gentleman is making. Is he aware that district councils have this power and some do indicate where rights of way are so that the public can use them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. J. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Producing maps does not necessarily mean that the public finds out what is, and what is not a right of way. Nothing would prevent the Ordnance Survey putting rights of way on its maps, or a local stationer from putting them on a map which he publishes, and which are reputed to be rights of way in his area. This does not establish in the minds of the public what are and are not rights of way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 26 of the Countryside Act says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A local planning authority whose area comprises any land—
	<ol>
	<li>which is subject to an access agreement or order, or</li>
	<li>which has been acquired … shall prepare and keep up to date a map, on such scale as may be prescribed, defining in such manner as may be prescribed—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>the land subject to the agreement or order…</li>
	<div class='ul'>
	<li>any land comprised therein which is excepted land;</li></div> <!-- ul -->
	<li>in the case of land acquired and held as aforesaid, any land comprised therein … which, for the purpose of avoiding danger to the public or to persons employed thereon or for any other reason, the public are excluded."</li></ol></ol></p></blockquote>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>213</span>
It talks about public access, but it does not stipulate anything about rights of way. There is no provision for saying where they exist. It is not just necessary for the public to know where they are, but there should be an obligation upon the local authority to show where they are. From time to time it may be necessary for elected members of local authorities to know where they are.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dempsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman aware, as I tried to indicate just now, that in my part of the country some district councils have actually indicated rights of way so the public can use them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to hear it. In my constituency there are many places where rights of way are in dispute, where the public think that a right of way exists, but where the landlord prevents them from using it. There are many ways in which he can do this. It should be made quite definite where these rights of way are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sections 43 to 47 of the Countryside Act discuss rights of way. How can it do so if no one knows where they are? There are constant references to them. It says that they can be ploughed up in certain circumstances. It says that an occupier cannot put bulls on them, and I remember a fairly lengthy argument on that. In certain circumstances it says that gates and stiles may be authorised on them. Where are they? I put it to the Minister that there is a real danger, where there is uncertainty about the existence of a right of way, that the landowner or someone else may use intimidation to keep people off. He may put a dairy bull over ten months old into the field. One can get access, but the landlord can discourage the public from using the path in the hope that it will be disused and that the public, feeling that access——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Only after 40 years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was in a village in Ross-shire where the postmaster told me that he dare not tell visitors where the rights of way were, because of the intimidation by landowners in the area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that these circumstances exist. I will not name names or sites; it would not be wise at this
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>214</span>
stage; but, if necessary, I can quote a volume of evidence to back up what I say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The onus of legally proving the existence of a right of way should be on a local authoritly and not on an individual. Why should there not be one local map or plan for the purpose of the Countryside Act, to show public access, and for the purposes of Clause 6 of this Bill, which places obligations on a local planning authority? I can see no reason why the same map should not serve both purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 46(1) of the Countryside (Scotland) Act says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It shall be the duty of a local planning authority to assert, protect and keep open and free from obstruction or encroachment any public right of way which is wholly or partly within their area, and they may, for these purposes, institute and defend legal proceedings and generally take such steps as they may deem expedient."</p></blockquote>
That is spendid, but it does not deal with whereabouts of rights of way. Till they are put on an official map, with a key which indicates firmly to the public where there is a right of way, how are the local authorities to know in what circumstances they can take legal proceedings?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is in England—and this is another reason for altering this legislation, although it may not be the best place, in the Bill, to make the change—a statutory obligation to show rights of way. It is an anomaly that these should be a statutory obligation in England and Wales and not in Scotland. I quote from the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act, 1949, Section 27(1):
	<br><blockquote><p>"Subject to the provisions of this Part of this Act,"—</p></blockquote>
This Section does not aply to Scotland, although one Section of the Act does——
	<br><blockquote><p>"the council of every county in England and Wales shall, as soon as may be after the date of the commencement of this Act, carry out a survey of all lands in their area over which a right of way to which this Part of this Act applies is alleged to subsist, and shall, not later than the expiration of three years after that date or of such extended period as the Minister may in any particular case allow, prepare a draft map of their area, showing thereon a footpath or a bridleway, as may appear to the council to be appropriate, wherever in their opinion such a right of way subsisted, or is reasonably alleged to have subsisted, at the relevant date.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(2) A map prepared in accordance with the last foregoing subsection shall also show thereon any way which, in the opinion of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0936">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>215</span>
authority carrying out the survey (hereinafter referred to as 'the surveying authority'), was at the relevant date, or was at that date reasonably alleged to be, a road used as a public path".</p></blockquote>
In view of this I suggest that the Minister of State gives serious consideration to my point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a greater need in Scotland for the indication of such rights of way because of the existence of an iron-handed feudal system which I and many others have made unsuccessful attempts to have modified. Where there is doubt about public right of way, the landlords or their servants can prevent access by a number of ways. They can use padlocks or gamekeepers with Land Rovers and guns. I have personal experience of this. Why should Scotland, in this respect, lag behind England in legislation? There is a need to place a statutory obligation on local authorities in Scotland to indicate where rights of way exist.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Clark Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In general I support the statements of the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. James Davidson). In an intervention the hon. Member for Coatbridge and Airdrie (Mr. Dempsey) talked about district councils issuing maps, but we must remember that probably under the new local authority arrangements which are to come about district councils will disappear. So I think his statement was a little irrelevant. I base my wish to see this Amendment made on a general principle. The State and all government apparatus at the moment is like a thundering great octopus which is ever growing, and I want to see its tentacles clipped. I think what the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West has said goes some way to giving rights to individuals and opportunities for them to know where they stand and what they can and cannot do. That is the general principle on which I yesterday voted for the Bill of the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Viscount Lambton) which the Government opposed. That is why I support this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I have a powerful association which will resist any such proposals to the utmost. This should not be allowed to cloud the issue. The hon. Member is trying to anticipate events which may never happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that they have problems in other parts of the country which we do not have to any extent in the South and to the West. I am not averse to the arguments which the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. James Davidson) has used for this Amendment, but I would like to relate my experience as a member of a district council dealing with rights of way problems for forty years. We were able to establish rights of way by an ancient device: proving that some people walked along a path in 1912. We brought someone to establish that, and when we had, we were home and dry. We took the appropriate action against a farmer who erected barricades; we had no trouble in getting rid of them and we restored the right of way to the general public. We brought people who had walked along that route. This illustrated that district councils have powers to deal with this problem and that there is no need for members of the public to consult solicitors. They can act through the district council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point the hon. Member makes about 1912 is interesting, but if he is right, it is obviously going to become more and more difficult.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dempsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said I was not averse to the hon. Member's argument because of that. The year 1912 is getting further and further back and those who walked the path in 1912 are gradually disappearing. I have had personal experience of digging up people—[	<i>Laughter.</i>] That is a wonderful metaphor! I was able to dig them up without any trouble—after the Labour Government's National Health Service began, they were lively corpses! I am almost certain that 1912 was the year, and we were able to produce a map to show a path, and to produce people who had walked that path. On that basis we were able to have the right of way restored. The district council accepted the responsibility, rather than individual members of the community. I

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>217</span>
am satisfied that the experience of the hon. Gentleman for Aberdeenshire, West in the north means that something will have to be done to ensure that this right and prerogative of the general public is enforced from time to time where it has been established that there is a right of way used by the public.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The main concern of the hon. Gentleman was on that part of the Amendment relating to rights of way. The provision of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949, Section 27, is in effect duplicated by Part III of the Countryside (Scotland) Act which in Section 30(3) defines a public path as being
	<br><blockquote><p>"a way which is a footpath or bridleway or combination of those".</p></blockquote>
There is provision in the following Section for the provision of a map.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When Section 27, to which the hon. Gentleman referred, refers to rights of way, it is clear that it is referring to rights of way, whether footpaths or bridleways. Section 27 imposes a duty
	<br><blockquote><p>"to prepare a draft map … showing thereon a footpath or a bridleway".</p></blockquote>
It is analogous to the Countryside (Scotland) Act, 1967, which says that a council may prepare a map defining land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the kind of circumstances which the hon. Member mentioned, where there is a dispute between a land-owner and another member of the public as to whether or not there is a right of way, the kind of matter which the hon. Member for Coatbridge and Airdrie (Mr. Dempsey) referred to is settled by the courts. I had a case in my constituency not long ago where builders closed what was said to be a right of way. Unless a right of way has ceased to be used for 40 years the right does not fly off, and it is always possible for anyone contending that a right of way exists to establish in evidence that within the last 40 years it has been used as such. So I have much sympathy with what the hon. Member is seeking to put, but I do not think it is necessary. If it is necessary, I suggest that the proper place to put it is in the Countryside Act. If it is not already covered, the hon. Gentleman might consider an Amendment to that Act, rather than incorporating it into this legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Dickson Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged to the hon. and learned Gentleman for seeking to assist me by giving all the references. I confess to a very strong prejudice in favour of what the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. James Davidson), said. He will remember that during the debates on the Countryside Bill, in which he took quite a conspicuous part, we discussed the differences in the law of trespass 	<i>vis-à-vis</i> Scotland and England—and I remember that our distinguished Chairman took a very active part in the proeedings, although I will not quote all he said—and we ended up with my assuring my hon. Friend the Member for Motherwell (Mr. Lawson), who also took an active part and asked about Scottish rights of way, that
	<br><blockquote><p>"We should try to record all the current rights of way and in a positive manner seek to use persuasion so that the disputed rights of way would be opened up under the Bill through access agreements. That is the possible kind of way that we are seeking. I do not go as far as my hon Friend suggested by putting in the dotted lines denoting disputed rights of way, because I do not want confusion or irritation to be caused. I want the map to be a positive incentive."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 8th June, 1967; c. 308.]</p></blockquote>
That was referring to Section 26 of the Countryside (Scotland) Act, 1967. I take the point made by the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie), that this Amendment would be more apposite to the Countryside (Scotland) Act than to this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested in what the hon. Gentleman had to say about having information of specific difficulties in various Scottish constituencies, and I have no doubt that other hon. Members have this, too. I am perfectly willing to ask the Countryside Commission to give me information about this, to see what it has done in following up Section 26 and the subsequent Sections, and to see what it intends to do as well, as what it has done, and to consider that in the light of any representations which hon. Members would like to make to me about specific instances where there are still difficulties. The Countryside (Scotland) Act was meant to be an exercise in persuasion, to persuade landowners in disputed areas as well as in non-disputed areas. I do not mean about established rights of way, but about places where
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0938">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>219</span>
we would want to have new access agreements and to clear up disputed ones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am perfectly willing to go into this in detail, but I do not think it is right that I should accept this Amendment at this stage. If we are in difficulties on specific matters, we can easily use the provisions of Clause 6(3)(	<i>b</i>) if we feel that there are particular areas specially appropriate for producing local plans including these provisions. My objection to the hon. Gentleman's Amendment is really that it is such a blanket Amendment. Of course, I realise that it has to be, in order to get home the specific points he wants to make. It says,
	<br><blockquote><p>"all rights of way, footpaths, and bridleways which are situated wholly or partly within their district."</p></blockquote>
It would impose very heavy burdens on most authorities which at present have no difficulty, and I am sure he does not want that absolute duty imposed on everybody in regard to all rights of way and so on. But I take his point that there may be a case where we have difficulties and where we might have to invoke some regulation of a specific kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So on the strength of two assurances, first, that I will look into what the Countryside Commission is doing, and intends to do, in this regard—and hon. Members will assist me by giving me specific examples which are worthy of investigation by the Countryside Commission—and, secondly, that if we find that under the Countryside (Scotland) Act the Commission cannot carry out what is obviously in the public interest, because it is being opposed unreasonably by a private individual, and that although we are doing all we can under the Countryside (Scotland) Act we are driven to make regulations under Clause 6(3)(	<i>b</i>), I am willing to consider——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman not already have compulsory powers under Section 31 of the Countryside (Scotland) Act for the creation of public paths? Section 30 says that a public path

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would say, yes, I think I have. But then we all know that, when we make speeches about things in general, we often have specific questions in mind,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>220</span>
and I am not prepared, as a Minister, to say that I have power to cover every specific instance. After all, the hon. Gentleman has not laid out any specific cases this morning. I am perfectly willing to investigate—and I am not confining this to him; I am sure he would not want that. I think we have enough powers, but, if we do not, Clause 6(3)(	<i>b</i>) is there. What is much more important is that we ought to see how the Countryside Commission is doing with this, and, if it does not know of the grievances which the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West and other hon. Members have, then they ought to be brought to the attention of the Countryside Commission so that it can sort them out. But it is not right to make this Amendment now, even though I have a great deal of sympathy for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. James Davidson) replies, may I just say—I find these discussions very interesting——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have noticed that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—that Section 31 is essentially a matter of countryside legislation, as the Minister agrees, rather than town planning legislation. What Section 31 of the 1967 Act says is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where it appears to a local planning authority that there is need for a public path over land in their area and they are satisfied that, having regard to
	<ol>
	<li>the extent of the path … and</li>
	<li>the effect which the creation of the path would have on the rights of persons interested in the land…</li></ol>
it is expedient that the path should be created, the authority, if it appears to them impracticable to create the path by means of a public path creation agreement, may by order (in this Act referred to as a 'public path creation order') made by them and submitted … create such a public path."</p></blockquote>
That seems to me exactly the power which the hon. Gentleman wants, because subsection (3) later says,
	<br><blockquote><p>"A public path creation order shall be in such form as may be prescribed and shall contain a map, on such scale as may be prescribed"—</p></blockquote>
it is the wording in an earlier Amendment which the hon. Gentleman found so difficult to follow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is rather different.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I say how very glad I was to hear the Minister of State saying that he will have investigated the rather sweeping allegations made by the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. James Davidson), because I think allegations of that kind are fairly damaging? They are obviously, in large part, a slur on landowners. It is easy to do. If he has specific cases, I am surprised that he has not brought them to the attention of the proper authorities long before now. I am perfectly certain and I feel he probably agrees with me, that certain landlords who have been in default of the rules about rights of way are a very, very small minority of the whole, and perhaps the hon. Gentleman will take the opportunity of making that clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall respond to what the noble Lord said later. May I first thank the Minister very much for his reply, and for his general attitude to this Amendment? I should also like to thank the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) for his helpful contribution. I am grateful to the Minister for saying that he will take up this matter with the Countryside Commission, and if hon. Members know of any such cases I shall be most grateful if they will bring them to the attention of the Minister. I, for one, intend to take this up, perhaps in a letter to the local Press, asking members of the public to let me know if they know of any specific cases. I know of one or two cases which I shall pursue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I say to the noble Lord that I was not intending by any manner of means to spread a general smear over landowners. There are landowners and landowners. There are good, bad and indifferent, just as there are in other classes and categories of society. There are many who are most generous and lenient in their attitude to public access to their land. So I hope the noble Lord will accept that I did not intend a general smear. In the body of this Amendment
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>222</span>
I was trying to get at the matter of general access for recreational purposes, not just at the question of disputes on specific instances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I conclude by asking the Minister one hypothetical question? If a case is registered where there is a dispute between the owner of the land and the public as to the existence of a right of way, what procedure should be followed? Obviously, the Minister himself does not want to be bothered about every minor dispute. Should it be taken up first through the local authority, or should people write direct to the Countryside Commission and get the Commission to take up the matter with the local authority? What does the Minister regard as the most suitable procedure in cases of this sort? Subject to his reply, I shall ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged to the hon. Gentleman. I would direct his attention to Section 46 of the Countryside (Scotland) Act 1967:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It shall be the duty of a local planning authority to assert, protect and keep open and free from obstruction or encroachment any public right of way which is wholly or partly within their area, and they may for these purposes institute and defend legal proceedings and generally take such steps as they may deem expedient."</p></blockquote>
If I were a member of the public who was aggrieved, I would raise the matter with my local councillor, and if I got nowhere I would raise it with my Member of Parliament. If I still got nowhere I would raise it with the Secretary of State or one of his seven dedicated Ministers, and I am certain that action would be taken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, there are six of them in Scotland. I was thinking of an 	<i>ex officio</i> member, the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie), who assists us on some occasions. Also, the Scottish Rights of Way Society is very good and very active. But I honestly do not see how any member of the public could fail to draw the attention of the authorities to a breach of a legal requirement. After all, we are talking about existing local rights of way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is perhaps a point which the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands is not stressing a great deal.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0940">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>223</span>
He has talked about the new accesses that we are making under the Act, but he is worried about existing and disputed rights of way. They may by disuse or apparent bad actions by landlords fall out of use and not be recorded. But I am very glad that with those assurances the hon. Member is willing not to press the Amendment——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the local authority have jurisdiction under Section 46(1), where the issue in dispute is whether or not there is a right of way? That Section imposes a duty on local authorities
	<br><blockquote><p>"to assert, protect and keep open and free from obstruction or encroachment any public right of way".</p></blockquote>
What the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. James Davidson) is concerned about is what happens where there is a dispute as to whether or not the right of way exists. If that is the point at issue I doubt whether Section 46(1) helps. The remedy there would be for those asserting the existence of the right of way to proceed by way of declaration in the Court of Session.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may be so. It would depend on the judgment of the local authority in the first instance, as to whether or not it was right in asserting, protecting and keeping open. It has first to decide that, and in its discretion it may decide that it was not right, in which case the constituent may want to go to the Member of Parliament, or to raise the matter with Countryside Commission, or with one of the Ministers in Scotland. This matter can be resolved as we go along.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One small point. This is getting down to the remaining elements of controversy. Suppose a member of the public asserts that there is a right of way and that there is uncertainty by the local authority whether it can back this up and it is unwilling to take legal proceedings, perhaps for social reasons or because of the composition of the local authority. Is the step then open to members of the public who feel that such a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>224</span>
right of way exists to proceed to their Member of Parliament, and through him either the Minister or the Countryside Commission would take action, if necessary? I should like the Minister's assurance on this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given that the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Legally, yes, taking it through the legal process—if the local authority has not reported against it, the matter can be reported to the Countryside Commission or to the Minister, who can then seek advice and decide whether the local authority is acting properly in that instance. But we are here getting into hypothetical realms. I think by this stage the facts would have become so clear that it would be simply resolved. I should like to get down to specific instances, and that is what I am inviting all hon. Members to provide. But I will certainly turn to the Countryside Commission for its experience on this matter so far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We seem to be coming to describe every Clause, on the Question, That the Clause stand part of the Bill, as being fundamental and critical to the Bill. I see that this has happened on several occasions, from my reading of the Report of our previous proceedings. But I believe that this is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0941">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>225</span>
a critical Clause. This is one part or the Bill where planning affects the ordinary person. It will be through the local plan that any planning decisions will really bite. Therefore, it is of great importance, and we should not just let it pass without debate on the Question, That the Clause, as amended stand part of the Bill. I do not intend to delay the Committee very long, but I should like to ask for information about a number of points which were not covered in Amendments which we have considered. We have had a fairly lengthy debate on some items this morning. For that reason I will go through these points as quickly as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, will the Minister give us a little more information about the kind of map which he envisages will be part of the local plan? Subsection (3) states,
	<br><blockquote><p>"A local plan shall consist of a map and a written statement…".</p></blockquote>
It would be helpful to know what form the Minister expects the map to take. Will it be based on the Ordnance Survey map which is readily available to and understood by all members of the public? It is a small but important point and I hope that we may hear something about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I wish to raise a query about subsection (4):
	<br><blockquote><p>"Different local plans may be prepared for different purposes for the same part of any district."</p></blockquote>
I welcome the fact that different plans can be prepared for different purposes, because it obviously gives greater flexibility. It means that for a specific problem, such as traffic, a separate plan can be prepared dealing with that particular aspect. It will make clearer to people what is involved in that aspect than if a plan is cluttered up with a number of different things. This flexibility is welcome, but if it were carried to the limit we could have an infinite number of different plans and maps covering different aspects of local development: plans for traffic, housing, recreation, industry and so on. Carried to its absurd limit the situation could be ludicrous. Whilst in principle I accept this as a good move towards flexibility, I should like to hear how the Minister envisages this developing and how the different plans for different purposes will be brought together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>226</span>
I should also like to raise a slightly more fundamental point about the organisation of planning authorities. As planning authorities are organised at present, in most cases the authority preparing the structure plan will be the same authority preparing and bringing forward the local plan. I may, perhaps, be raising an element of conjecture about the future, but under local government reform, particularly if a two-tier system arose, it is conceivable that a structure plan might be prepared by a higher level authority and the responsibility for the local plan might rest with a second-tier authority. Therefore, one would have two different planning authorities dealing with the structure plan and local plan. I should be interested to hear how the Minister feels this kind of thing might develop. It obviously raises issues about the relationship between different levels of planning authorities, and co-ordination of decisions and how decisions in principle on the structure plan are to be carried forward in practical terms in the local plan. Whilst I appreciate there is an element of conjecture in it—and I do not intend to develop that further—it is important to know how the Minister sees this developing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, we welcome the Clause because of its importance and the way it affects the ordinary individual, but we would like a little more clarification on these specific points which have not been debated on any Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has certainly asked me to prognosticate a great deal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I always enjoy doing that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The trouble is that the hon. Gentleman often does not distinguish between the words "prognosticate" and "promise ". There is a difference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister should know.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman regards every prognostication as a promise when it suits him and abandons them otherwise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not intend to be brought into the argument about local government reform. I do not know what the Royal Commission will recommend in Scotland, so it is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0942">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>227</span>
not wise to enter into a debate on that just now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is proper that we should look at what is said in the Clause about the different nature of the local plans, because they are important. I shall seek to answer the three or four points which the hon. Gentleman raised about the various kinds of plans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of these plans, which must follow from the structure plan, is the action area plan which will define precisely the area which the local planning authority has selected for comprehensive treatment, whether by way of development, redevelopment, improvement or a combination of one or more of these, and will go as far as is appropriate, in setting out the details of action proposed. If we consult the Planning Advisory Group's Report, we will see examples of what maps for action areas will represent. They are quite definitive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not agree that the general public easily follow Ordnance Survey maps. Anyone who has been in the Army or has any knowledge of map reading realises that Ordnance Survey maps are sometimes difficult to follow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not in the Argylls.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps not in the Argylls. As a former member of the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry I can endorse that. It is probably true of the infantry, but I was not talking about the infantry or even the light infantry. I was talking about the general public. In as much as people understand plans, I think that the action area plan for these purposes will be readily appreciated and understood, and there will be considerable detail in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The terms of the Bill and the intended regulations will permit a range of treatment—we are all agreed that there should be this flexibility—from the fully detailed to a document which, in its nature, is a brief for the developer which will lay down guidelines and indicate the desired result, whilst leaving the developer to draft and submit his own building schemes within the limits of that brief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A third category of local plan will be concerned to present a particular policy of the authority—for example, for rural recreation or for the working of minerals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>228</span>
In other words, there could be this type of functional plan. Their purpose will be to display the working out of the general policy of the authority in more detailed terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraphs (	<i>a</i>) and (	<i>b</i>) of subsection (3) are designed to meet different varieties of local plans. I take the hon. Gentleman's point that with the change in local government that is to come it might be decided that structure plans are the affair of a larger planning authority and that local plans are the affair of a second-tier authority. However, I cannot say that that will be so. There may only be one tier of authority or there may be three tiers of authority. It may be decided that planning will remain the complete function of one, or it could be divided among three. That is conceivable. I should not like to prognosticate or look into the future on that score.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Bill becomes law we will have to look at this Statute and the previous Statutes concerning local government and adapt them to the major Statute which will reform local government. At that stage I should be able to answer the hon. Gentleman's questions. I have no doubt that the Government—I am sure it will be this Government—will decide to recommend to the House——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that a prognostication or a promise?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a firm promise, which will be realised, and on which I am willing to put money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How much?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must not tempt me into making wagers at this moment. We can discuss this privately. The hon. Gentleman is wealthy enough to lose money, so I am willing to take him on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At that stage I should be prepared to answer the latter points raised by the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith). I agree that this is an important Clause, because it describes the different varieties of local plans.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 113, in page 8, line 10, after 'given', insert 'to every ratepayer affected'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to speak for very long. All hon. Members of the Committee will know what we are driving at this Amendment. There was discussion on a similar point on Clause 3.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Briefly, my experience—no doubt it is the experience of other hon. Members, too—has been that, in planning cases, there is not enough publicity planning proposals. Operations take place and ideas are formulated, and the general public does not know what is happening or why.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The aim of the Amendment is to make sure that the general public and the householder—I see it is the word "ratepayer" here—is informed of what is proposed. There is no question here of great cost. I do not suggest that all the plans should be sent to each individual. I suggest that a postcard or a note is put in with the rate demand, or any other cheap means used, advising every ratepayer or householder that there are these plans and where and when they can be examined in detail. This is the only object of this Amendment.

I think it a fair one, because there has been so much puzzlement in the past when things have crept up on people and they have known about them only when it was too late to protest or to get alterations made. If this Amendment is accepted, as I hope it will be—I am prepared to vote for it—some alteration of Clause 10 will be necessary, because that Clause deals with subsequent changes in a plan. If there is a subsequent change people should be told about it. When a plan is agreed and everyone knows about it, will it be adhered to? I seriously object to a plan being made, perhaps an inquiry being held at which objections are upheld, and then the authority coming back with its original proposals. There has been a well-known case of this in my constituency. It is an injustice which I want to stop. I do not know whether it can be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>230</span>
done under this Clause, but I may raise it later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The word which makes me wish to support this Amendment is "publicity" which appears in the subsection."Publicity" suggests the placing of notices in newspapers and public display of that kind. I do not think it is in any sense adequate when a local authority is making plans which may change the lives, the property and convenience of people in an area to put a notice in a newspaper saying that a plan was being prepared. We must insist that this information goes to every ratepayer who is affected, and I mean by that a postal communication of some kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was glad that my hon. Friend explained that this is not an attempt to have vast rolled up maps sent in detail to every ratepaper in a district. All that is required is a clear, specific, brief communication to every ratepayer concerned warning him of what is in train and where he can see the plan and see how he is affected. This could be done at such little cost that the Government ought readily to accept the proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If they accept it they will give assurance to many people, particularly in cities, who, perhaps wrongly, feel that these things are done without the ratepayers being informed. I have had cases in which people have complained of the effects of planning decisions on their properties. On investigation it has been found that all the present standards have been perfectly adequately followed and that notice was given that a plan was being prepared, objections received and the plan could be inspected in the local authority's offices. Many people do not run their lives in a way which guarantees that they see notices in local newspapers. They may be abroad during the critical weeks when the notices are inserted and their friends may not tell them about the notices when they come back.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) is quite right in saying that we must make it absolutely mandatory on those preparing a plan to send a postal communication to everyone affected so that all may know their rights and how they are likely to be affected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that was said in the Amendment it would be much easier, but that is not what is said. It is said that adequate publicity should be given "to every ratepayer affected". I do not disagree with the intention, but if we accept the Amendment it could be held that we could rest content on a mere slip of paper being sent out telling a ratepayer that there were adequate facilities for him to see the plan. I accept that it would be a good idea to notify the ratepayers, but this would be difficult, because not every ratepayer would be concerned with the local plan.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: "Every ratepayer affected".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But who is "every ratepayer affected"? This is very tricky. It would be far safer to use the established local authority machinery to notify all ratepayers, but that raises the interesting question about those on the periphery of a local plan. What if the local plan affected the area adjacent to the authority? The ratepayers in the nextdoor authority ought to be consulted in some way. This raises a very difficult question. It could be resolved far better by definitive regulations than by seeking to amend the statute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all agree that it would not be necessary to send a map, but a local plan would consist of a map with an explanation. If we do not want to send out a map and go to enormous expense but we are anxious that all who are concerned should know about a proposal, I am perfectly willing to look carefully at the procedural regulations and to discuss and argue these things with the local authority Associations at such time as we make regulations. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) is a very fair man and his argument is an important one, even though he put it briefly. I should like to give careful consideration to the question of how this matter would be put in regulations. This is subject to the Skeffington Committee Report. I do not know what the Committee may recommend, but I hope that it will report in July. It has to consider how to publicise planning and on the basis of that we shall be making regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have felt very anxious about the present legislation and adequate publicity,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>232</span>
and the question of getting people voluntarily to publicise their proposals adequately. We have done this in Edinburgh and elsewhere, but we have not done it enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the point that we should see that individuals who do not normally read the Press or pay attention to what is going on in their community ought to be considered and that we should see how their attention can be drawn to what is happening, particularly in reference to local plans. What that assurance, I hope the hon. Member will accept my 	<i>bona fides</i> and that I propose to explore with the local authorities the possibility of prescribing a requirement that some kind of general notification should be given through the established machinery.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the regulations to follow under the exercise of statutory powers be subject to approval by both Houses of Parliament? Probably I should know this from reading the Bill. The difficulty is that, quite rightly, I think over a wide field we are leaving power to proceed by regulation. This is quite common in planning matters, but in a matter of this nature it is very important that Parliament should be satisfied that the proposals contained in the regulations should have its 	<i>imprimatur</i> so to speak. It should not be just left to the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know how active is the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) in these matters. If he is dissatisfied with the regulations when they are published he can raise the matter in Parliament. I hope that before doing so he would write saying, "This is not good enough. It is not quite what I meant in my speech in the Committee. Will you be good enough to look at it again? "It may be that local authorities will see objections to the precise form of the regulations. This Committee cannot make regulations. We have to consult the local authorities, because they have to work this out and put it into practice. In the last analysis an hon. Member can say, "This is not right. You have not played fair. We want you to correct the regulations."We shall make sure that we discuss this matter and all other relevant points with the local authority Associations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will be grateful to the Minister of State for the assurances he has given this morning. The last time we raised this matter, on 15th April, the hon. Gentleman raised all sorts of difficulties about how much it would cost.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was on the structure plan.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but when we put forward an Amendment about the structure plan we qualified it by saying that we were not asking for every ratepayer to have the structure plan. I am glad that the hon. Gentleman has been more reasonable this morning and has not read into the Amendment far greater difficulties than are in it. He is quite right in suggesting that this publicity is more important in relation to the local plan than the structure plan, because the individual householder is much more likely to be affected by the local plan, and it is important that people in a. particular area should know what is involved in the proposals. When we talk about action areas it becomes even more important that those affected should know what is going on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not see this proposal in any sense as an expensive procedure involving sending plans round a district. We see it purely as a notification to the ratepayer that the plan can be seen at a particular place and a particular time. We accept that, in some ways, this Amendment, in its precise form, could be textually difficult of interpretation, and there is the question of whether the word should be "ratepayer" or "occupier", which ratepayers are affected, and so on. There is difficulty in interpretation, but the principle in the Amendment, which the Minister has acknowledged, is important. For that reason we are grateful for his assurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We accept what he said about regulations. Regulations under planning legislation are quite common, but what slightly worries me, and I am sure it worries my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison), is that we are leaving a tremendous amount to regulations. However, as these are regulations which we can debate, if we wish, when they come before us, and the Minister is anxious to discuss them further with the local authorities,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>234</span>
I advise my hon. Friend to withdraw his Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister of State for the constructive way in which he has answered my hon. Friend's remarks. When he gives the undertaking, which he did, that he would discuss this when producing regulations, I want it to be clearly understood that the point of principle I am after is that the notification should be by individual communication, and not general advertisement. I do not mind how cleverly exhibitions are mounted, how well the Press is plastered with three-inch double column advertisements to make this clear. As this plan can mean a great deal, often hundreds of pounds or even thousands, to residents in the value of their property, it must be by individual communication to the ratepayers. If the Minister can devise a method of doing that I would be quite satisfied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, am grateful to the Minister of State for his reply. I think that he understands the position. But I must say that I have been raising this point for a very long time, with my own Government as well as with this one. Neither would move on amending the planning Acts. So I am a bit distrustful of the general statements made. Here is a chance to register a vote, and I am tempted to do so. I probably will not, because the Minister has been absolutely genuine. He says that he will talk it over with local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They may use a lot of soft soap on him and the regulations may not be satisfactory. Some of these planning authorities act like pirates, and so do Government Departments. I have had instances in my own constituency. I admit that in Edinburgh there have sometimes been cases of this piracy. I want to prevent this, and I want to register a vote on this important point, because I am a little afraid that the Minister will be overwhelmed by local authorities—that they will get at him. I want this provision on the Statute Book. For that reason, although there is nothing personal about it, I feel that I must register a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Because of the layout of this group of Clauses there is really raised in this Amendment, and Amendment No. 11, the basic criticism of the provisions of Clause 9. I trust that it will be in order to draw attention to the provisions of</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>236</span>
	<p>do not see why in this sort of case, which can deeply affect people, they should not do the same. I speak from personal knowledge here, because I discovered, purely by chance, by a chatty column in a newspaper, something which affected me and my family. Notice probably had been inserted properly elsewhere, but one does not always notice these things. Even though Members of Parliament are probably more used to reading newspapers than most people, it is possible to miss these things. When there is something likely to affect a member of the public there is no reason why the local authority should not do this.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question put</i>, That the Amenment be made:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 11, Noes 11.</p>
	<p>Clause 9, to which these Amendments, albeit to Clause 7, take exception.</p>
	<p>What is proposed is that if there are objections to a local plan the local planning authority has an obligation to
	<br><blockquote><p>"… cause a local inquiry or other hearing to be held by a person appointed by the Secretary of State or, …"</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>by a person appointed by the authority, under the terms of the regulations under that part of the Measure. That provision is objected to in Amendment 16, by which it is proposed to delete the provision that the local authority can appoint a person itself. That is an important matter, but the main question really arises in this way.</p>
	<p>After a public inquiry has been held into objections to which a local planning authority is a party, the ultimate decision on the amendment or otherwise of the plan to which objections have been made is to be left with the local planning authority. That is where Clause 9 comes in.</p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0947">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>237</span>
	<p>Clause 9(1) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"After the expiry of the period afforded for making objections to a local plan or, if such objections have been duly made during that period, after considering the objections so made, the local planning authority may"</p></blockquote>
subject to certain statutory provisions by resolution adopt the plan either as originally prepared or as modified to take note of any matters arising out of such objections.</p>
	<p>We recognise, as in other circumstances, that this wide discretion is qualified by the fact that the Secretary of State may give directions, in this case under Clause 9(3) that the plan cannot be adopted unless approved by him. That is an exception. The general rule will be that the local planning authority will have the responsibility of deciding whether to modify the plan as a result of objections to it.</p>
	<p>This raises a very important point of principle, which arises in Part III of the Bill, and it is one which the Committee should consider carefully before sanctioning this change. The principle involved is whether a party to proceedings, be they judicial or quasi-judicial, should have the ultimate decision in a dispute.</p>
	<p>Apart from that there are practical questions as to what impression this will have in the minds of the public. One of the desirable objects of this legislation is to try to bridge the gap between what I may describe, for shortness, as the planners, and those who are being planned. It has often been said that this is one of the problems which we are faced with, and one of the problems which we are here seeking to resolve. I cannot think of anything more detrimental to the relations between the planners and those being planned than that if there is a challenge to the proposals put forward by the planning authority, the final arbiter in a dispute is that authority.</p>
	<p>I dare say that underlying this proposition is the view that it is imposing too heavy a burden on the Secretary of State and his Department to resolve those decisions. That is the present position. Amendment No. 18, which is in essence what we seek to put into the legislation, provides that the Secretary of State is to be the person who is to approve plans.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>238</span>
He may approve a plan submitted to him either
	<br><blockquote><p>"without modification or subject to such modifications as he may consider expedient, and in the exercise of his powers under this subsection he shall have regard to the Report of any person appointed by him under the provisions of the proceeding subsection".</p></blockquote>
That, in essence, is the existing arrangement under Section 3(4) of the 1947 Planning Act, because that subsection, which is followed by a long proviso, provides
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may approve any development plan submitted to him under this section either without modification or subject to such modifications as he considers expedient".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>Compliments have been paid on other occasions to the work of the Secretary of State's Department. I do not wish to repeat them. They were all justified. The essential value of the approach of the 1947 Act is that it gives the public a feeling that some third party is taking the ultimate decision on a dispute between themselves and the planning authority, and that it is in accordance with what has sometimes been described as the principle of natural justice.</p>
	<p>I said during Second Reading debate—and I am sorry that the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) is net with us, because this is the kind of thing that would appeal to his legal mind—that it is wrong in principle that a party to a dispute should have the decision upon it. So long as we have this third party procedure, a decision taken by someone other than one of the parties to the dispute, there is a feeling in the public mind of fairness and willingness to accept a decision. I do not say that private objectors to local planning authority plans which are taken on appeal, or taken to the Secretary of State in this way, are always satisfied with the decision they get; obviously not; but at least it is fair to say that there is a feeling in the public mind that they have had a fair inquiry and an opportunity of expressing their views and that the decision has been taken by a responsible authority which is not a party to the dispute.</p>
	<p>I ask the Government seriously to consider whether it is right to go back on provisions of this kind which accord with the principles to which I have referred and have the practical result on the public which I have mentioned. I ask the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0948">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>239</span>
Government to weigh the disadvantages of a change of this nature against any advantages which may result in the easing of pressures on the Secretary of State and his Department. I am in no way critical—and I hope that no one who criticises the Amendment or refers to anything I have said in moving it will suggest that I am critical—of local authorities and their sense of responsibility. They are responsible bodies, and I have no doubt that they will seek to approach their duties under these provisions in a thoroughly responsible way. However, this provision is contrary to the principle that one party to a dispute should be the party which ultimately decides the issue, and I plead for the final decision to be taken by the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State obviously envisages circumstances in which this would be necessary and desirable, because it is provided for in Clause 9(3) which gives the necessary power. If it may be necessary in certain instances, that is half the argument in my favour and there is a case for arguing that it is desirable in all cases.</p>
	<p>Although these Amendments are grouped, a special argument can be put on Amendment No. 17 which deals with a power of a local authority to appoint the person to hear the inquiry. It would create the wrong image and the wrong impression if one party, which will ultimately decide the issue is also to be the party which nominates the judge to hear the argument. We would like to see, in issues of this nature, the person appointed, appointed independently of the local authority.</p>
	<p>It may be that in the fullness of time the appropriate body to decide an issue of this nature arising on a local plan would be a top-tier local authority responsible for the structure plan, and there is a big argument in favour of that, but till we have the machinery to set up the two levels of planning responsibility I strongly urge the Committee to leave the Secretary of State as the person with ultimate responsibility, because the public has in the independent judgment of the Secretary of State a confidence which even the most optimistic of us would not have in a local authority, being a party to the dispute.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find myself in agreement with much of what the hon. and learned Gentleman has said. The
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>240</span>
structure plan is of prime importance, and is subject to approval by the Secretary of State, but the local plan is not. The local plan provides the means for people who want to object to make a definite objection. That being so, if applicants wish to object, planning authorities will be the final arbiters. I am inclined to agree with the hon. and learned Gentleman that there must be some other method, and that perhaps it should be the Secretary of State. This seems right to me, since a tribute has been paid to the neutrality of the Secretary of State. Because the local plan is not produced at the same time as the structure plan, applicants will object to the structure plan on principle, in order to protect their interests. If they wait till the local plan is produced and make objections, those objections will be heard by the planning authority. This, to me, seems a weakness, which should merit the attention of the Secretary of State, to satisfy those who are being planned for. I would like some clarification of what will happen when a local plan is produced and objections are made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that both the hon. and learned Member for Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) and my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgeton (Mr. James Bennett) have read thoroughly the Planning Advisory Group Report, and I accept that they understand the sense of the Report, but it is clear that they do not believe all that much in change from the present system to the system we are proposing in the Bill. It is not easy to put this point clearly The present system does not have an emphasis on public participation. The present system makes no real attempt to have a proper dialogue between the planners and the planned, as the hon. and learned Gentleman put it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I interrupt myself here and say that the planners are not officials. They are officials and councillors, because no official can propose a plan with any validity unless it is supported by his councillors. Let us not think in emotive terms, that planners are officials in ivory towers who do not care a damn for the people outside. They are officials who help the council to formulate policies—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]—and if the hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) does not accept that he must have a peculiar difference in Dumfries. Policies are proposed by
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0949">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>241</span>
a local authority which consists of elected members. That is an essential fact of democratic government in this country. The planners are people elected by the community, and when the hon. and learned Member quotes the plan he means the people who put them there. That is basic to the democratic State, and we have prided ourselves on the strength of our democracy, not just here at Westminster, but at the level of local councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are trying to change the emphasis. As Benjamin Disraeli said, the Opposition are in favour of reform—the last reform, but not the next one, and it is with difficulty that one carries them on to the next reform. The next reform is plain. The recommendations of the P.A.G. Report make it clear that one reform is basic—that of public participation, which must be a fundamental part of planning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Member for Pentlands, who angered me in the early stages, casts doubt on the Government's sincerity. I hope I have sufficiently proved to him that the Government are showing their conviction that public participation is essential if this Bill is to work. I hope the Opposition will agree. I think the last debate—despite the vote which I regard rather as a manoeuvre than as a genuine expression of their view—was a demonstration that they wanted the public participation part of the Bill to work. If they do, it means that local councils will no longer be placed in the invidious position of defending planning of which the public know little. We are trying to get local councillors to respond to objections in the early stages, to listen to them and to modify plans accordingly, or to explain plans so that the objections will fall away. The intention of the Bill is to reduce the number of objections by persuasion and by a proper dialogue between both sides—as the hon. Gentleman calls it, the planners and the planned, the electors and the elected. That being so, much of the fear of autocratic action by local authorities which is aroused under the present system, and which, I accept, causes difficulty, and which is why we have this Bill, will go I would like to see change in the new system, but not all can be changed at once.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I may not be here on Tuesday, will the hon. Gentleman permit me to ask, does he accept that the recommendations of the Planning Advisory Group were greatly influenced by pressure of work at the centre in England and Wales, which is not a problem in Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not true. This is one of the distortions of the argument used outside by those opposed to the Planning Advisory Group. It is not an expedient to reduce pressure on the central planning departments, but it is right on its own merits because it separates the broad policy issues from local planning and puts it on the local authority best suited to deal with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are safeguards which are ignored by hon. Members opposite so far. The first is that the local plan under Clause 6(9) must conform generally to the structure plan which the Secretary of State will approve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the general plan will be subject to a public inquiry taken by an independent reporter, and I cannot believe that anybody will argue that, because the local authority will appoint the reporter, it will be appointing a partial reporter. The Secretary of State retains the power to control the selection of reporters. The judge and jury argument is basically a misconceived one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
