Is it not monstrous that the Government should get us to sit in the afternoon and then fail to provide a Quorum? Is this an example of how serious the Government are to get their business through? If they want to get their business through they should have enough of their supporters here to form a Quorum. On an earlier occasion we offered to sit in an afternoon, and the Government did not accept our offer on that occasion. Today we are here, and it is shocking that the Government cannot provide enough Members to keep the Committee going when we are so anxious to get the Bill through.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Dr. J. Dickson Mabon)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that we should be getting on, because we have already lost two afternoons in order to accommodate the Opposition. I do not wish to lose a third afternoon because of the absence of our Whip through illness, a fact which I am sure the Opposition do not wish to exploit. There is also other business in the House of Commons. It is rather unfair of hon. Members opposite to behave in this way when we were getting on so well and amicably. However, if they wish to destroy this amity, it is up to them, but the general public will notice who is destroying it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Robertson, I hope that you can prevent the Opposition from provoking me so unfairly. I will get on with answering the rather long speech from the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) as concisely as I can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point which he raised was a rather selective quotation from Cullingworth. I ask the Committee to be good enough to read recommendation 26. I will not go over all the preceding sections which lead to the recommendation. I prefer to concentrate on recommendation 26, which reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The percentage improvement grant should be increased to 75 per cent."</p></blockquote>
—which is what the Amendment says; but the recommendation qualifies that by adding:
	<br><blockquote><p>"if no provisions are made to enable the private landlord to charge a reasonable rent."</p></blockquote>
Later in the Bill, we are providing for that. It adds:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It should remain at the existing 50 per cent. if such a system is operated."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1288">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>263</span>
—which is, in fact, what the Bill proposes.
	<br><blockquote><p>"In either case, the maximum cost on which grant is paid should be significantly increased."</p></blockquote>
We are significantly increasing it from £500 to £1,200. Thus the whole of recommendation 26 is met by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recommendation 24 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We believe that the machinery set up under the Rent Act 1965, should be used in determining the rents of houses improved with grant aid."</p></blockquote>
We shall discuss that. Whether it is adequately dealt with is another matter; the hon. Gentleman was good enough to concede that. But the principle of applying the Rent Act 1965 is acknowledged in the Bill. I therefore submit that we have met the Cullingworth recommendations in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One final point which the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns mentioned was the impact of tax on a landlord's return. He recited the sections in Cullingworth dealing with that. We all know that the Cullingworth Report was published in January, 1967. It was considered by the Government and various interests—a large number were consulted—and in this Session of Parliament we are translating it into action. It has been quite expeditiously done but, nevertheless, Cullingworth is not quite up to date in this regard, although I believe that the position of the landlord has not basically changed. We have had the replacement of profits tax by corporation tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The detailed calculations made in the report, as such, are not in step with the present-day position. But the landlord is basically in the same position. He is still unable to set off, as an expense, either expenditure on improvements or expenditure on accumulated repairs, if the deterioration which made them necessary occurred before he acquired the property. This means that when a landlord borrows money to meet his share of the cost of a grant-aided improvement or of accumulated repairs associated with an improvement, the proportion of his rent income, which is set aside for capital repayments, counts as profit and is subject to income tax and
	<span class='label label-info column'>264</span>
corporation tax. The landlord in calculating his prospective return, therefore, adds the tax to his other expenditure and so requires a substantially higher rent return before undertaking the work than would otherwise be the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The property owners have suggested that a solution to their problem is a tax allowance for improvement expenditure on houses, on the lines of the depreciation allowances for expenditure on plant and machinery and industrial buildings. While I agree that this is not a Finance Bill and perhaps not the occasion to go into the matter fully, at least I ought to make acknowledgement of the fact that we have considered——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>And</i> The CHAIRMAN'S 	<i>attention having been called to the fact that ten Members were not present, he suspended the proceedings; and another Member having come into the Room, and ten Members being present, the proceedings were resumed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The objection to the property owners' suggestion is that an depreciation allowance is not appropriate for expenditure on the provision of houses which in general appreciate rather than depreciate in value over the years, and it is equally inappropriate, therefore, for expenditure on the improvement of houses since the asset represented by the improvement is equally likely to appreciate in value as time goes by. Even if it could be shown that a particular class of house or a particular class of improvement was depreciating in value, it would be wholly impracticable on administrative grounds to isolate such categories from the others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover depreciation allowances are not available for expenditure on the provision of buildings, except for the special cases—and they are quite clear cut—of industrial or agricultural buildings. The argument which has been put to us on behalf of the Treasury—and this is true of Treasury advice not only to the present Government but to past Governments—has been that it would be wrong in principle to make a distinction in favour of tenanted house property when commercial buildings similarly let as an investment would not be so favoured. It is on that ground that we find it difficult
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1289">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>265</span>
lords in support of this problem. I agree that it is a problem in certain cases, but it is very difficult to define these cases in law, or even to select these cases administratively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the way in which I would answer the argument on the Amendments strictly, that is to say about the figure of 75 per cent. We have sought to make the Cullingworth recommendation as viable in all its parts as we can. I am not saying that we have closed our minds completely to any possibility of seeking some way of meeting the genuine point of some property owners in relation to certain classes, but it has defied assessment by our advisers over many years and I should not like to seem to be entertaining hope that it will be an easy matter to solve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. G. D. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested in what the Minister said. He read with great clarity the interesting little Treasury brief which he had. But he is, after all, a practical politician, and it is no good his reading out all that stuff and explaining why it cannot be done, and why it is inappropriate to treat house landlords in one way and commercial landlords in another way. The fact of the matter is that commercial landlords can get a commercial return whereas the landlords of domestic rented property cannot. That is why we are having all this difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that this will be a successful Bill—he said that before lunch, and I hope that he is right—but I have grave doubts whether it will be very successful. I said on Second Reading that all Governments lack the guts to do the right thing about houses. I accept my own failure here, in the 1962 Act. We did not go nearly as far as I should have liked to go because we were frightened of the then Opposition, which did not behave in the responsible way in which the present Opposition behaves. I will say nothing about turning up on time and in larger numbers in case I provoke the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unless we are certain that the rent return will be adequate, the Amendment ought to be considered rather more seriously. The Minister is right that it is very difficult to consider whether it should be 50 per cent. or 75 per cent. unless we know what will be the return
	<span class='label label-info column'>266</span>
to meet the point put forward by land-on the rent. We shall come to that a little later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Glasgow, Scotstoun (Mr. Small) and West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) suggested that it was inappropriate that there should be an increase in Government expenditure from 50 per cent. to 75 per cent. I suggest to the Committee that it is entirely appropriate that there should be this increase, since it is only because of Government action in the past, restricting an economic return on the property, that the property ever fell into this condition. If, under the terms of the Clause, we do not make the increase to 75 per cent. or, alternatively, in relation to Clause 45, we do not see that there is a proper return on rent, I am afraid that this Bill, like so many of its predecessors, may turn out to be a dead duck.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful in many ways for what the Minister of State said about the principle of raising rents. I admitted, at the beginning of my argument, that while that point was important, the level of what we regard as a fair rent to show a fair return is a point to which we shall come later. I entirely accept that the Government have, in principle, implemented the recommendations of the Cullingworth Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I turn to the points which I raised in relation to the post-tax return to landlords. I am in one sense disappointed that the Minister, as my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith) said, raised so many technical difficulties in the way of resolving what I admit to be a difficult problem. However, he gave a glimmer of hope at the end by saying that he appreciated the need to give landlords a proper return to enable them to improve their properties and that the Government would continue to look at this problem to see whether there could be a way around it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said when moving the Amendment, it is most important that we should mobilise the resources of all those concerned in the provision or improvement of housing—not just the public sector against the private sector. If the landlords have a part to play—and I believe
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1290">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>267</span>
lems in Scotland we must, as Cullingworth says, be certain that they are granted the financial means to play their part. Until such time as we approach the whole question of post-tax return, as well as of rents, we are erecting a barrier against mobilising all efforts in that direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I return to the point of a 50 per cent. as opposed to a 75 per cent. grant. I must refute to some extent, as did my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Hillhead, the arguments of the hon. Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) in relation to yet another example of increasing Government expenditure. In this connection I reiterate what I said in my intervention just before the hon. Member for West Lothian finished his speech. One must bear in mind, in considering public expenditure on house improvement, that this is an investment which gives the local authority a return. I am not adducing my own arguments here but those of Cullingworth, who urged local authorities to take the view that money spent in house improvement is often brought back through a higher valuation and a higher return in the rates. The section quoted from Cullingworth this morning shows that there is a very good return to local authorities on money invested in this way. We must look at this whole question of the level of grants for improvement not just as a once-and-for-all payment of money but as an investment which generates income to the local authority. This is a very important factor to bear in mind when discussing the level of these grants. However, in view of the assurance which the Minister of State has given that he appreciates the point in Cullingworth—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Might I be permitted to reply to one or two points?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I should be delighted if the Minister would reply to one or two points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Robertson, you virtually asked us to discuss the Question, That the Clause stand part of the Bill, on the Amendments, and there are several points with which I want to deal. In defence of my hon. Friend the Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) who raised this matter, it is fair to point out
	<span class='label label-info column'>268</span>
that they have—in solving housing prob-that the Amendment would increased expenditure under the Bill from £3 million to £4frac12; million. That cannot be sneezed at. That is, after all, a substantial increase in expenditure. What my hon. Friend said was that the Opposition and, indeed, many other hon. Members including himself, occasionally asked for work to be done without recognising that it would cost the Treasury money. In these days when people are calling for cuts in Government expenditure, it is a little contradictory to appear to be asking for more money to be spent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and gallant Member for Bute and North Ayrshire (Sir F. Maclean) asked about building in remote areas, and he instanced Bute. I ought to remind him that Section 29(1) of the 1968 Act provides that a local authority may, with the consent of the Secretary of State, pay a higher amount than the normal maximum—and that is not tied, incidentally, to remote areas. The second provision of Section 29(1) recognises the special problems of houses of historic or architectural value.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an interesting point. Would the Minister of State say how often that provision has been used? Has it been used much by local authorities to assist in the kind of case raised by my hon. and gallant Friend or in relation to historic buildings?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is quite often used, but I cannot give figures off the cuff. The seven-eighths proportion of assistance given to local authorities from the Exchequer, which is in Section 35(5) of the Housing (Financial Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1968, is available only in the Highlands and Islands. Of course that is unaffected by the Bill. I concede the hon. and gallant Member's concern that Bute does not get this advantage. I am afraid that Bute has never been defined as within the Highlands and Islands, although that matter is certainly being considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should not like the Committee to go away with the impression that I am giving an assurance that we shall look into this, and do something about the question of preferential treatment to landlords as distinct from other forms of property entrepreneur, commercial or industrial. While the hon. Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith) is quite fair in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1291">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>269</span>
pulling my leg about a Treasury brief, I would explain that the reason I stuck to it was that it is a matter which has concerned the Treasury for some considerable time. As we all know, once we give a concession to one class of landlord it is very difficult to resist giving it to other classes of landlord. Hon Gentlemen opposite have had the same experience as we have. I must say I miss my hon. Friend, Mr. James McInnes, because he would "go to town" on me even for dreaming of suggesting that there was a way of giving preferential treatment of this kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning I stated that improvement grants are mainly—indeed, overwhelmingly—used by owner-occupiers. Landlords are not so far identified in this process as being willing to do this work. If James McInnes were here he would argue with me that until there was more evidence of that we should not go out of our way to help them. I admit that this is chicken-and-egg argument; if we help the landlords perhaps they would improve their property. But there is much feeling about the fact that landlords have never exhibited this desire in the past to improve their property. There are however one or two notable exceptions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How can they?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The wealthier landlords ought to set an example. The larger companies ought to set an example. I admit that the lady in Angus—and I specifically exempted the lady in Angus this morning in my remarks, although the hon. Gentleman did not recognise that—with one or two properties is the last person who could set an example. But the wealthier property owner certainly ought to try to do so. It would convince the Treasury more of the need to find a specification of a category of property which has peculiar difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I reject the Amendment. I gather that hon. Gentlemen are willing to have it withdrawn. If they wished to press it, I should say to my hon. Friends that we must reject it. We have met the prescription in Cullingworth of introducing a fair rent system—we shall debate that later. We have met the various recommendations which have been made by the Cullingworth Report, and I am confident that if the Report is met by
	<span class='label label-info column'>270</span>
the landlords in the same spirit as it has been met by the Government, this Bill can be translated into very good action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister keeps talking about this money going to the landlords. Of course indirectly it goes to landlords, but the object of the whole operation is to improve housing so that the tenants of the houses have decent accommodation in which to live. Unless one makes it worth the landlords' while, these people can get decent houses only by joining the local authority housing list, which is subsidised by the Government. I am glad to see the Minister nodding his head. We are anxious on this side of the Committee to make certain that the financial inducements are sufficient.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the Minister of State clear up one small financial point for me? If a local authority had to borrow money in order to be able to finance grants under this Clause, would such borrowing rank for the subsidy which is paid to a local authority for borrowing on the general housing account to bring the effective rate of interest down to 4 per cent.? I appreciate that that is perhaps a narrow point, but it is one which has considerable significance in the light of the current debate, in which the Chancellor is engaged, on the subject of the control of money supply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is "No". It is relevant to the discussion that is going on and to the concern of the Chancellor about the supply of money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith) dealt very well with the question of the return to private landlords. After all, we are aiming to improve housing as a whole in Scotland, and I support everything that my hon. Friend said on this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the Minister that there is to some extent a chicken-and-the-egg argument about persuading the landlord to invest in housing improvements. But unless at some stage it is put to the test we shall never know what is the result. Therefore, I urge the Minister not to forget about the argument on post-tax returns to the landlord but to continue an examination of it to see whether there
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1292">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>271</span>
is some way in which it can be resolved in order that we may mobilise all the housing effort that is available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that one of the reasons why we should exclude this type of expenditure from tax allowances was that the person with money in housing had an asset which was appreciating. I do not think that that was an entirely correct phrase to use. In some cases it is appreciating, but in other cases it is depreciating. It is to prevent the assets from depreciating that we want to encourage the landlord to improve his house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading I said that nobody with his money invested in anything wants to see that money or that asset depreciating; no one willingly wants to see his asset depreciating. That is why the whole basis of my argument is that, given the sufficient encouragement, landlords would co-operate and would use these improvement grants in the way in which we want to see them using those improvement grants. They would do that if they could honestly see that their asset was appreciating. That is the whole burden of my argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a very useful debate. The Minister has explained the Government's thinking. I know that he has given no specific assurance on this question of post-tax returns to landlords, and I urge him, before I withdraw the Amendment, not to forget our discussion. He spoke of the examinations which he has made of this Cullingworth recommendation in the past. I hope that it well may be a continuing examination to discover a way of assisting the landlords and thereby assisting the housing position in Scotland. I assure him that he will have our support if at a later stage he brings a proposal forward on this matter. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the Minister one or two questions concerning points which have been raised by Glasgow Corporation? It seems, according to the view of Glasgow Corporation, that because small houses—of which there are a great number in Glasgow; 76,000 of them—cannot be brought up to the proper standard they will be completely excluded. I should like to know whether the Minister will not reconsider that. I understand that it has been suggested to Glasgow that the right way to proceed is for them compulsorily to acquire these small houses—these room-and-kitchen houses, of which there are 76,000, and single-apartment houses, of which there are 17,000. If Glasgow Corporation compulsorily acquired these houses, it would cost £36 million. That seems to me a fantastic suggestion. It would be far better if these houses, in so far as they can be brought up to standard, were brought largely up to standard even though, because of their size, it is impossible to bring them completely up to standard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is looking confused. Perhaps I have not put the case very well. I thought that, possibly, he was aware of the representations which Glasgow Corporation have made and on which they have written a page or two, although I did not want to go into detail.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first Amendment provides a reference forward in subsection (1) of the Clause to subsection (7). Subsection (1) gives the circumstances in which the local authority must approve an application for standard grant and further provides that, if these circumstances are not met, they must refuse the application. In certain other circumstances, however, which the Committee will see set out in subsection (7), they have discretion to approve an application even if the requirements of subsection (1) are not met. Amendment No. 58, therefore, gives warning of this qualification as a help to the reader.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second Amendment, Amendment No. 60, alters the circumstances in which the local authority may pay standard grant when they are not obliged to do so. As the Bill is drafted they may, subject to directions from the Secretary of State, waive all the requirements of subsections (1) and (3) of the Clause. Under Amendment No. 60, they would be able to waive the conditions in subsection (3)—those relating to the future life of the house—but they may not waive the conditions under subsection (4), as applied by subsection (1), namely, the condition that the applicant must be the owner of the property.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing with the question of standard grants for house improvement.
	<span class='label label-info column'>274</span>
When we dealt with discretionary grants under Clause 37, we found that the consideration which has to be borne in mind of length of life of the house after the improvement had been carried out was changed from being a specific period, as under previous legislation, to being such period as would be decided by the Secretary of State before the house could be considered eligible for grant. This discretion is given to the Secretary of State on the discretionary grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have reached our discussion of standard grant. It is written into the Bill that the dwelling must be available for use for a period of not less than 15 years. My purpose in moving the Amendment is partly probing, in that I am not specifically tied to a period of seven years as opposed to the 15 years. I want to know why the Government have arrived at the figure of 15 years. Secondly, while I am not necessarily saying that seven years is the right substitute for 15 years, perhaps the 15-year period is rather long. Standard grant is more likely to apply than discretionary grant to houses of a relatively low life expectancy. It is often the provision of one of the facilities or one of the amenities described under the standard grant which helps to make life more tolerable in such a house before that house eventually comes up for demolition. It is the type of house with the lower life expectancy to which standard grants tend to be more applicable and more relevant than the houses to which discretionary grants are perhaps more appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On this general ground of principle—that standard grants are generally more relevant to houses of a lower life expectancy—perhaps this 15-year period is somewhat long. That is why I have suggested reducing it to a period of seven years. I am not tied to this number of years, but I should be interested to hear the Minister's arguments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The essential point, which the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) has not stressed enough, is the fact that this is a grant which the authority is obliged to give. The others are discretionary grants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that in our earlier discussion on Clause 37 my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Hugh D. Brown) read out a reference—I do not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1294">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>275</span>
say that he was supporting it—from the Chartered Land Societies' Committee (Scotland), on the same point, about the desirability of allowing improvement grants to properties with a life of less than 15 years. I was then urged, for contradictory reasons to try to give an answer regarding the number of years which we should assess in that case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment would extend the obligation of local authorities to pay standard grants. The hon. Gentleman is using this Amendment as a probing Amendment and I accept that. Our thinking on it is that if the life of the house is 15 years, then it is an obligation, and ought to be an obligation, to make these standard grants when they are applied for. When it is of a shorter period, it ought to be handled differently. In a very short period, let us say, of up to five years, the Committee will remember that we debated on Clause 8 of the Bill—what we might call the "patching Clause"—the separate powers which enable local authorities to assist limited works of improvement. So we are really talking of the properties within that difference, between the Clause 8 patching and the 15 years standard grants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that it is right and proper that local authorities should have discretion, but that that discretion should be guided by a handbook, which I referred to before, in which we shall indicate the kind of improvements that the Secretary of State thinks reasonable for houses with a short life. We shall try to give this guidance as clearly as we can, but without qualifying the discretion of the authority, because we readily recognise that authorities must be allowed to investigate all the circumstances so that they may judge the situation in the proper way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would not wish the hon. Gentleman to press this Amendment, because it would extend the obligation of local authorities. It would not be welcome to them; I know that. Glasgow Corporation may have got this situation slightly wrong in their Memorandum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In fact, Glasgow Corporation specifically asks for this to be reduced to seven years; it says that it has even more force with regard to standard grants—the very opposite argument to the one the Minister is using—
	<span class='label label-info column'>276</span>
than with regard to improvement grants, because it is the poor quality house that requires the standard grant, and the poor quality house usually has a short length of life available to it. So that Glasgow Corporation puts the case in exactly the opposite way to the way the Minister put it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think Glasgow Corporation misunderstood it, frankly. I think that as an authority, what it is virtually saying is that it should deny itself any discretion in this matter, and that any property owner in Glasgow who applies for a standard grant, without the qualification of 15 years, should automatically get it. That is really what it means. I can hardly believe that that is what the Corporation is advocating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two separate points here. We debated this on Clause 37. I think this is perhaps where the Corporation has got this slightly wrong. I think it would be quite wrong, and it would raise entirely different issues, if I were to reduce this figure from 15 to 7, as is suggested, or even from 15 to less than 15, for the reasons that I have tried to advance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry. I do not want to be difficult, but I am not very clear about the implications of what the Minister has said. I made it clear before that just because I have received representations, along with other Glasgow Members, I am not necessarily agreeing with them. The Minister has just made a very important statement. Are we now to assume that the local authority has some discretion in the event of property known to have an expected life of less than 15 years? If he is referring to Clause 8, that only applies to houses that are in a designated housing treatment area. We are not just talking about houses in a housing treatment area, as I understand it, when we are talking about standard grants. We are talking about old houses. I want it to be quite clear. What is the discretion, then, to the local authority which, for example, has property in a redevelopment area zoned to be cleared in 10 or 12 years? Is anyone in the area statute barred from making application for a standard grant? What is the area of discretion that he is suggesting the local authority will have?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1295">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>277</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bnchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I have understood the Minister rightly, what he is doing is to tie up this Clause more tightly, and because it is obligatory on the local authority to give the standard grant, there must be absolutely cut and dried conditions under which that grant can be applied for and given. I can appreciate the need for tightening it up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It does not entirely answer the argument which I put forward, reinforced by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith), in that it is often in this type of property, with a lower life expectancy, that the standard grants are particularly applicable. I beg to disagree with the Minister on that point. He was, in fact, saying—and perhaps he would confirm, when he replies, that this is right—that if the life of the property is less than 15 years, then in that case the decision shall be left to the discretion of the local authority and in that case the proper procedure is to apply for a discretionary grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, on the one hand, in order to keep the question of standard grant and the conditions of a standard grant cut and dried, he has the period of 15 years written into the Bill. Does he then mean that to meet difficulties of the kind we raised, the matter should be left to the local authority, through a discretionary improvement grant? A person in those circumstances, if his property has less than 15 years' life expectancy, should apply for a discretionary grant rather than for a standard grant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the standard grant is at a good deal lower standard than is the discretionary grant. Are not the improvements under a discretionary grant of a considerably higher standard? They are not the same. If that is so, it hardly seems sensible that the local authority should be able to give a higher discretionary grant, in respect of a higher standard, while denying the right to a standard grant at a lower standard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What concerns me about standard grants is that in relation to some of the standard amenities, there is a very small amount of grant. I am afraid that I have not had time to look up the parent legislation. But am I not right—and this carries on from the point raised by my hon. Friend the
	<span class='label label-info column'>278</span>
Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith)—in saying that there is a limit below which grant is given? Somebody may be needing something quite simple, such as a wash hand basin, and because the life of the house is less than 15 years, he will not get it as the Bill stands at the moment, and he will not be able to get it in the other way I suggested earlier, through an improvement grant, because the amount for which he is applying is too small.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under subsection (7), the local authority can give standard grant at their discretion, if the life of the house is less than 15 years. If it is more than 15 years, they must give a standard grant. If it is less than 15 years, they may give a standard grant. In either case, of course, they can give a discretionary grant. It depends on the circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that we do not wish to see public money being wasted, and I accept that that is the fear of some hon. Members in relation to the earlier matters which we discussed, when we made the provisions more flexible. I accept that. But we must try to give some guidance to the local authorities, and they are entitled, under subsection (7), to set aside certain of the requirements, provided that they comply with any general or specific direction which the Secretary of State may give.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With respect, we are talking of grants as of right in the case of standard grants for houses with over 15 years life. There is no question of discretion there. I accept the criticism which my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Hugh D. Brown) makes of my reference to Clause 8 in respect of the patching of houses, but I was giving it to demonstrate that there are houses which there is no intention of bringing anywhere near the standards envisaged either under standard grants or under discretionary grants. There is that distinction even lower down, so to speak, on the scale of improvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have made clear the differences there can be in the exercise of a local authority's judgment here and in their obligation to give grants for all houses whose life expectancy is over 15 years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that further explanation from the Minister. He certainly clarified the position. Whilst I appreciate that subsection (7) does specifically give the discretion—it is on a direction given by the Secretary of State—obviously it is the intention to give the local authority discretion in these cases to meet the very difficulties which my hon. Friend and I raised. In those circumstances, I have no intention of pressing the Amendment. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 42 provides that when a local authority decides not to approve an application for a standard grant, it may give reasons if the applicant so requests. This provision continues the practioe enshrined in existing legislation. My Amendment seeks to make a modest change for the better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Generally, local authorities dealing with housing, particularly when improving older property, are experts in legislation and know the rights of the citizen. We cannot afford to assume that the average person applying for a standard grant will know every detail of the Bill, even though there be, in small print on the application form itself, the provision that he may request reasons should a refusal be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Accepting this general viewpoint, we should make a change in the law so that the responsibility automatically lies with the local authority to provide the reasons if it feels justified in refusing a standard
	<span class='label label-info column'>280</span>
grant application. The onus should not be left on the applicant.

	<p>	<i>Question proposed, That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under Section 40(2) of the 1968 Act provision is made that part only of the standard amenities may be considered for grant where it is impossible to provide all the standard amenities on the grounds that it is impracticable at reasonable expense to provide them all. That is an eminently sensible provision. I raise one point in relation to this Clause. This point has been raised by Glasgow particularly in relation to small houses where there are only one or two rooms. Considerations of impracticability on grounds of costs do not necessarily arise because the real difficulty and hindrance in applying these improvements under the standard amenities is the physical limitation of space which prevents the inclusion of these amenities within the house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot accept what Glasgow Corporation said in their representations to us asking whether the provisions under Section 40(2) of the 1968 Act could go beyond the grounds of impracticability of expense and be extended to include considerations in relation to size of accommodation, structure of the house and so on. I appreciate that this introduces further considerations which may make the whole question of application of standard grants more difficult. At the same time—and this argument was raised earlier by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Hugh D. Brown)—if we

	<p>No. 151, in line 41, leave out 'repair' and insert 'condition'.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is acceptable to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Robertson. The point which I am putting forward is simple. I should like to ask the Committee to consider the circumstances which arise when a landlord applies for a qualifying certificate under which he may be able to get his rent from the tenant increased. In order to increase the rent, the landlord must satisfy the list of conditions set out in Clause 45(1). The landlord having applied for and been granted the qualifying certificate, it is then presented to the tenant. The tenant also has a right to check—when he knows that the landlord has applied for this qualifying certificate—whether these conditions have been fulfilled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have put forward the Amendment in practical terms because I think it very important that both the landlord and the tenant are absolutely clear, beyond peradventure, under which conditions a qualifying certificate may be applied for. If there is any doubt, if there are too many aspects where a subjective judgment may arise, that will lead to differences between landlord and tenant. It will lead to argument and discussion whether the proper procedure and proper conditions have been complied with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been represented to us that the list of conditions which has been set out in the Clause would have been better written out in full in certain circumstances. For example, we have the standards which are laid out in Clause 2(1) in relation to tolerable standards. All these standards were laid out so that people would be absolutely clear about their rights under which they had to operate the Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1298">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>283</span>
All that I have sought to do in my Amendment relates to standard amenities, in so far as they are not defined in the Bill. I have written in the reference—I hope that I have chosen the right one—so that people can refer to the precise definition of those standard amenities. A tenant who knows that application has been made for a qualifying certificate for the house in which he is living can look up the precise definition of these standard amenities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equally, an average tenant will have no idea of what is meant by a tolerable standard. I propose to write into the Clause a reference which he can look up to find what is the tolerable standard. Therefore, I have attempted in the two Amendments to write in, clearly and absolutely, the conditions under which a qualification certificate may be applied for in order to avoid difficulty arising during the course of the procedure which follows when a landlord applies for a qualification certificate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the reason for my doing it. I should have mentioned at the beginning that I would have thought that Amendment No. 151 might also have been included. It has exactly the same intention to be more specific. I do not intend to speak separately to Amendment No. 151, but I think that the word "condition" is slightly better than "repair" in the context of the Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason, therefore, behind my Amendment is to try to simplify the procedure and make it more readily understandable by the parties to the procedure. In that way, one would hope to make the procedure operate more smoothly and more sensibly. It is to improve the sense of the Clause that I have put forward the Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister should be grateful to me for exposing my ignorance, because I am sure that it is a big help to him. This is probably one of of the most important Clauses in the Bill and I am genuinely trying to find out whether I have understood it properly. It relates to the conversion of existing controlled tenancies of dwellings provided with standard amenities and in good repair. If I understand it correctly, this means that we are dealing with
	<span class='label label-info column'>284</span>
tenancies which are controlled at the moment but which, if they meet certain requirements, can become regulated tenancies, if that is the right language.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a letter from the Minister dealing with a specific case in which he mentions that one of the conditions will be the provision of a bathroom. I do not recollect hearing that mentioned anywhere else. This is a crucial point, particularly for Glasgow. Does this mean that although we are dealing with standard amenities and places in good repair, disregarding internal decorative repair, we are talking in terms of having a bathroom? This is an important point, because I wanted to raise with it the general question of the extent to which we can include the outside work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have the belief, although I should like to try to put it in more diplomatic language than the hon. Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith) does from time to time, that there is something in this contribution to social problems when we have people who are very concerned about their own piece of property, whether it be a council house or an owner-occupied house or a tenement flat, and who appear to be quite unconcerned about the state of what I describe as the communal facilities—the closes, the stairs, the back gardens and so on. The words are, "disregarding internal decorative repair", but since that will lead to argument, to what extent does the Minister see our being entitled to argue that the close is not done up or, in some cases, that the stairs and the steps are not maintained properly? Will that be covered? Will the owner or the landlord be required to do such repairs before the certificate is granted?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not dissent from the argument of the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) in support of Amendment No. 140. All I am saying is that on purely drafting grounds I think it unnecessary to make that Amendment. If we were to make that Amendment, we ought also to make an Amendment to Clause 46(2). It is better drafting practice to group definitions as is done later in Clause 57, the interpretation Clause of Part IV, by reference to Section 39(1) of the 1968 Act. In other words, I do not regard the arguments on Amendment No. 140 as any more than arguments of drafting
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1299">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>285</span>
neatness. I submit that the Bill, as drafted, is better than it would be if we made this Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 139 is even more difficult because if we were to make that Amendment, we should have to make Amendments to Clauses 4, 5, 10, 11, 13, 16, 17 and 42. I am sure that the Committee does not wish that to happen. Again, I do not disagree with the meaning of the Amendment; I am merely arguing that it is unnecessary because Clause 2(1) already gives meaning to the phrase "tolerable standard" for the purposes of the Bill. If the Committee will look at Schedule 6, paragraph 29, they will see that that brings the definition into the interpretation Section of the 1966 Act for the purpose of the Housing Acts generally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that whenever we discuss drafting the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) is anxious to make comments, but I hope to have his support on this point. I quite accept the Amendment as making clear the intention and, in this sense, it is to be welcomed. On the other hand, if a reference to Clause 2 were added here, it would have to be added also wherever there are references in the Bill to the "tolerable standard"; and I gave nine instances. I think that it would be impossibly complex drafting, and it would be much more satisfactory drafting and common practice to rely on Clause 2(1) as it stands without a cross-reference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take it that Amendment No. 151 is more than a probing Amendment, which I thought in the first instance it might be. The word "repair" is used in preference to "condition" because the phrase "internal decorative repair" is used already in the Rent Acts to describe what is meant in this Clause. For example, in paragraph 2 of Schedule 1 to the Rent Act 1957 and paragraph 2 of Schedule 4 of the Rent Act 1965 we have this reference. If new wording were to be introduced here, such as is suggested in Amendment No. 151, it would imply that a different meaning was intended from that in the Rent Acts. This, in the Government's estimation, is not so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the important point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Hugh D. Brown). If he looks at subsection (1) he will see laid down there the conditions which must
	<span class='label label-info column'>286</span>
be satisfied before the local authority can issue a certificate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns asked me about this list of conditions. There is power to prescribe the forms of qualification certificates and so on, so that detailed information would be given to the party. This power derives from Clause 56 which applies the Rent Act powers in Section 46 of the Rent Act, 1965.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked about bathrooms. The house must have all the standard amenities, one of which is a bath in a bathroom. The standard amenities are a fixed bath or shower—there are qualifications to that which I will not mention just now—a wash-hand basin, a sink, a hot and cold water supply at bath, wash-hand basin and sink, and a water closet. I will not go into the other aspects such as good repair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked about the internal decoration of the stairs. The internal decoration to be disregarded for conversion purposes is internal to the dwelling. It does not refer to the state of decoration of the close or the stairs. This means that a badly-maintained close could deny the landlord access to the provisions in Part IV.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a very important Clause. But we should take it piece by piece. We have many Amendments to deal with in Clause 45. Let us take them as they arise, rather than be dragged into a "Clause stand part" discussion. May I say, with respect to the Committee, that we should not do what we did last time, which was to take the Motion, That the Clause stand part of the Bill, on one Amendment, particularly when considering these Amendments. Let us take this Clause Amendment by Amendment. We can group them. But let us not get bogged down in a general discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will content myself with saying that Amendment No. 140 is unnecessary on drafting grounds. I do not disagree with the principle. Amendment No. 139 is the same. It is good in principle, but it has drafting defects. Amendment No. 151 raises a different issue. I do not think we ought to make the Amendment because it would arouse doubts about the meaning of this phrase in the Rent Act. We in the Government would disagree with that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to delay the Committee, but I was rather worried by one comment which the Minister made. I am not sure that this is the right place to discuss it, but he said in passing—if I understood him aright—that a badly maintained close would deny the landlord access to the transformation of the tenancy into a regulated tenancy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. If the debate goes wide, the Chair will be put in an impossible position. These are very narrow Amendments. We want to keep them narrow. The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will accept your Ruling, Mr. Robertson. The Minister of State raised this point and I should like to return to it before we leave the Clause. There are difficulties about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. N. R. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Robertson, as you rightly point out, these are narrow Amendments. They are purely drafting Amendments, as the Minister said. I believe that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Hugh D. Brown) widened the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We readily accept what the Minister said about Amendment No. 151. We were not familiar enough with the rent control legislation and the housing legislation to appreciate that the term "internal decorative repair" is a standard term. If that is the case, as the Minister has said it is, clearly it ought not to be changed. Looking at it for the first time, one would have thought that "condition" was a better way of describing decorative state than "repair".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that Amendments Nos. 140 and 139 are unnecessary. My hon. Friend fully appreciates that. It is always difficult to know when is the moment to write in a reference, albeit that it is not strictly necessary. I agree with everything the Minister has said about this matter, but the Clause is so important that it would not be an abuse of language to make the Amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend proposes merely an on-the-spot reference, as it were, first to the earlier statutory provisions about standard amenities. Although, as the Minister has pointed out, the expression is defined in Clause 57, it is not defined
	<span class='label label-info column'>288</span>
in the general definition Clause. It would be helpful to the public to have the reference in the Clause with which the public, landlord or tenant, will be intimately involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They are not necessary Amendments, but on the whole I am inclined to come down on the side of making them. The term "tolerable standard" is used repeatedly in the Bill. There may be more force in the argument that it is better not to make a specific reference to Clause 2 in this subsection when no such reference is made elsewhere, except that once again this is a Clause which will be crucial, as the Minister himself said. Although not strictly necessary, these Amendments may be helpful. However, no doubt my hon. Friend will make up his own mind whether to withdraw or press them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. Mr. Robertson. You gave a Ruling to the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Bruce-Gardyne) about references to a close. Would not such references be covered by the words "age, character and locality"?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How best may this subject be raised if you rule that it is not in order now? It will be difficult to discuss it and remain in order even when we discuss the Clause as a whole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A point of order does not arise. These are narrow drafting Amendments and should be discussed as such. There will be plenty of opportunity for hon. Members to go as wide as the Clause will allow, either on a later Amendment or in the Clause stand part debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will briefly acknowledge that the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Bruce-Gardyne) heard me aright. The internal decoration to be disregarded for conversion purposes is internal to the dwelling. It does not refer to the state of decoration of the close, or the stairs which are not the tenant's responsibility. Therefore, it means that a badly maintained close could deny—perhaps I should have stressed the word "could", because it depends on the circumstances—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have already ruled on this subject. The Amendment is to leave out the word "repair" and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1301">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>289</span>
insert the word "condition". Hon. Members should keep to the Amendment and not enter a wide discussion of the meaning of "decorative repair" and "decorative condition".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not want to offend you in any way, Mr. Robertson. It is difficult to find a hook on which to hang this argument about internal decorative repair. I agree that my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Hugh D. Brown) could have raised this issue later, but I used the phrase "internal decorative repair" in acknowledging the word "repair" in the alteration in Amendment No. 151. But I shall hastily leave that matter in the hope that I have satisfied all hon. Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. I do not want to make further difficulties, but the Minister of State said that he hopes that he has satisfied all hon. Members. He has not satisfied me and I hope that I shall be given the opportunity to raise this important issue later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order. I assure the hon. Gentleman that these are narrow, drafting Amendments concerning whether certain definitions should appear in the Clause or in other parts of the Bill. I shall not allow discussion of these Amendments to go wider than that. There will be plenty of opportunity later for wider debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I owe you an apology, Mr. Robertson, for the fact that my simple Amendments have provoked such controversy about the rules of order. I trust that I shall keep within the bounds of order in what I say about them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept what the Minister of State said about Amendment No. 151. Obviously, as there is a legislative precedent for the words "internal decorative repair", it would be silly to change them. However, like my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie), I am still not entirely happy about the Minister's refusal to accept Amendments Nos. 139 and 140 which attempt more specifically to fill out exactly what is required when applying for a qualification certificate. But at least the Minister of State has accepted the principle of the Amendments. I am
	<span class='label label-info column'>290</span>
trying to bring together all the ends of these references elsewhere to simplify the procedure when a qualification certificate is applied for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the handbook of guidance would provide for the list of conditions under which a qualification certificate could be applied for to be supplied to the tenant as well as to the landlord. If this list of conditions is supplied to the tenant, the specific references will be included, so the tenant may know exactly where he stands. This would meet the point of general principle, for if the tenant is given a list of these conditions, he can see at once whether his dwelling complies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On that understanding, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 147 is not selected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A few moments ago the Minister described Clause 45 as one of the crucial Clauses. I respectfully agree with him. Subsection (2) begins with a statement which is positively misleading. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The tenancy shall become a regulated tenancy on the issue of the certificate "—</p></blockquote>
then follows the disjunctive part—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(unless the tenancy has then become a regulated tenancy apart from this Act"—</p></blockquote>
presumably a change of tenancy or something like that—
	<br><blockquote><p>"or has ceased to exist) on such later date as is specified in Section 51".</p></blockquote>
I am glad that you have included Amendment No. 165, Mr. Robertson, because these Amendments hang together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 51 provides that where a qualification certificate with respect to a dwelling is issued before the date later specified, the existing controlled tenancy will not become a regulated tenancy until the appropriate date. The Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but as far as I can see the tenancy can never become a regulated tenancy on the issue of a certificate prior to the dates or date specified in Clause 51(2).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The operation of this change is being postponed till July, 1971, or January, 1972. The issue of a certificate can be made before that date, and I think rightly so, because if we are to spread the load of this operation, this is the kind of work that has to be done in advance of those dates, or there will be a long jam thereafter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As far as I can see, and again the Minister will correct me if I am wrong, until a tenancy becomes a regulated tenancy, no preparatory provisions or proceedings may be taken with regard to the assessment of the rent. In other words, if we accept that no tenancy can become a regulated tenancy on the issue of a certificate, despite the opening words of subsection (2), before the date specified in Clause 51, and if proceedings for the assessment of the fair rent cannot be undertaken until we have a regulated tenancy, there will be an unnecessary delay in the assessment of the fair rent under the regulated tenancy provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>292</span>
Schedule 3(1) of the 1965 Act provides that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"An application for the registration of a rent for a dwellirtghouse may be made to the rent officer by the landlord or the tenant, or jointly by the landlord and the tenant, under a regulated tenancy of the dwellinghouse ".</p></blockquote>
That appears to suggest that until one has a regulated tenancy, one cannot apply to the rent officer to assess the rent. That is subject to the qualification that there are powers in Section 11(3) of the 1965 Act, powers which so far have not been exercised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems that just as it is desirable to anticipate these statutory dates with regard to the issue of a qualification certificate, and the necessary investigations involved, so it would be desirable and in the interests of the tenant that proceedings could be taken to assess the rent which will become payable under the regulated tenancy when the statutory dates apply. It is desirable that these investigations and these proceedings should be instituted in advance of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say that it is in the interests of the tenant because when a change of this nature is being made, it is only right that the tenant should know what is to happen. He ought not only to know that he is to have a regulated tenancy but also what the rent under that tenancy is to be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I confess that I find this Clause extremely confusing in its wording. Do I understand my hon. and learned Friend to say that the purpose of his Amendments is solely to ensure that the procedures for assessing the regulated rent are gone through before the operative date under Clause 21 as opposed to the application of the regulated rent before the operative date?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. These Amendments would result in subsection (2) reading as follows:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… the tenancy shall become a regulated tenancy on the issue of the certificate or (unless the tenancy has then become a regulated tenancy apart from this Act or has ceased to exist)".</p></blockquote>
That is to say that when the certificate is issued, the tenancy becomes a regulated tenancy, and as I understand the existing statutory provisions, that being the case it is then possible under the provisions of the 1965 Act to get the rent assessed. But
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1303">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>293</span>
in order to preserve the spirit of this legislation, which is to withhold the operation of the new rent until the date specified, Amendment No. 165 is intended to safeguard the position there—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a question of policy which I do not want to discuss at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the Amendment which I am moving is, first, to create a regulated tenancy on the grant of a certificate and, secondly, under Amendment No. 165, to suspend the operation of the new rent which has been assessed until the date specified in subsection (2) Amendment No. 165 reads as follows:
	<br><blockquote><p>"'Where a tenancy has become a regulated tenancy by virtue of section 45(2) of this Act the rent payable under the regulated tenancy shall not exceed the rent payable under the preceding controlled tenancy until the appropriate date specified in subsection (2) of this section'."</p></blockquote>
There may be a difference of opinion whether the operation of this change should be suspended until January, 1971. A cynical person might say that these provisions are to withhold the operation of these changes until a Conservative Government takes over, presumably to incur the criticism of the change. I do not suggest that that is the intention behind it. I merely said that a cynical person might take that view. I do not think that it is so. I think that there has to be a transition period, and we accept the delay specified in Clause 51, though we say that there is no reason at all why the assessment of the fair rent ought to be barred before January, 1971, because if everything is left until that date or thereafter there will be a great pressure of work on the rent officers—of whom there are far too few at the moment—who could not possibly cope with the volume of work which will be given them under this legislation. But it would ease the pressure and strain if this aspect of the operation were dealt with in advance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the intention of these Amendments. They may not be technically correct, but it would be useful to know the Minister's views and, in particular, if he is not prepared to accept them in principle, why he wants to withhold the reassessment of rent which follows from a
	<span class='label label-info column'>294</span>
regulated tenancy once it has been brought about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I confess that I have some reservations about the Amendments which my hon. Friend has moved—Amendment No. 165 in particular—and I will try to explain why. I am concerned—as the Minister of State knows, and I have already made plain during the course of to-day's discussions—with the position of the small landlord who, certainly in my constituency, has been receiving a derisory rent. I will demonstrate in a moment what I mean by a derisory rent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State said earlier this morning that he thought this was a problem unique to Angus. I am delighted if this is so, but I find it very hard to believe that the sort of situation which I encounter, day in, day out, week in, week out, in my own constituency does not occur in other parts of Scotland. I think that I have one or two Amendments which are being taken in this group, and I want to make it clear that the one which, in a sense, appeals to me most is Amendment No. 148. It may leave much to be desired in drafting, but its purpose, in case it is not immediately plain, is to ensure that in the case of the small landlord—and the figure which I have used, which I freely accept must be very much open to debate, is the landlord in receipt of less than £300 per annum in aggregate rental from tenanted property—these people should at least be entitled to receive the regulated rent for properties which already come up to the prescribed standard and are, therefore, embraced by the ambit of Clause 45 immediately on the passage of the Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to give the Committee one instance among many which have been brought to my attention. I think it typical of the sort of injustice—and it really is a crying injustice—which has been committed against some of these people for a great many years. This concerns three elderly spinster ladies aged 67, 70 and 74. They are the landlords of some tenanted property in Arbroath. The tenanted property consists of three flats. Each flat has three large rooms plus a large kitchenette, besides a bathroom, a toilet and a cellar, and is, of course, completely equipped with hot
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1304">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>295</span>
and cold running water. In other words, this is the sort of property which, clearly, comes within the definition of property which ranks for transformation into a regulated tenancy under the terms of Clause 45.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rent which they are receiving for this property is the equivalent of rather less than two packets of cigarettes per week—£24 12s. per annum for two of these flats, and the rent is £22 18s. per annum. This is in a burgh where it is not unknown for furnished accommodation to be let at a rent of £4 a week. I should add that these flats were built in 1938, and they are in excellent standing and condition. As I have said, these elderly ladies are currently aged 67, 70 and 74. They are old-age pensioners. Apart from the minimal income which they receive from this property—which is more than offset by the cost of maintaining the property at the present cost of repairs—they have no other form of income apart from their old-age pensions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it is totally unacceptable that people in this situation should have to wait until 1971 or 1972 until they are allowed to receive what, in the words of the 1965 Act, was described as a fair rent for this admirably maintained and admirably built property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why, for myself, I am not prepared to support the proposition that people in this situation should have to wait until 1971 or 1972. Of course, I accept that, in the case of a substantial landlord with a large amount of property in Glasgow or elsewhere, this may well be a reasonable proposition to make. I am bound to say that I am not quite sure that I would be quite so charitable as my hon. and learned Friend in his attribution of motives to the Government on the question of timing. Be that as it may, I can certainly say that, in the case of a substantial landlord with a large number of properties with a substantial rent roll, it is not unreasonable to say that, having waited for so long to get a reasonable, modern rent on properties of the kind that we are discussing this evening, they should wait another two years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of these three elderly ladies with no other form of income, apart from their old age pensions, I submit that it is not reasonable that they should
	<span class='label label-info column'>296</span>
be expected to wait for another two or three years. I therefore hope that, when the Minister of State comes to reply, he will accept either my Amendment No. 148 in terms, or will agree to accept an Amendment, which maybe would be better drafted, which would have this effect. I think that a grave injustice has been perpetrated on these people for many years. Now is the opportunity, at long last, to put that injustice right, and I do not think we should wait another two or three years to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know the old legal adage that hard cases make bad law, but I readily admit that the cases which the hon. Gentleman cited this morning, and which I incidentally emphasised this morning, have the Government's sympathy. We are doing something about it. I do not wish to drag too many partisan arguments into this debate but, after all, the Rent Act, 1957, was on the books for seven years before the party opposite demitted office, and these wretched ladies, placed in this terrible position, with whom I fully sympathise, had not a glimmer of hope of anything being done under the 1957 Act. Indeed, we were told categorically in 1963 that there would be no further decontrol under the 1957 Act, which meant that they had to wait until the tenancies were changed, by the tenant either dying or going away, before they ever became decontrolled and were able to increase the rent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I do not think it lies with the hon. Member to chastise us for the situation as it presently stands. What I am saying to him—and he can tell his constituents this—is that the Government have to decide the practical ways of going about matters, and we feel that we have to choose which we will do first, which we will bring into rent regulation first—the houses that we want to see improved, or the houses that are already in the condition satisfying the circumstances of the Bill. I suggest to the Committee—and I would like them to think about this very carefully—that if the Government have to make a choice, then the choice ought to be in favour of bringing into rent regulation those houses that we (are seeking to have improved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie), when
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1305">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>297</span>
he was arguing his case, said that a house can never become regulated on the issue of the qualification certificate, and that is true in relation to houses which already meet the qualification conditions and to which the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Bruce-Gardyne) referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Incidentally, I cannot confirm all the details that he gave me, but I take his word for it that these houses already do meet the qualifying conditions. It is true. But postponement in Clause 51 applies only to those houses which already meet the qualifying conditions. A house which is to be improved becomes a regulated tenancy immediately upon the issue of the qualification certificate, and I suggest to the Committee that that is the right priority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the situation with regard to rent officers, I may say that we have had criticisms from time to time; I have no wish to appear cynical; I will join the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) in that. Some cynics say that there are far too many civil servants and that there ought to be a determined attempt to cut down their number. At the moment we have 23 rent officers, 10 part-time. We maintain that we have a force in Scotland equivalent to 16frac12; full-time staff. In 1968 they made 4,936 determinations, about 300 per officer or six cases a week. In addition, we recently had an inspection by staff inspectors of the Civil Service Department which showed that optimum output of a city rent officer was about 500 cases a year and that correspondingly lower figures applied to rural and part-time rent officers, to give us an average. Rural rent officers have longer journeys, and it is more inconvenient for them to go through the six principal stages which a rent officer has to undertake to carry out his task properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is machinery which both parties should endorse. If we have a Conservative Government, which I hope we do not, I hope they will look at the machinery and realise how fair it is. The rent officer examines the application to ensure that it qualifies for registration and that all the information he requires is provided. The second stage is that the rent officer notifies the other
	<span class='label label-info column'>298</span>
party to the application, giving him at least seven days to make representations. At the third stage, the rent officer may have to ask either or both of the parties for further information, and again he must allow them seven days to reply. The fourth stage is the rent officer's inspection of the house, by arrangement with the tenant. The fifth stage is the arrangement of a meeting with the landlord and the tenant. Again, he must give seven days notice in order to secure the meeting. The sixth and final stage is the rent officer's determination of the rent. He then gives the parties 28 days in which to appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our rent officers do very well for Scotland. They work very hard. The backlog of cases is not very large at the moment. Over the whole country it stands at about 2,000 and they are nearly all due to the very complex difficulties arising from large groups of houses, like Coal Board houses, or Atomic Energy Authority houses at Thurso and Chapel-cross, and so on. I acknowledge that there is a small backlog in Edinburgh. That is due to the large scale of single ownerships.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am making this point to the Committee because I believe we have the right number of officers. They are working well and processing the applications very well. It is right, if we have to take the option, that the option ought to be in favour of saying to the landlord who is about to improve his property that he should not worry that the minute it is done it will be taken out of control and changed to regulated tenancies thereafter. Ultimately we intend to have regulated tenancies covering the whole field.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is true. In Scotland the cost is about £8 a case. In Scotland the clerical staff is shared with the Rent Assessment Panel because the rent officer in Scotland is the Secretary of State's officer, whereas in England the local authority are responsible for this. Taking the share of the cost of the Rent Assessment Panel, which I am not discussing at the moment, the cost per case is still below £10. I believe that in England it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1306">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>299</span>
runs at about £20. I take my hon. Friend's point. It is a service, but it is a service that endeavours to give the best judgment and fairness to both tenant and landlord.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the Minister let me put that in a proper perspective? In a way it is a service, but it is a necessary service only because of the existence of the Rent Act, so it is proper that it should be paid by the taxpayer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to get dragged into these arguments. The Amendments which the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands has put down here, Nos. 152, 153, 154 and 165, are all admirably drafted; I have no criticism to make on that score. It is highly exceptional for him to draft a bad Amendment, although he has done it on some occasions when he has not slept well!
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In relation to Amendment No. 148, the hon. Gentleman meant to exclude landlords from the delay, but what his Amendment does is to deal with landlords excluded from conversions to rent regulation; that is not what he meant. In other words, Amendment No. 148 ought not to be pressed to a Division, because if it were included, it would not achieve what he means to achieve by it. I do not make much of that point, but we really cannot make this Amendment. What the hon. Gentleman says in justifying it does not make any sense at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, I think that if the choice has to be taken—and I believe that there has to be a choice—we are right in choosing those landlords who are seeking to improve their properties as being the ones who merit processing to rent regulation first. That may sound unjust to some degree, but I would point out to hon. Gentlemen opposite that they have been responsible for this injustice for a far longer period than we have. We are seeking to change this as soon as we can, once we get over this initial load of work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First of all, I am afraid I could not follow what the Minister of State said by way of objection to the drafting of my Amendment No. 148. I fully accept that it may not achieve the purpose that it is designed to achieve, but I am bound to say that, from what he said, I could not follow why it would
	<span class='label label-info column'>300</span>
not achieve the purpose that it was designed to achieve. He is, at least, clear about the purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that we must stop this parrot cry that we hear regularly from the Minister of State to the effect that this side of the Committee has been responsible for a longer period of injustice to the sort of landlords on whose behalf I was speaking than hon. Gentlemen on the other side of the Committee. There is one reason why this situation has been allowed to exist for so long. I regret it and I criticise the fact that it has been allowed to exist for so long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the reason was that, if the last Conservative Government had attempted to put right his situation, just imagine the screams and yells that would have gone up, not perhaps from the Minister of State himself because, to give him some credit, even in his earlier dispensation to which he will return shortly, he has shown a certain degree of responsibility in these matters. But consider what the hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton) would say; consider what the Secretary of State would say if a Tory Government had taken action to deal with these injustices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish that we had been more determined in facing up to the utterly irresponsible and rabble-rousing criticism that we have received from the other side of the Committee, but I can well understand the difficulty that we encountered at that time. I wish that I could be more confident that, even if we passed these Clauses in the form which the Government propose, when the day comes in 1971 or 1972 and hon. and right hon. Gentlemen opposite have been cast into outer darkness, we should not get the same parrot cries all over again from people like the hon. Member for Fife, West, and the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will forgive me, he must admit that there is a change in the situation to this degree: we now have a fair rent system which, so far as I am aware, is accepted by all parties. I have never seen a landlord's submission arguing that we should withdraw the Rent Act, 1965. I have not seen anything from the Party opposite. My hon. Friends and I have found objection to the 1957 Act because it made no attempt to get arbitration on rent between landlord and tenant. Let us stop
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1307">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>301</span>
the party arguments about this. Let us now accept the 1965 Act as an excellent Act and try to get it extended as soon as we can.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us by all means stop the party arguments, but let us hear no more from the Minister of State with these crude attempts to apportion blame on a date basis without any regard for the factors lying behind the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main point in the reply of the Minister of State, which I cannot let pass, is this argument that we should give priority to the tenancies that are to be repaired—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Improved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: —under the subsequent Clauses which we are still to discuss. I can see that there might appear to be a certain logic about this, that presumably the argument would be that the properties which are affected by Clause 45 are already in good repair and therefore unlikely to deteriorate, whereas the properties which stand to be improved subsequently may well deteriorate unless they are handled rapidly. But how long does the Minister of State think these improvements are going to take and what are the rent officers going to be doing while these improvements are being made?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Are we seriously to believe that it is not possible for the provision to be made? I am only asking. All I ask is for the cases of the small landlords of the type to which I have been referring to be given special dispensation, to be given the benefit of the fair rent forthwith, on the passage of this Bill. The numbers really cannot be very great. The Minister of State said this morning that the sort of cases I have in mind occur only in Angus. If they occur only in Angus, then clearly, by definition, there can be very few of them. Are we really to accept—because I do not for one moment—that it is impossible for the rent officers to deal with this sort of case while the repairs, the improvements, on other properties under the later Clauses of the Bill which we have yet to discuss are being carried out?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not see why we should make any sort of order of priorities such as the Minister of State has suggested. Take
	<span class='label label-info column'>302</span>
the position of landlords on a very small scale, within a fixed limit. I do not mind whether it is 300; it might even be 200 or perhaps 400 a year, but landlords with a very small number of properties and a very small rent income. The numbers must be so modest that I just do not accept that the rent officers, as at present established, could not deal with these cases before they have to deal with what, frankly, I do not think will be an enormous flood of cases following improvement under the subsequent Clauses of this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am bound to say that I am not satisfied by the Minister of State's arguments. I ask him to look at the case again. I believe that we can deal with both these matters at the same time, and I believe that if we want to remedy a long-standing injustice, leaving aside all the apportionment of blame for this long-standing injustice, and we want to do it as soon as possible, we can do so. I urge the Minister of State to think again and accept that we can indeed rectify this here and now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Robertson. Do you expect that we shall be able to have a debate on the Question "That the Clause stand part"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the way that the debate has developed on this series of Amendments, I would not think that there would be a discussion on the Question "That the Clause stand part".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order. This puts us in a certain difficulty.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No point of order arises. I have warned hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That places certain members of the Committee in a difficult position. I had not intended to take part in this debate, but, on the other hand, I do want to say something on the Clause which could be related to this debate. I would rather wait for the debate on the Clause stand part, but if by doing so I lose the chance to say what I want to say, then obviously I must link it to this debate. This places me in a difficult position. If, Mr. Robertson, you could possibly allow a short debate on the Clause stand part it would be of general help to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are a little previous in considering whether or not there should be a discussion on the Clause stand part.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the Minister has not yielded on what I regard as an important point of principle here. It is manifestly unjust that a landlord whose property satisfies the necessary conditions is to be held back, when it comes to the assessment and operation of a fair rent, because the landlord whose properties fall short of that condition are put in a preferred position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not advancing the date at which the new rent takes effect. We accept the 1971–1972 dates. All we asked is that assessment of that rent should be obtained in advance, (a) to make sure that it will operate on the appropriate date, and (b) to relieve pressure of work on the rent officers concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must ask my hon. Friends to press this Amendment to a Division, if necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I obviously have not persuaded hon. Gentlemen opposite, because I have explained my position and that of the Government. I thought that the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh. Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) was fully aware of the transitional nature of the problem facing us, and I cannot believe that the Opposition have not grasped the fact that
	<span class='label label-info column'>304</span>
everything cannot be done at once. If it is the argument of the Opposition that everything can be done at once, it is of course perfectly logical for them to press for a Division.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall return to limited Amendment No. 148 in a moment, since I have not explained properly to the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Bruce-Gardyne) the reason why his Amendment is technically defective or, for that matter, why I cannot select from within those categories not being applied at once any one category. For the present, I shall return to the general positon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not follow the arguments of the Opposition about everything being done at once. I thought I had taken considerable trouble to give information to the Committee on the volume of work done by rent officers. I have not heard the argument advanced that we should increase the number of rent officers, nor do I think that that would necessarily deal with the situation. There is an optimum effect of rent officers, and having a larger number does not mean that the processing can go much faster. I agree that it would go slightly faster, but it does not mean that we should either get value for money or get this load of work done any more quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pointed out to the Committee, and perhaps some hon. Members took it as an argument in their favour, that there is little backlog of work at present in terms of regulated tenancies. They may say that that is an argument in favour of going ahead. But the essential point is that the rent officer has to work on the improvement cases before the work of improving the house is done, so that he is an essential part of the whole process of convincing the landlord that it is useful for him to do this work. The rent officer is brought in before any change is made and therefore he is in at the starting point where a certificate of fair rent is given on the basis of the improvement proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Opposition believe that all these things can be done at once, I feel, with respect, that they should answer the argument which I have put. I demonstrated the six essential stages. I gave the number of officers we have and what they do. I have given the number of cases
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1309">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>305</span>
which they have processed, how frequently they do them and the cost of doing them. I have demonstrated that with the inspection team the system is working well, and economically. After doing that, surely I deserve some explanation from the hon. and learned Gentleman of his system and how it will operate better than mine. Apparently he deserted that position when he admitted that there had to be a transitional stage. He dismissed the voices of cynicism which he had heard from the political commentators in the Press, and agreed that there was a transitional stage. In that event, the argument shifts to the question of priorities. Have I got my priorities wrong?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the hon. Gentleman does not expect me to believe that the Minister would hold the operation of this legislation back until the next Conservative Government came into office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The hon. and learned Gentleman himself dismissed that as being an improper and thoroughly disgraceful contention. He was not arguing that. He brushed the mud off his clothes about that and disowned it completely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must be arguing the practicability of this proposal. If the hon. Gentleman agrees with me that all cannot be done at once, that there is a transitional period, then he must face the argument, which he is not facing, about priorities. Have the Government got their priorities right?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's priority here is that we should take the rent officer machinery and tie it to the improvement grant system so that it is part and parcel of the incentives. We provide many incentives. We have improved standard grants, we have improved discretionary grants, and we intend to embark on a great propaganda exercise to convince landlords of the wisdom of improving their properties—and we expect hon. Gentlemen opposite to join us in that exercise. If we are doing all that, surely we are right in integrating the rent officer system so that we say to the landlord, "By the way, we shall be able, right at the beginning, to let you assess what your certificate of fair rent will be on the basis of improvement proposals".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Presumably the hon. and learned Gentleman intends to demolish that argument. He will rise, after I sit down, and
	<span class='label label-info column'>306</span>
say, "I agree with the Minister. There is a transitional period. All cannot be done at once. But you are all wrong. Landlords will not need to have an incentive to improve their properties. They are all bursting to do it, and they are willing to stand in the queue and to let the properties which are presently of a high standard and which qualify here be rent-regulated first of all".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If he convinces me and the Committee of that, I am very willing, indeed, to look again at the priorities. I will go to the Secretary of State tomorrow and put the case to him which the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands has proved successfully to me and to the Committee—the case that we have our priorities wrong, that the landlords need no more incentives to improve their properties because they intend to do it anyway, and that what we ought to do is to redress the injustice of 40 years of rent restriction, including all the years during which hon. Members opposite were in power, and some of our years of office, too. If that is the case which we are to hear, I will gladly give way to the hon. and learned Gentleman so that he may prove it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruee-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understood the Minister of State to say that he would give us a clear explanation of why Amendment No. 148 was unacceptable. Why could he not make the sort of distinction which I asked him to make? He did not do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise. In my earnest endeavour to bring the proceedings quickly to a conclusion, I forgot to acknowledge the point made by the hon. Member.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is very difficult to select a class of landlord, which the hon. Member attempts to do in his Amendment. In fact, as I suggested to him, his Amendment is drafted to achieve the wrong aim. I think I am right in saying that the hon. Member meant to exclude the landlords referred to from the delay, not from the conversion. If he looks closely at Clause 45, at the preceding page 27, and reads the whole Clause together with his addition to line 1 on page 27, he will see that, in fact, he does not achieve what he wants to achieve namely, the exclusion of landlords receiving an aggregate rental from all such tenancies not exceeding £300 per
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1310">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>307</span>
annum. In fact, he secures an exemption not from the delay but from the conversion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see the point which the Minister of State is trying to make. But he still has not explained why it is impossible to make such a distinction, and I believe that he must return to this point on Report if he cannot deal with it now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister of State raised a number of points during his speech, and there are one or two points to which I take exception. One of the first arguments which he used was that as this system had been unfair in the past, there was no need to worry about continuing the system of unfairness for a little bit longer. That is paraphrasing what he said—that he saw no particular hardship which he had not seen in the past. That comes from a Party who are supposed to stand for equality. I thought that it came slightly strangely from the Minister's lips.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there has been any unfairness in the past, the Minister of State should be the first to leap into the breach in order to make sure that that inequality or unfairness is put right. For him to argue that because this situation has held in the past we should not worry too much about it now is very unsatisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not at all satisfied with the Minister's aguments. Let us start from the one position which is common ground to all members of the Committee—the acceptance of the principle that there is need to increase the rent on these houses which are already improved or which are about to be improved. It is an invidious distinction, as my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) said, to make between those who have already improved their property, who have made certain that it is up to a good standard and who, with their tenants, are enjoying the good standard of that property, and those who have still to improve their property and who will, we hope, improve their property under this Bill. The latter will be improving it, as my hon. and learned Friend points out, with an increased Government grant. These people who have already improved their properties
	<span class='label label-info column'>308</span>
have done so at their own expense, in some cases, or at a much lower level of assistance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember that earlier the Minister of State talked about the foolish virgins—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And the wise ones.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: —and the wise ones as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must say it is the wise virgins who are being penalised in this Clause. The landlords who have been prudent and who have kept their property up to a good standard are being treated unfairly in relation to those who have not kept up their property to the right standard. To that extent the Minister is making an invidious distinction against these people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister gave as one of the reasons for doing it the fact that this added incentive was needed to those who have not improved their property; in other words, they come first in the queue, so to speak, for the qualification certificate. It is a sad commentary on the other provisions in the Bill to encourage the landlord that the Government have to hold out this added carrot as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I, for one, would have hoped that the improved grants would be adequate. The Minister adds weight to the argument which we advanced earlier for increasing the level of grant from 50 per cent. to 75 per cent. This is judgment on the Minister's earlier arguments, if he thinks that the level of grant will not be adequate to carry out the improvements which we all want to see. In relation to what the Minister said earlier and also in relation to the practical provisions of the Bill, I feel that the latest argument of the Minister is thoroughly weak.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I move to the entirely practical argument which the Minister adduced in relation to the number of rent officers. I cannot accept his argument. He implied that the moment this Bill becomes law, we shall have landlords rushing to improve property, as indeed we hope they will. But even if they rush to improve it, as I see it there will be a gap of months, indeed perhaps a year or more, between the passage of the Bill and the time that these landlords apply for qualification certificates. I do not see applications for qualification certificates for houses which have still to be improved arising immediately the Bill
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1311">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>309</span>
becomes law. There is liable to be a gap of months in practical, administrative terms. The applications for improvement grants have to be put to the local authority. The applications for improvement grants have to be processed by the local authority. That takes time. The sanitary inspector has to go out from the local authority and examine these properties. The proposals have to go before the appropriate committee of the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Inevitably, even if every landlord in Scotland who had property to improve rushed, as a result of the provisions of this Bill, to apply for improvement grants, purely for administrative reasons there would be a gap between the passage of the Bill and the time when landlords of improved property applied for qualification certificates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is where I support the argument of my hon. and learned Friend. There will be this gap. We are not trying to put one person before another; we are not trying to make distinctions of fairness or unfairness between one class of landlord and another class of landlord. But we can spread the workload of these rent officers if we can get them first to consider the applications for qualification certificates from landlords whose property is already improved.

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is one of the most important Clauses in the Bill, Mr. Robertson, and I am very glad that you are allowing a short debate on the Question "That the Clause stand part of the Bill". The point that I want to raise is rather different from the one on which we have just divided. The point I want to raise is really another extension of the question which I asked</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>310</span>
	<p>equity, we believe that those landlords who have already improved their property should have the chance to come to the front of the queue in the application for qualification certificates. Certainly as properties are improved, landlords of those properties, having improved them, will come alongside those who have improved them in the past, and they will be considered together. That will happen.</p>
	<p>We are in no way asking that the increase in rent should apply by a specific date—some earlier date than that already specified in the Bill. Our request is made on two simple grounds—first, in terms of equity to avoid this invidious and entirely unnecessary and unjustified distinction between different classes of landlord, and secondly, in a more practical fashion, to spread the workload of the rent officers. Those are the grounds on which we have moved this Amendment, and I know that we are right to divide the Committee on it.</p>

	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 5, Noes 10.</p>
	<p>several times in the Bill, as to whether or not the Bill is going to work. The purpose of the Bill is to give legislative effect to the White Paper on older houses in Scotland, and it is called "A Plan for Action". The Minister nods his head. All I want to be sure of is that the Bill will, in fact, produce action. That is why it seems to me that this Clause is so important, because it deals with the conversion of existing controlled tenancies to regulated tenancies under the so-called fair rent procedure.</p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1312">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>311</span>
	<p>The Minister has very great faith in the efficiency of this procedure. As I understand it, the argument is that the landlord improves his house, goes to the rent officer, gets the rent fixed, and then lets the house. What I want to know is whether the new rent which he gets as a result of going to the rent officer will be sufficient to stimulate the necessary expenditure. Will it be sufficient, particularly in regard to a matter like housing, which has been at the centre of politics for the last 50 years? I doubt very much whether it will be sufficient, though I may be wrong.</p>
	<p>What I want to know from the Minister, if he can tell us, is what sort of return he thinks there will be on the outlay that a landlord must make in order to bring his property up to the proper condition.</p>
	<p>I have had some figures provided by the Chartered Land Agents' Society (Scotland) which cast doubt on this—I expect the Minister has seen them—and suggest that the return will be as low as 4 per cent. If he has not seen them I will just read a little—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have seen them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is in the introduction, so that the Minister can follow me. I will not read the whole thing. About half way down it says that if the cost of improving a house is £1,400, the grant will £700. This will probably be effected by bringing two houses together, the old rent of which would be £70, and the new rent these people, with all their experience, think is likely to be only £100. On an expenditure of £700 one gets a return of £30 which, according to this Society, is about 4 per cent. per annum. If it is as low as 4 per cent. per annum, can the Minister really see people investing money on such time-consuming and worrying matters as improving houses when they can get 8 per cent. by sitting on their backsides in front of the fire and doing nothing?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I should like the Minister to tell us is whether his calculations differ from those of the Chartered Land Agents' Society (Scotland), and whether he expects the return to be more than 4 per cent. If the return is going to be only about 4 per cent., does this not mean that
	<span class='label label-info column'>312</span>
little improvement will take place? If this is so, does it not mean that the Minister should reconsider the question of grant, which we discussed at an earlier stage today, or, alternatively, take a look at the whole of the fair rent procedure? The fair rent procedure may be fair in a way, but it seems not to produce a sufficient incentive to get people to improve their houses. In the past, Governments have so often willed the ends but not the means. This is a question of means. So I want the Minister to tell us what return the rent officer will allow on an improvement, and whether he considers that this will be sufficient to stimulate landlords to what he, and I, want to see done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Maban</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is difficult to anticipate the effect of the Bill on various sections of society. One can only do one's best. I think this is a better Bill than has ever been put before Parliament, not only in terms of the quantity of money made available, but also in terms of the favourable provisions that there are in it. It is difficult to make an assessment of what will happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would not necessarily accept the figures in the first part as being figures which would turn out to be true—that is to say, the £100. Even if they were true, I think the hon. Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith) would agree that rent regulation is not fixed. It is rent regulation for three years, when, at that time, it can be reviewed and fixed, one would assume, at a higher figure if the property were kept in its proper standard of repair and, for that matter, if it were improved in any way whatsoever. It would tend to rise. That being the case, I should think there would be a fair return to the landlord. After all, the system has only just started.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can understand landlords being concerned as to what will happen in the next registration period. We have had no evidence that tenants are upset by this, because those living in registered houses realise that the owner cannot evict them, as was the case under the previous Act, the Rent Act, 1957, and they know also that when their rent comes up for review they will have a say in the matter. If they disagree, like the landlord, they will have the right to go to the rent assessment committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1313">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>313</span>
I think we ought to give this a fair trial. I agree that most of the improvement grants under this Bill, will go to owner-occupiers. A landlord who makes this improvement, and finds he is not getting a reasonable return, can sell the house. As the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Bruce-Gardyne) made clear, he will have a better chance of selling the house after improvement than he would if his house were unimproved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not this precisely the danger, that if the landlord does not feel he is going to get a reasonable return, he will never start off and never get into the position in which he can sell the property? The Minister is always assuming that the work is going to begin. I am petrified that the work will not begin because the return is not enough. If the Minister can say that he has had no representations, and that what I told him today is the first that he has heard of it, that would encourage me slightly, and perhaps they have made a mistake. If there have been other representations on behalf of landlords, the Minister ought to think again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The only other representations I have had—as a matter of fact, I saw this as a private Member some time ago—were from the Federation of Property Owners. Some of the suggestions they have made are very good; they start off making this the principle point. I am not of the view that they are necessarily right in this. If I am wrong, we shall see how it comes out, and we shall have to make corrections. Each Government has made corrections as the years have gone on; we shall have to see how this turns out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we are doing is generous and flexible. We are on the way to making an improvement here. If the improvements do not go as well as we would like, we can review the position and see how it goes. If it goes very well, we can regard this as a very fundamental Bill. I cannot at this stage change fundamental principles into Bills. I agree this is a crucial and very important Clause, but, on the basis of information available to me, I see no reason why landlords cannot take this as a good Bill and seek to operate it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>314</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I take up the Minister on one point? When the next Government is formed, if it is found necessary to do what he has suggested and make adjustment upward, then I take it that from what he has said he is committed to supporting that course? I should be very satisfied if he could give that undertaking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would depend entirely on the circumstances. I am a very reasonable and rational man—like the hon. Gentleman. I am perfectly willing to look at the facts and figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where I think it is a bit unreasonable is to expect the public purse to improve assets which should have been improved over the years. We all agreed this afternoon that we are in a new climate of political opinion where we have a referee in this argument, namely the Rent Assessment Committees and the rent officers. I would like us to see something done by reason, rather than by prejudice and indignation, on both sides, both for those landlords who have not been able to improve their properties and for those tenants who, no matter what is done for the landlords, never live in improved or repaired property. These natural indignations must calm down in the light of the Rent Act, 1965. We must see whether we can make a better job of the existing housing stock we have in Scotland, without reducing in any way the amount of new houses we build in Scotland, but rather keeping that as a rising total over the years ahead.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are one or two observations that I would like to make on Clause 46. I am concerned about the provisions of subsection (1)(	<i>a</i>), where one of the criteria laid down before an application is to be entertained is that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the dwelling has at all times since the commencement of this Act been provided with all the standard amenities;"</p></blockquote>
I appreciate that no Amendments have been put down here. It would have been very difficult to frame Amendments, but nevertheless this is a point on which we would like an explanation. Is the Minister not going too far when he lays down a provision that since the commencement of the Act the standard amenities have at all times been there? At all times until when? Until the application is to be entertained under Clause 46(1)? Or does it mean that all standard amenities must have been there at all times either until the application has been entertained or until the application is considered under Clause 47(1)? If we read on, we find that the application then has to be considered. Does it mean at all times until the issue of a certificate of provisional approval, specified in Clause 47(2)?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know the 	<i>terminus a quo</i> here, and that it must be at all times since the Act came into effect. What is not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1315">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>317</span>
clear is the definition of the other end of the period. What happens, for example, if during that period—through an accident, let us say—one of the standard amenities—a wash-hand basin, for example—has been damaged and has to be repaired, and there is an interval of a week or so before that is done? I wish I could have the Minister's attention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am attending, I assure the hon. and learned Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the Minister is capable of doing several things at once. However, this is a point about which I am really concerned. As we are taking a period of time here with no qualification, what happens if there is accidental damage to a fitting and there is a time gap within which it has to be repaired? It could not technically be said that "at all times" during that period the standard amenities have been provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What concerns me even more is that there is provision for an appeal to the sheriff. In Clause 50(3) it is provided that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"On any appeal under this section the sheriff shall have regard to the state of the dwelling at the time of the hearing as well as at the time of the issue or refusal of the certificate …"</p></blockquote>
At the hearing, presumably, evidence on all this must be heard. I can understand readily that the current state of affairs can be established, but how does one prove to the satisfaction of the court or, for that matter, to the satisfaction of the authority under Clause 46, what the situation was a month ago or three months ago or even a year ago. I am intrigued at the necessity for the provisions of subsection (1)(	<i>a</i>). It seems to be unnecessarily wide. It seems to me to be difficult to comply with it. When I consider the appeal provisions under Clause 50, I do not know what kind of evidence will be expected and the difficulties which will be involved in trying to prove a state of affairs which no longer exists. Supposing, for example, the standard amenities did not exist at the outset of this period but did exist at the time of the application. Under subsection (1)(	<i>a</i>), the application cannot be entertained because the requirement is that during the whole
	<span class='label label-info column'>318</span>
period the standard amenities must be there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely that is an unnecessarily rigid test. Would it not be better to apply the test of what is the condition of the property at the time of the application. If it satisfied the standard amenities on that basis, the application could be considered. Why introduce complications of this nature which will lead to endless trouble, especially in the sheriff courts?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take, first the point of damage. If, for example, the hot water system broke down or somebody damaged the sink, or a w.c. was damaged, technically the amenity is still there. I agree with the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) that it would have to be argued before the sheriff whether it meant that the amenity had been removed, although I cannot see how, when an amenity breaks down, it can be said that the amenity is not there. However, if the hon. and learned Gentleman feels that he is right in his interpretation, I had better look at this provision to see whether we have expressed it properly. The fact that he has not drafted an Amendment, I take it, means that he would like us to do that, because he is not quite certain himself which wording ought to replace it. It is all very well to criticise it. I accept that. But we cannot leave it as a general criticism. I shall have to see whether an Amendment is necessary. But at the moment the advice given to me is that this is the proper way to express it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suppose that, in some perverse and eccentric way, someone could go into the house and take away the bath. The landlord could take away the bath for three months, for no other reason than that he wants the use of the bath elsewhere. That strikes as being an extremely remarkable situation. I suppose it could then be argued that the tenant did not have the use of the bath during that time, in which case it would be very unfair to the tenant. I will look at this, and, if I think it necessary, on Report, I shall do something about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have not put down an Amendment, and I do not like catching the Minister unawares or without proper notice. But I should have thought that the simplest thing to do was to apply the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1316">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>319</span>
test of what is the condition of the property at the time of the application. If it satisfies that standard, then the application can be entertained. I foresee enormous difficulties if we are to take a period of time. I should be grateful if the Minister would consider that. Would he let me know between now and Report what he thinks might be done about it, because I should like to discuss it with him, if that is possible?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>320</span>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second Amendment No. 112 splits Clause 47, and the other three Amendments make necessary adjustments to the text in the split Clause. The side notes we will also alter; references elsewhere to Clause 47 will be changed where appropriate, as a matter of printing. I am obliged to you, Mr. Robertson, and the House authorities for helping us here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The only question I wish to raise is the issue raised in Amendment No. 115, but I think it is relevant in considering Amendment No. 112. The new Clause would then begin:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where an application for a qualification certificate is made under section 46(1) of this Act the local authority shall, before considering it, serve on the person named in the application as the tenant."</p></blockquote>
What worries us here is that there is no time limit imposed. Later Amendments—Nos. 156 and so forth—if accepted, would meet the problem because there would be a time limit by which the final decision had to be taken, but as it stands at the moment there is no provision as to when the local authority must act. All they are told here is that before they consider the application they must serve a copy of the application on the person named in it. What we would like, to be sure, is that there will be some expedition and that the local authorities will not sit on these applications. As the Clause stands, even as it would be amended under this group of Amendments, there is nothing to prevent a local authority sitting on an application. What they must do before they start to consider the application is tell the tenant, named in the application, about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

the local authority would do that anyway. But, of course, if there is no statutory obligation on them to do so, one cannot be sure that they will. One does not want to leave a provision of this nature in the air whereby an application can be sat on by the local authority without taking action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister will accept our later Amendments, the problem does not arise because that imposes a period of 60 days within which the local authority must examine the situation and issue a certificate, or refuse a certificate. In that context, the earlier time limit would not be necessary because that time factor would oblige the local authority to act promptly. But if these later Amendments are not to be accepted, I suggest that we ought to put in some time factor within which the local authority serve a copy of this application.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The group of Amendments, Nos. 156, 157 and 158, and the group of Amendments Nos. 160, 161, 162 and 163, seek to impose a duty on the local authority to deal with these applications expeditiously. They also seek to eliminate the need for a separate Clause, Clause 49, but perhaps I may deal simply with the time limit first.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What Amendments Nos. 156 to 158 would achieve would be this. Clause 47(2) at the moment provides that, where an application has been made and after considering the representations made,
	<br><blockquote><p>"… they shall issue to the applicant a qualification certificate …".</p></blockquote>
There is no time limit there. It can be done at any time. What we seek to do there is to insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"they shall within sixty days of the receipt of the application"</p></blockquote>
do one or other of two things. Either
	<br><blockquote><p>"they shall issue to the applicant a qualification certificate, but if they are not so satisfied … give notice to the applicant of their refusal of his application"</p></blockquote>
and their reasons therefor. They shall send a copy of the certificates, or the notice to the tenant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we want to do here—and similar provisions arise in the later group of Amendments—is to five some kind of time limit within which the local authority must act. As I said earlier, Amendment No. 155, which requires a local authority to intimate this application to the person named in the application as the tenant within seven days, would not really be necessary were these later Amendments
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1318">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>323</span>
accepted because to do this within a defined time limit would, presumably, require the local authority to act expeditiously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We appreciate that there may be pressures here. There may be pressures on the local authority according to the way in which this legislation is going to operate, particularly at the beginning. What we do not like is just leaving this entirely to the discretion of the local authority—as far as I can see, at least—as to when they are going to act. What we would like to see is, when an application comes in and there is an obligation to pass it on to the tenant, that this is done within a short period of time—seven days, for example. They should go ahead and consider the application—we are necessarily thirled to the idea of 60 days—within a stipulated period within which the local authority must reach a determination of this application. Otherwise it could be—although one would hope not—that local authorities would just sit on these applications and do nothing about them. It is for these reasons that this group of Amendments has been moved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the purpose of these Amendments, and I may say that we have discussed this in considerable depth with the working party of local authority officials. The Committee will recognise that there will be two phases: there will be the ordinary flow of applications at a date after the Bill has become law and everything has settled down; and there will, of course, be the initial rush of applications—and some authorities are anticipating this—when the Bill becomes law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is very difficult to strike a balance about what the limits should be. A period which was too short could lead to over-hasty decisions, which would tend to be decisions to refuse in most authorities' cases where they were not certain of what they were doing. That would lead to appeals, and these, in turn, would increase work for everybody concerned. The setting of too long a period might have the disadvantage, particularly in the case of the ordinary flow of applications, of becoming the norm instead of the maximum. We do not wish to lengthen this period unnecessarily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>324</span>
I submit that the period over which it would be reasonable for local authorities to deal with cases in the initial rush of applications is bound to be a little longer than for the ordinary flow. In any event, it would be convenient for all concerned to have some flexibility in the timing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us take the example of a local authority which found that the qualifying conditions were met except for one tiny defect, which could be put right by a minor repair or replacement. The sensible thing for the authority to do in such circumstances would be to give the landlord time to carry out the repair and then to issue the certificate. If we had a fixed time limit, the authority would have no alternative but to refuse the application and so all the parties—the landlord, the tenant, the local authority—would have to go through the whole procedure again, with application, notice to the tenant, consideration of representations and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the possibility of a defect in the Bill as drafted, is that the local authorities may sit on applications. All I can say to hon. Members is that it is our duty, as councillors and Members of Parliament and Ministers, not to allow any local authority to develop bad habits. We can do that by exhortation, but I do not think it wise to do it by Statute, because I think we end up losing more than we gain. As I say, when we discussed this with the working party of local authority officials, all of whom, like us, are enthusiastic that the Bill should be a success, we felt that, on balance, it was better not to have fixed periods because of the disadvantages and to take the risk—a legitimate risk—that if there were serious delays we could, by other means, encourage local authorities not to delay. I ask the hon. and learned Gentleman not to press these Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not particularly anxious to press these Amendments because I appreciate that there are difficulties. It is difficult, as the Minister said, to strike the right time factor within which the operation should be completed. But if the Committee cannot accept a time limit within which the operation will be completed, namely within which the qualification certificate
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1319">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>325</span>
will be granted, it is all the more important that it should be made clear in the Statute that, from the moment this process starts, namely with the service of an application, the local authority must act properly. I ask the Minister to consider whether it would not be wiser, in his Amendment No. 112, to say something like this: "Where an application for a qualification certificate is made under section 46(1) of this Act the local authority shall forthwith serve on the person named in the application as the tenant and will immediately"—or words to that effect—"proceed to consider the application." That would meet our concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We appreciate the difficulty of putting down a date within which the whole thing should be completed as that would be difficult to estimate at this stage. However, we should like to see a provision in the Bill which, by Statute, drew to the local authority's attention that this is a process on which they must proceed actively. If the statutory duty were there, it would be a much more effective way of getting things moving than would the exhortations to which the Minister referred. If the Minister assured us that he would consider that proposal, I would gladly withdraw the Amendment, because I have always appreciated the force of the arguments against it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to make it clear that we are not being critical of local authorities. But we know how local authorities act, for example in planning matters. Delays occur, no doubt under pressure of work. I should not like to think that the Bill left the Committee without it being made clear that we expect local authorities to act forthwith on these matters. There is no reason why they should not act forthwith, for example, when it comes to serving an application upon the person named in the application as the tenant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This is purely a drafting Amendment.

I believe that the principle has already been accepted that reasons for refusal should be given without being requested.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would also be appropriate if we took Amendment No. 170, to the Long Title, in line 14, after 'areas', insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'to provide that the replacement by a tenant of fixtures and fittings is to be disregarded in determining a fair rent under a regulated tenancy;'.</p></blockquote>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2) was designed to ensure that in determining what a fair rent would be following the improvement with grant of house already subject to a regulated tenancy, the rent officer should have regard to any associated repair works proposed by the landlord. On further consideration we are now satisfied that the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1322">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>331</span>
subsection as it stands is unnecessary. Under Schedule 4 of the 1965 Rent Act the certificate of fair rent must specify the amount that would be a fair rent after completion of the improvements. Thus, what the rent officer has to consider is the state of the house, including its state of repair—Section 27 of the 1965 Act—at the time when the improvements will have been effected. At that time any repairs proposed will also have been completed and must therefore be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am obliged to you, Mr. Robertson, for allowing us to discuss the Government's new Clause 2. Although it is not connected directly with this Amendment as such, it does make an allied change in the provisions governing improvements and associated matters. New Clause 2 deals with replacements carried out by the tenant. It is the result of a case in the court of session which arose over the wording of Section 27(3) which still left a wide area in which a tenant could have his rent increased as a result of work he himself had carried out. The case was Stewart's Judicial Factor v. Gallagher, 1967 S.L.T. p. 52.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had a number of representations from persons concerned about this, and they have asked that the Government should add this new Clause. I think it quite fair that we should do so. It is manifestly unfair, in my opinion and the opinion of many other people, that if a tenant does work that adds to the comfort and convenience of his house, and pays for this work himself, he should, in effect, have to pay for it all over again by having his rent increased.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What this new Clause does is to extend Section 27(3) by requiring the rent officer to disregard, not only improvements carried out by the tenant but also replacement of any fixture or fitting carried out by the tenant. As in the case of improvements, this disregard would operate only where the tenant has carried out work which he was not obliged to do under the terms of his tenancy. The disregard operates in favour of the sitting tenant
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"or any predecessor in title of his".</p></blockquote>
This includes any previous tenant holding under the same lease as the sitting tenant, but not a previous tenant under a

It operates in favour of the following successions of the original tenant, that is to say his assignees, his heirs and the first or second successors remaining in occupation under Section 12(1)(	<i>g</i>) of the 1920 Rent Act or, alternatively, Section 13 of the 1965 Rent Act.

to say that this is another effort by the Government to fulfil the recommendations of the Cullingworth Report. When I look at paragraph 124 of that Report I find this a rather unsatisfactory description—"Areas of Unsatisfactory Environment". When an attempt is made to define it, we should have some clarification from the Minister on this point, because it seems to suggest that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"An Area of Unsatisfactory Environment is an area in which the majority of the houses fail below the standard for a Satisfactory House, or where the arrangement of the streets is unsatisfactory, or whore there are unsatisfactory environmental conditions such as those of noise, smell, dust, dirt, smoke, inadequate open space (including play space for children) or inadequate provision for the garaging and parking of cars."</p></blockquote>
There is something a little contradictory about that because, in the first place, it leaves the impression that these are the true slum conditions which are indicated in some of the attractive but doubtful pictures in the Cullingworth Report. But it is not always associated with the garaging or parking of cars.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As reported in column 13 of the Second Reading debate, the Secretary of State made special reference to this provision. It is a desirable provision, but, naturally, he went on to qualify it by saying,
	<br><blockquote><p>"In present economic circumstances progress is bound to be slower than many would like".—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Scottish Grand Committee,</i> 18th March, 1969; c. 13.]</p></blockquote>
While accepting the principle of this environmental grant—that is how it would be described—all of us have accepted that we might not be proceeding with any great haste. But I am assuming that it is not in the Bill just to dress up the Bill and that there is a serious intention to encourage some local authorities to use it. In that event, will the Minister indicate, where does the owner fit into this? I take it that he is not involved—or the occupier, whether it be the landlord or the owner-occupier. They are not involved in this at all. It is purely a matter for the local authority to decide in which areas they will carry out this improvement. I assume that I am right in saying that local authority houses are not covered by this at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are they? I take it that there have been consultations with the
	<span class='label label-info column'>334</span>
assessors, for example. I assume that under the normal rules of assessment, any improvement in the environment would increase the rateable value of the property, because that is one of the items which is included in assessing the value of property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another question is: why loans in this instance? If we are assuming that there is not to be a great deal of expenditure in this—and I confess that I should like to think that we were spending some money on it—is there any reason why it cannot be done out of revenue? Why the cumbersome procedure, presumably, of borrowing and repaying over 20 years? Surely that must make it much more expensive. Is there any reason why this formula has been introduced? I appreciate that, since this is a permissive part of the Bill, it will require sanction and approval by the Secretary of State, who takes into account the overall expenditure by local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I also ask what is included in environment. I want to talk about my stairs and closes again, because I feel that they are a most important part of environment. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Hannan) about the need to have modern middens—if that is an apt way of describing it. They are relevant, as are parking spaces, provided that we are talking in terms of reasonably good property. That is why I made the point earlier that Cullingsworth seems to envisage this as just the minimum requirement to tidy up the rubbish which lies about some of the very bad houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, we have had no indication from either the Secretary of State or the Minister about the class of property at which we are aiming in introducing this provision. I should like to think that it would be used in areas. But we have to be realists about it. I would tend to favour the use of it in reasonably good property, property which had a fair expectation of life, in a reasonably good district, where a little expenditure could provide some of the facilities which are badly needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, the number of parked cars on the main roads is a disgrace. In Glasgow the authorities are very tolerant about it—one does not have to have lights on a parked car at night, for instance, but there are many practical
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1324">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>335</span>
problems that local authorities have never faced. Certainly private owners, whether landlords or owner-occupiers, have never faced these problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth spending a few minutes on the Clause to find out just who it is that the Minister is to encourage to use this grant, to what extent the Government expect to be spending money and so on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am particularly interested in the recreational aspect of housing schemes. When the Minister is clearing up the questions asked by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Hugh D. Brown) about Clauses 58 and 59, will he say where the line will be drawn between these provisions and the valuable grants provided by the Scottish Education Department for community centres, sports pavilions and improvements in environmental facilities? I ask for clarification; I am not being critical.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to hon. Members for asking these questions, because this is undoubtedly a key Clause. I do not pretend that we will be able to use it to its fullest extent all at once. We are also discussing Clause 58, because Clauses 58 and 59 stand together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under Clause 58, a local authority will have power to assist by grants or loans anyone willing to carry out work on his own land. If the local authority incurs expense, it receives Exchequer assistance under Clause 59(1,	<i>b</i>) which says;
	<br><blockquote><p>"in making contributions to any other authority or person towards expenses which might be so incurred by the local authority",</p></blockquote>
The idea is that we will look at the environmental needs of any residential area, whether it be local authority schemes, or private housing mixed with public sector housing, or a completely private housing sector. Although the Cullingworth Report is the first report of the reconstituted Scottish Housing Advisory Committee, we have had several other valuable reports since then which are causing us concern and may give rise to legislation later. We are waiting to see what the sub-committee of the Scottish Housing Advisory Committee chaired by Sir James Miller will tell us about the amenity problems of local authority schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>336</span>
I am not promising that we can do everything at once, but this is a widely drawn Clause. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State very properly warned the Committee that in present economic circumstances we could not expect to develop the Clause to its fullest extent right away, but subsection (4) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The aggregate of any expenditure approved for the purposes of the section (whether on one or more applications) shall not exceed the sum arrived at by taking £100 for each of the dwellings in the area".</p></blockquote>
9.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We think that is adequate, but if we are wrong and in time this sum is found not to be adequate, by subsection (5), using the negative procedure, which hon. Members know to be more amenable to Ministers because it is less cumbersome and less difficult to find time for, we can alter that with the consent of the Treasury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So the intention of the Clause is long term. It is in no sense a temporary Clause. I hope that it will be a Clause that will be properly employed by the present Government and succeeding Governments to form a basis for work that we shall have arising from the report of the Committee that is measuring this at the present time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I was in Glasgow last Friday, I had occasion to complain to the Corporation, in a constructive way, that the days of rushed housing schemes are over. We now want value for money out of housing proposals. Because the basic subsidy provisions, which peg interest rates at 4 per cent., cover site preparation and layout, we expect the new procedures, instituted by us in 1968, to mean that submissions on new housing from Glasgow and other places must take more account of public open and recreational space. Account must be taken of cars, community facilities for tenants of large, multi-storey dwellings and children's activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other words, we have not overdone this. On the contrary. The reason why parts of our environment are not of the standard that we might expect—my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Hugh D. Brown) is right to speak up for Provan—is that we have not consciously provided for it in the past. This
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1325">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>337</span>
is an attempt to bring these high standards to areas not previously favoured. In future, we hope that all new construction will take this into account. Meanwhile, these provisions seek to bring a higher standard of environment to such areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not mean that in the sense in which these terrible pictures appear in the Cullingworth Report, but in cases where even marginal improvements could make so much difference. And if—if I may employ the argument of the hon. Gentleman in another context—in the process of doing so we improve the environment, that enhances the value of the house and, in turn, enriches the community, as well as the individual landlord. He can hardly complain therefore, if his valuation rises and the owner-occupier in that case feels that he is obliged to pay a little more in rates. He will be paying off part of the moneys incurred by the local authorities while living in far happier circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry to have taken so long to reply, but this is a very worthwhile point to emphasise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister in his reply raised some important matters. For my part, from this side of the Committee, I welcome the hon. Gentleman's remarks concerning the Government's intentions to do more, when they can, in the way of recreational facilities, environment, layout of new housing schemes and, indeed, improvement works carried out under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will remember that during discussion of the Town and Country Planing (Scotland) Bill, I raised this point in that context. I was delighted to hear the Minister this evening admit that there were schemes and housing areas planned in former years in which these facilities were not provided. That underlines the very point which I made during that Committee stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only disappointing qualification in the circumstances was when the Secretary of State said on Second Reading that money to be spent on this Part of the Bill would not be generally available in the present economic circumstances. This is unfortunate. All we can hope is that those circumstances improve so that we can achieve the improvements which the Bill may bring into being. We on this side of the Committee support that.

Frankly, we have had second thoughts about this matter.

The circumstances most likely to be specified would be the death of the borrower or the sale of the house.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the Clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of this new Clause is simple, as anyone who has read it will understand. I hasten to say immediately that by no manner of means do I claim that my wording is necessarily correct in terms of legislation, and I appreciate that, if the principle of this Clause is accepted, it might be necessary for it to be redrafted. Therefore, I intend to deal not with the specific wording but with the principle of the Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I am attempting to do in this new Clause is to introduce an appeal procedure in the event of a local authority refusing an application for a discretionary grant. In this case, we have drawn up an appeal to the Secretary of State, which we believe to be the best way in which the appeal procedure would work. I hasten to say that we do not believe that the appeal procedure should necessarily follow this method, as long as the principle of appeal is accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We on this side of the Committee do not claim any particular novelty in introducing this new Clause. We are introducing it on the strength of the Cullingworth Committee's Report. If hon. Members would like to refer to that Report, they will find that in paragraphs 182 to 185 the Committee argue the need for an appeal procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not intend to go into the background of the Cullingworth Committee's argument because it is all clearly laid
	<span class='label label-info column'>340</span>
out in those paragraphs, but it adds considerable strength to my argument that the Cullingworth Committee felt it necessary to make this recommendation. It is interesting to recall that in 1947 the McTaggart Committee came to the same conclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Briefly, I raise the two points which caused the Cullingworth Committee to come to this conclusion. First, they realised that, over Scotland, the whole process of discretionary improvement grant was not always being applied in the best way possible. Particularly in paragraph 184, they identify two points—political opposition on the part of some local authorities to improvement grants schemes and the half-hearted way in which others administer them. I will avoid falling into the trap into which the Minister of State fell in our discussion on Clause 1 when he tried to single out a specific local authority. I should be the last person to try to point a finger at those who are politically opposed to the discretionary improvement grants and at those who are half-hearted in their administration of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier, the Minister singled out particular local authorities. He qualified it at the time, but more clearly in a letter to the local authority concerned since, saying that he was not singling them out for any specific purpose. I accept his assurance in the spirit in which it was given. He must realise that it caused considerable concern to those local authorities at the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At that time he singled out two particular local authorities who—this was the implication, whether it was intended or not—were hanging back in their improvement of housing: part of the County of Angus and the whole of the County of Kincardine. I never like to single out those who do badly. I like to single out those who do well. I hope that the Minister has taken note of the figures on page 89 of the Cullingworth Report, in Table C. In the league of those local authorities who have done well in giving improvement grants, the County of Angus and the County of Kincardine come third and fourth of the counties of Scotland. That demonstrates that these two counties, Angus and Kincardine, have an extremely good record and are extremely concerned to see that in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1327">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>341</span>
matter of improvement of houses they are not lagging behind other local authority areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will refer again to this league, because I have tried to single out the particularly good authorities, in contrast to the Minister's approach. It is interesting to note that among large burghs and cities, the rates of improvement grant per thousand vary from 99 at the top of the league to nothing at the bottom. Among small burghs and counties, they vary from a rate of under 78 per thousand at the top to one at the bottom. This demonstrates very clearly the great variation over the whole of Scotland in the way in which discretionary improvement grants are applied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principle of the new Clause is fairly clear. It adopts the basis of the argument of the Cullingworth Committee. I have drawn one or two arguments out from their recommendations, and I do not intend to go into them in more detail. We want to keep a certain amount of consistency between different local authorities and the way in which they apply the provisions which we are enacting in the Bill. I am sure that there is a sense of unfairness between people who wish to improve property in local authority areas; there are authorities who have adopted a cooperative and helpful attitude towards applications for improvement grants and there are others who, for one reason or another, as the Cullingworth Committee analysed, have not co-operated and have not been so helpful towards this. We should try, in the interests of equity and fairness, to make sure that the provisions enacted in the Bill are applied fairly and evenly over Scotland. We want to see them applied generally. An appeal procedure could be of great help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that this operates against the argument which the Minister used earlier, when I made a plea for consistency among local authorities; it operates in his mind against the principle of discretion. I agree that that may be an obstacle. These grants are discretionary, and the moment an appeal procedure is introduced the whole element of discretion may be taken away. At the back of its mind the local authority at all times will know that there is an appeal from their decisions and that to some extent, I appreciate, removes the element
	<span class='label label-info column'>342</span>
of discretion. The Minister introduced that argument earlier and I accept that there is reason in it. There is reason in the argument that discretion should be left to the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But if we consider this great variation in improvement grants in different parts of Scotland—I have taken one or two extracts from the Cullingworth Committee's Report—we must agree that we do not want such variation if we are to carry forward the improvement of houses in Scotland as swiftly and as effectively as we believe to be necessary. Those of us who support the Bill want to see its aims achieved as quickly and as fairly as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will accept the principle of the new Clause. If he disagrees with the wording of the new Clause or with the precise method of an appeal procedure suggested, but is prepared between now and Report to consider whether some other form of appeal procedure would be better, I shall be satisfied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Small</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am tempted to resist this Clause while I accept much that was said by the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith). I cannot see standardisation arising out of appeals to the Secretary of State. That is always an individual appeal involving individual opinion. The method is inapplicable to all the authorities throughout Scotland. If a man won his case, it would be elevated to a Crichel Down situation. In fact, it is a minor matter of a minor work. I do not think that we can elevate that to an appeal to the Secretary of State on grounds of discretion, involving the local authority and its legal department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from the social element in the use of a rent officer and the assessment of fair rent, the appeal becomes a remit against the local authority 	<i>in toto</i>—not departmentally but 	<i>in toto.</i> We then require the whole of the local authority's legal department to defend its action in deciding a discretionary grant—by a discretion granted to it under the Bill. I fear the danger in the proposal of creating case law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>343</span>
REPORT in col. 29 from the hon. Member for Galloway (Mr. Brewis), I should have had to take time in thinking this over. What I did after the hon. Member's speech was to discuss the matter with my colleagues, and I wrote to the hon. Member on 14th April explaining why I did not think that this was a desirable change. Incidentally, our colleagues discussing the English Bill have also ventilated this matter thoroughly, and this suggestion was negatived in their proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) has not had the experience yet of having his comments divided into two at different parts of the proceedings and married together to make a different impression from what he intends. It is a very wicked thing to do, but people do it to one from time to time. The hon. Member should not allow that to put him off doing his duty. I thought he was devaluing his own argument by praising the authorities which had carried out discretionary grants so extensively. If the authorities have done well in promoting discretionary grants, why institute a right of appeal? If the argument were that discretionary grants were rarely given because of lazy local authorities or because local authorities were averse to giving money for this purpose, the new Clause would be very powerful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman, however, has made my case for me. He has recited from the Cullingworth Report the figures of discretionary grants. I am not, incidentally, very happy at the pace at which they are going, but I take the point made by the hon. Gentleman. We have 233 local authorities in Scotland which are housing authorities. When the hon. Member for Galloway was, quite rightly, pursuing me on this matter in a Question on 23rd April, I gave the Answer that cumulatively we had achieved 10 grants per 1,000 private houses in the districts of all but 24 of those 233 authorities. That is not bad; 10 per cent. of authorities failed the 10 per 1,000 measure. Of the 24, five gave no grants at all. I itemised those authorities, since I think it wrong that they should give no grants at all. I itemised them not to embarrass them, but in the hope that they might be encouraged to go ahead with discretionary grants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>344</span>
The worst offender was Ayr Burgh which, I was shocked to discover, as, no doubt, will be the hon. Gentleman if he is not already aware of this, actually told the Cullingworth Committee that it does not operate the improvement grant provisions. I have asked the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) to tick them off. I certainly would do so if I were to visit them—not in a hostile manner, but to persuade them, in a friendly way, that they are not being fair to the people of Ayr in failing to provide these grants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the other places involved was Whithorn, in the constituency of the hon. Member for Galloway. I know that he takes this to heart and that if he has not spoken to the authority already, he will certainly be doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am in favour of discretionary grants being pushed forward, but I put it to the Committee that it is quite wrong for us, having given the local authority power of discretion so that it can go into the matter of precise terms of cost, and the conditions under which the grant is being given, suddenly to inform it, "By the way, we are going to have an appeal mechanism "This would be so burdensome for the Secretary of State as to be almost intolerable. It would mean saying to the local authority, where we disagreed in the appeal case, "We do not like the way you have exercised discretion here". We have to do that on some occasions, but we would not like to be drawn into that arena.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman may say to me, "Let us have a system whereby there are known rules". We have such a system. We introduced a standard grant in 1959. Local authorities cannot in most circumstances refuse that standard grant. I consider, therefore, that we have covered all the possibilities of the situation, and I do not think it wise to introduce an appeals system. I do not criticise the hon. Gentleman's drafting. As far as I am aware, it is impeccable. I criticise drafting only where it defeats the object of the exercise or where it makes a nonsense of the Bill. Thus, I am quarrelling not with the drafting, but with the principle, which, I consider, is not a sound one. It is one that was certainly raised by Cullingworth—an excellent Report, of which we have implemented 99.9 per cent. On this item, however,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1329">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

no. On balance, it is our job to encourage local authorities to give more discretionary grants. But I do not think that the principle of appeals, where there is a dispute over discretionary grants, is wise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot say that I am particularly happy or satified with the Minister's answer. I do not imagine that he thought I would be. The moment he started to say that the drafting was impeccable, it was confirmed in my mind that the principle was entirely unacceptable to him. The hon. Gentleman would never have taken the trouble to praise the drafting unless he was certain that he intended to reject the new Clause out of hand. Knowing the way in which the Minister's mind works, I am sure that if the principle of the Clause had been acceptable, he would have found many holes in the drafting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Hugh D. Brown) would agree, in his usual charitable way, that I entertain no nasty thoughts in my mind on this point. I am afraid that the Minister of State rather misconstrued me when he said that I was quoting the local authorities with very good records in terms of improvement grants. I was not quoting them in support of my argument at all. I was just taking pleasure in quoting these very good examples from my own area, and saying how much on the spot my own local authorities are, in contrast to the impression—and I use the word "impression" advisedly—which the Minister of State gave in our debate on Clause 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was my purpose in singling it out, but I was much more concerned about those local authorities which the Minister of State mentioned and which come at the bottom of the list. It is those authorities that I had in mind when I introduced this new Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that the Cullingworth Committee equally put forward the view that the situation could be helped where the local authorities were required to have a survey of their houses that needed improvement. Of course, this is provided for under Clause 1 of this Bill, and to that extent Cullingworth has been put into effect so far as this question of improvement grants is concerned. However, I think we should strengthen this position
	<span class='label label-info column'>346</span>
further. Despite this question of discretionary grants, the very fact that we have a considerable number of local authorities with records very much behind the leaders in the field, I believe this position ought to be strengthened. For that reason I believe this new Clause ought to be supported.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 121 seems to rewrite paragraph 10(1) of the Schedule. I had a look at this point this afternoon, and I am just wondering whether this makes the slightest difference to what is contained in sub-paragraph (1). The effect of it seems to be simply that if the rent specified in the certificate is less than a fair rent, that is the rent which is being registered. But if it is more than what is regarded as a fair rent, then the rent officer himself determines a fair rent. To my mind that is the effect of the existing sub-paragraph. I wonder why that change has been made. I am puzzled to know what difference Amendment No. 121 makes to the existing provision in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is to clarify. We intend no difference. We simply intend to make it clear that the rent officer is precluded from registering a rent higher than that
	<span class='label label-info column'>348</span>
shown in the certificate of fair rent, and provided that if the tenant does not make representations and the differences in the works imply that a fair rent would be higher, the rent officer can register the rent specified on the certificate of fair-rent without calling a consultation of the parties. As he could not vary the rent upwards, the consultation would be pointless.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems to me that that is precisely what paragraph 10 did. It says:

However, the Minister said that it makes no difference and he feels that it is clearer, so I certainly should not like to oppose it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is another attempt to try to clarify this Part of the Bill. Paragraph 7 of the Schedule ensures that the phasing arrangements apply if the tenant or tenant or a statutory successor enters into a new contractual tenancy during the phasing period. Paragraph 8 of the Schedule ensures similarly that the phasing arrangments apply if the tenant or his statutory successor enters into a new contractual tenancy before the phasing period begins. The intention of the words proposed to be left out was that "directly" meant a first successor who gets a controlled tenancy and "indirectly" covers a second successor under Section 13 of the Rent Act 1965, who gets not a continuation of the controlled tenancy but a regulated tenancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The words were therefore included to make it clear that the phasing arrangements would apply to a second successor as well as to a first successor. But it has been drawn to our attention that these words could be confusing rather than clarifying, and we feel that maybe it would be better to take them out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>'any such amount and any amount to be so noted as an amount apportioned or to be apportioned to the services shall be included'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These Amendments are an attempt to clear up an ambiguity which has been pointed out to us in paragraph 12 which deals with payments for services provided by the landlord which are incorporated in the rent. The ambiguity drawn to our attention arises from the use of the word "amount". In the context of the Schedule that can mean either the amount of the total rent attributable to services, for example, in paragraph 5(1), or the amount of the increase of rent which is apportioned to the increase in the payment of services, for example in paragraph 5(2).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 125 makes it clear that in an application for the registration of rent or for a certificate of fair rent a landlord need specify only the proportion of the total rent which he regards as attributable to services. There is no need to concern himself with the proportion of increase of rent which is so attributable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 126 is consequential on Amendment No. 125. It makes it clear that both amounts can be the subject of representations by the tenant or appeals to the rent assessment committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This is an important Amendment which provides that when a rent registered by a rent officer is superseded on appeal by
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1332">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>351</span>
a rent determined by a rent assessment committee, the period over which the rent increase is phased will run from the date on which the rent officer's original decision was registered. The yearly rent increases will, of course, be calculated on the basis of the rent assessment committee's decision under paragraph 3 of the Schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reference to Section 7(	<i>b</i>) of the Rent Act, 1965, means that if the rent assessment committee increases the rent, the additional amount to which the landlord is entitled can be recovered only from a current date, although the phasing of the whole increase is still calculated from the date of the original registration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, on the other hand, the rent assessment committee reduces the rent, any excess rent paid since the rent officer's determination is recoverable by the tenant under the ordinary Rent Act provisions for the recovery of excess rent—Section 14 of the increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act, 1920, as applied by Schedule 1(6) to the Rent Act, 1965.

	<br><blockquote><p>(	<i>c</i>) in subsection (2)(	<i>b</i>) for the words 'three months' wherever they occur there shall be substituted the words 'six weeks'.</p></blockquote>
The effect of this Amendment is obviously to reduce from three months to six weeks the period allowed for the demolition of the building by its owner after it has been vacated in consequence of a demolition order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment is in response to representations which I received from some of my hon. Friends and from Glasgow Corporation asking that the period should be reduced to 28 days. The corporation argues that owners seldom do their own demolition and are prepared to wait for the corporation to act in default. I agree that a three-month period is substantial, and in practice it largely delays progress unnecessarily. In England the corresponding period is six weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the period has always been longer in Scotland, on the argument that tenement buildings are more difficult to demolish than English unfit houses and the owner needs a longer period to do demolition, it was thought by the Secretary of State and his colleagues in the light of Glasgow's representations that six weeks might be adopted as the period in Scotland. I hope the Committee agrees. We think 28 days is too short to give
	<span class='label label-info column'>354</span>
the owner of the tenement a fair opportunity to demolish it himself. On the other hand, we are prepared to reduce the period in this way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no doubt the Minister is right, but I am always suspicious when large corporations buttonhole Ministers for changes in Acts which Parliament saw fit to pass only a few years ago. Has the Minister received any representations from property owners or factors' associations about this matter? He mentioned only Glasgow Corporation and some of his hon. Friends. There may be difficulties for a private owner demolishing tenement property within the statutory period. Is this change called for?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think it is. It was in 1930 that we laid down three months.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not 1967?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had consolidating Acts since 1930. A good case was put to us by the corporation which is peculiarly affected, as we know, by these measures. The Bill will be very welcome to it. We certainly have not had contrary responses from the property owners. I do not blame them for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On balance, contrasting English practice and experience with a request made by Glasgow, where the authority instead of the owners are left to clear this, it seems reasonable to make this change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.0 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that in Glasgow, for instance where demolition is left to the corporation anyway, it is obviously sensible to shorten the period. But, like my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie), I am interested in the answers to two questions. The Minister said that he had had no representations from property owners. Has he discussed it with property owners? Organisations outside Parliament often read what is in a Bill but do not always have access to Amendments, and they may not know what the Minister is doing in this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, while this provision applies specifically to Glasgow, has there been the same type of experience in other areas? The problem of demolition is far greater in Glasgow, but demolition takes place elsewhere and in other areas more of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1334">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>355</span>
cost may fall on the property owner than, by default, on the local authority. In such districts, will the private owner have adequate time in six weeks?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be interesting to know when this representation was made by Glasgow Corporation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am concerned about this provision because it applies to the whole of Scotland. When a cottage or an old house is demolished will not be of vital importance. It is not necessarily in the best interests of the economy and productivity to pull down old houses which could wait another six weeks or six months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some areas one cannot simply lift up a telephone and say, "I want a house demolished". It is not as easy as all that. I hope that the Minister will realise that frequently the best way of getting a house demolished is to get the roads authority of the county council to demolish it for infill of stone and so on in road improvement schemes. It may not fit the plans of the county council to undertake a demolition within six weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this instance a little more discretion should be given to local authorities. A six months' period seems not unrealistic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am reluctant, Mr. Robertson, in view of your impartial capacity, to drag you into this, but I have been asked about other local authorities and Paisley is one which comes to my attention. You yourself know of the problems in Paisley, and I will leave it at that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other parts of Scotland where the same problems arise. I made the point that Glasgow Corporation has argued that many burghs seldom fulfil their demolition responsibilities. It is therefore a drawback to the corporation to have to thole this assize before it is able to take proper action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is perfectly right and fair that we should look at this in the light of Glasgow's experience and that of other authorities. I am asked when I received these representations. The answer is February, so I can hardly be accused of making a hasty decision. I agree that the property owners have not been consulted. Many property owners are good members of their federation and we have no com-
	<span class='label label-info column'>356</span>
plaint against them on this score, but their federation is not answerable for all owners. The owners who upset the larger authorities in Scotland are those who are either not traceable—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friends will agree that it would be unwise of me to withdraw an Amendment when I have given an indication that I think it reasonable to reduce the period of three months. If hon. Gentlemen opposite feel that reducing it to six weeks is too drastic and that I should reduce it to something less than three months, but more than six weeks, I am perfectly willing to think about that again. But I have a feeling that if I do that, I will evoke representations to go to 28 days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not acceding to Glasgow Corporation's request. I am not being buttonholed and obliged to put in 28 days. I have indicated that I am not prepared to agree to 28 days because it is too short in my view. Therefore, I have compromised at 42 days, six weeks. I suggest that we should leave it at that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make this Amendment. If hon. Gentlemen opposite press me to make it less than three months, but not as little as six weeks, I promise to look at it again and consult one or two people to discover the general consensus. Beyond that I cannot go.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We do not want to press the Minister to do anything here. We are in the position of having to accept his advice in these matters, and, on the whole, he cannot complain at the way in which we accept these latter Amendments, since this is the only way in which Parliament can work. The Minister represents the Government, and has expert advisers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I consider that it is unfortunate that a change to public general statutes, such as the Housing Acts, should come along by way of an Amendment. If this mattered all that much to the great Corporation of Glasgow, then, in the long negotiations leading up to the publication of this Bill, one would have expected them to have made this point. We do not blame the Minister for this. He only received it in February, after the publication of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1335">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>357</span>
Bill. This kind of change should be incorporated in the Bill. That it is not is through the fault of Glasgow Corporation, who only at the last minute made this suggestion—no doubt quite a good one, if only it had come along earlier so that it could have been included in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some of us have been very patient sitting here, even though we would like to have made some contributions at an earlier stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the spirit in which the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) made his contribution. Of course, Glasgow was represented on the working party, as were other local authorities. But in the large development areas in Glasgow instances continue to crop up of "men of straw"—people who cannot be got at. I remind the Committee that amendments were promulgated earlier by some Glasgow members, even after the publication of the Bill, which this Committee, in its wisdom, considered it would be wise to make—afterthoughts when the Bill had been printed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Committee to accept the Amendment as it stands. It will benefit other local authorities as well as Glasgow when they embark upon development schemes of their own which, while not coming up to the standards of Glasgow, will be of some dimension.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

As the Committee knows, we are making an adjustment to Section 137 of the 1966 Act in paragraph 18 of Schedule 6. This Amendment modifies the effect of that Amendment. Some adjustment of that Section is necessary in any event, and we are taking this opportunity to relate the duty to the provision of "housing accommodation" instead of "new houses", so that there is no doubt that the provision of improved houses would amount to compliance with the duty imposed by that Section.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This Amendment makes a very small adjustment in the modification made by paragraph 34 of Schedule 6, to the provisions of Section 26 of the 1968 Act relating to the Exchequer assistance to be given to the deficit of the S.S.H.A. The main point is that paragraph 34, as drafted, provides for inclusion in the deficit calculation of any income received by the S.S.H.A. in the form of Exchequer
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1336">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>359</span>
contributions in support of their expenditure on environmental improvement which we discussed earlier. It fails, however, to provide for inclusion in the calculation of the expenditure incurred by the S.S.H.A. on this work. The Amendment, therefore, ensures that both income and expenditure are properly brought into the calculation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is no longer a starred Amendment as such.

This Amendment repeals subsection (4) of Section 180 of the 1966 Act. As at present drafted, the repeal extends only to subsection (3). Subsection (4) requires that, in relation to clearance area procedure, the medical officer of health should consult the sanitary inspector before making an official representation. With the repeal of the clearance area provisions and the substitution of housing treatment area provisions, which do not rest on official representation, subsection (4) is, of course, no longer necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This Amendment would insert in Schedule 7 a repeal which we overlooked. This relates to a reference in Section 54(2) of the 1968 Act to Section 33(1) of that Act. Section 33(1) is being repealed. Accordingly, we feel that we ought to make this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

May I also thank my hon. Friends for their support during the Committee and in the earlier stages in consultation over the Bill. May I also thank the Cullingworth Committee and all those who served on the Scottish Housing Advisory Committee for the tremendous work which they did in giving birth to this Bill and, of course, I ought to thank my officials whom we in the Scottish Office all admire for the way in which they have been the accoucheurs of this Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
