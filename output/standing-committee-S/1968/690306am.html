	<div class='title'>DENTAL INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF PUPILS AND YOUNG PERSONS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Amendment moved</i> [	<i>4th March</i>], No. 55, in page 8, line 42, leave out "at appropriate intervals".—[	<i>Mr. MacArthur.</i>]</p>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we meet this afternoon at 4 o'clock we shall meet in Room 9. We were discussing Amendments 55 and 56 together, and Mr. MacArthur was speaking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think I had concluded my remarks on Amendment 55 when we adjourned on Tuesday, and I remind the hon. Gentleman that I then asked him for information about the staffing of the school dental service and about the shortfall, which I understand there is, between the numbers actually in the service and the numbers required to provide reasonable intervals of dental inspection for the children in our schools. I also asked the Minister to let us know what he regarded as appropriate intervals for the purposes of this Clause. I remind the Minister of that, because the Bill has now been running for quite a long time, and as it progresses, so the Minister seems to find it more difficult to answer the specific questions which are put. So I hope that today we will get answers to those questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now pass to Amendment 56. The Minister will appreciate that its object is not to distort the purposes of the Clause but rather to call attention to certain apparent inconsistencies which I should be glad if he would remove from the Bill. In order to understand Clause 10, it is necessary to read it in conjunction
	<span class='label label-info column'>480</span>
with Sections 58 and 59 of the Education (Scotland) Act, 1962. That is because Clause 10 is simply a draft for a new Section 58A which is to be inserted in the 1962 Act. Here, again, we have an example of the difficulty which will face people outside when this Bill is enacted, in trying to relate its terms to the requirements of the 1962 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, Section 58 of the parent Act provides for the medical inspection, supervision and treatment of pupils, and the tone of that Section is one of compulsion. The Minister will appreciate that I am not complaining about that, because it is clearly very important that there should be a duty on local authorities to provide facilities for medical inspection, supervision and treatment for the pupils in their care, but if one compares the medical provisions of Section 58 with the dental provisions of the new Section 58A, which is, in fact, Clause 10 of the present Bill, one finds certain inconsistencies. So far as medical inspection is concerned, there is a compulsion on local authorities in Section 58. So far as dental inspection is concerned, there is a compulsion on local authorities in the new Section 58A. So far as medical treatment is concerned, there is a compulsion on education authorities in Section 58(3) of the parent Act. But, as I understand it, there is not the same compulsion in the new Section 58A.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I am right in that understanding, I fail to comprehend why the same compulsory requirement should not apply to dental treatment as to medical treatment. All of us know the importance of medical treatment, but, equally, we are all acutely aware of the continuing and growing need for proper dental treatment for children. On previous occasions we have discussed the quite alarming incidence of dental decay among young people. We have had many debates, about the fluoridation question and so on, which have lent point to the extent of dental decay among children. Yet in this Bill, dealing with dental inspection and treatment of young people in schools, there is apparently no compulsion so far as the treatment of children is concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Bruce Millan)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So that we do not elaborate on this point, the position is, in fact, on all fours. This is covered
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0712">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>481</span>
by Section 59 of the 1962 Act. The position about dental treatment is exactly the same as for medical treatment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the hon. Gentleman. In fact, I referred to Section 59 earlier on. I hope I am wrong, but here, again, I am not sure from my reading of these Sections that the compulsion extends to the pupils themselves. May I put it that way round? The inspection is to be there, the supervision is to be there, but there is no compulsion in terms of taking the treatment which is recommended to the child.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But there is no compulsion on the medical side either. If the hon. Gentleman will look again at Section 58 of the 1962 Act, he will see that the provision about compulsion on the pupils' side relate only to medical inspection—not to medical treatment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I agree entirely with the Minister on that point. I shall require a minute or two to refresh my mind about the actual sense of the wording of the Sections. Perhaps he will explain that a little further. Anyway, the main point I am seeking to make, even if the consistency point is not a valid one, is that there is great concern about the state of the dental health of our children, and that there should be some element of compulsion in terms of the provision of the treatment required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment proposes the insertion of the words "and treatment if necessary" after the inspection requirement in Clause 10. I appreciate that treatment is covered in Section 59 of the parent Act, but we felt that this was a way of calling attention to the problem which exists, and to the very pressing need to provide the most effective treatment for our children who, regrettably, suffer so widely from dental decay and other troubles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Naturally, I agree with a great deal of what the hon. Gentleman has been saying about the shortage of dental treatment. I, too, would like to have seen in the Clause words such as he proposes, but I had thought of slightly different though not fundamentally different, wording. I had intended to put down an Amendment for
	<span class='label label-info column'>482</span>
probing, which is a highly appropriate word in this connection. I should have suggested:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It shall be the duty of an education authority to provide for the dental inspection, and treatment when necessary, at appropriate intervals"—</p></blockquote>
and then words to the effect of:
	<br><blockquote><p>"in the course of each school year."</p></blockquote>
The words "appropriate intervals" leave the Clause wide open. I do not think there is a definition of "appropriate intervals", and I do not know whether there could be. But I should like to have seen the words "intervals", in the plural, "in the course of each school year ".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position has become really desperate in certain areas, and on a recent visit to my constituency the Minister of State found that this was one of the priority questions of the district councils, such as the District Council of Harris. One can imagine what the situation is like for adults, as well as for children, in island areas, especially offshore island areas off the other islands where, if we cannot have a visiting dentist, we must make arrangements to go to a dentist on the major island territories. It means hiring boats or ferries and so on, and it adds up to quite a great deal of expense, with time away from work and so on. So much for adults.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For children the position is even more desperate in many cases. Children in some schools have not seen a dentist for years. This is not an exaggeration. I am not trying to dramatise; I am trying to draw attention to the position as forcefully as I can. That situation is going to get much worse in the islands in the near future, because there is going to be a very considerable extension of the guided missile range in South Uist. There are going to be some thousands of Service personnel coming in there, with hundreds of children being added to the school rolls in that area, and so there will be an aggravation of the situation. There has been the greatest difficulty over the last several years—I know the difficulty is shared by other places, but it always seems worse in outlying places, because of the time and distance factors—and I hope that when these extra children are added to the school rolls some special provision is going to be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0713">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>483</span>
That is all incidental to the general question raised by the hon. Gentleman today. I agree so much with his remarks that if I went over the ground again, I should be repeating what he said, but I assure the Minister that there is anxiety to have an assurance that there are going to be inspections and treatment when necessary, at least once within each school year. Therefore, I should certainly have proposed something like the words,
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"treatment when necessary, at appropriate intervals in the course of each school year".</p></blockquote>
To see a school year going by with no inspection and treatment at all is very alarming, and it causes people completely to lose confidence in the school dental service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all know how difficult it is to find dentists at all, owing to the general shortage. But the Minister will appreciate that some special incentives are necessary for outlying areas, such as the island areas, particularly for people who do not belong to those areas, who are not at home there and who have not grown up there, such as doctors, parsons and educational people. Our big problem is to provide inducements for dentists to go to these areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had experience of an arrangement, which is essentially only a temporary one and a very partial solution, where dentists in the city areas of Glasgow and Edinburgh help out by developing what they call branch or spur practices. They visit from Edinburgh or Glasgow—at least, one or two have been doing this over the years—for a matter of days or a week or two, and they try to cover all the ground they can. The other method, to which the Secretary of State in Jack Maclay's day had recourse, was to offer financial inducements, to offer a house and to offer everything in the way of facilities for a mobile clinic, the best of equipment and so on, which any good dentist would insist upon if he were going to stay for any length of time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had excellent dentists, but the problem is to get them to stay. The Minister and the Government will have to face this problem of making it reasonably worth while for dentists to go to the area, to stay in the area and make the practice itself as attractive, as easy for
	<span class='label label-info column'>484</span>
them to operate and as well equipped as is possible, having regard to the fact that there are not many fully-equipped clinics in the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an island like the Island of Scalpay off Harris it should be an absolute minimum to have a clinic attached to the school possibly instead of people having to come across in ferries or hiring boats at their own expense, if the doctor does not order it, covering quite long distances over a long period, away from their work and so on. These are the things we have to face, in the island areas particularly. This also applies to the peninsula areas, some of which are even worse off, when there is no sea transport to speak of, and there are bad roads, so that there is hardly any access at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It does not apply to the Western Isles alone, but we have an aggravated problem because it is difficult to attract professional people and dentists to the area, in particular at a time of shortage when they have a sellers' market throughout the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having regard to what is coming in the islands, and to other developments in other parts of the Highlands and Islands, having regard to what is happening in the Western Isles with the rocket range and the expansion of the school population, I hope the Minister has in mind making better provisions by one means or another—within that overall difficulty, which I well recognise, the overall shortage of dentists—or the special problems will become worse rather than better in the years to come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fluoridation is possibly part of the answer, but it is not all the answer by any means. Dental care, supervision and treatment are the important and continuing necessities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The official answer has been in so many cases, "Your real difficulty is when somebody has toothache". This is perfectly true. This is when the emergency becomes spotlighted. This is when the probing part becomes the drilling part, as the hon. Gentleman might say. It is the situation which lights up the shortage of dentists. But the emergency arises in the first place from the lack of dental inspections, the lack of supervision and lack of regular dental treatment. The emergency is only a byproduct of all these other things. I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0714">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>485</span>
would like those who give that official answer to have another look at that old-time and traditional answer, because it is not only the emergency we are concerned with, but preventing the emergency, and having somebody on the spot to deal with the emergency. It is not much good making long-term appointments for someone who has violent toothache. That is the time when one wants the dentist there. I agree that it is less urgent in certain adult cases when it is a question of fillings; one can wait a few days, but people should not have to wait, and dentists themselves do not like this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In these particularly badly-hit areas, the situation is getting worse and not better. I should like to hear what the Government have in mind, so far as it lies within their power—and I know the limitations—to alleviate the situation and to ensure that when dentists are available at all there shall be inspections within each school year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Until my hon. Friend the Under Secretary made his intervention, I admit that I had been attracted to the terms of this Amendment. The Clause of the Bill provides for inspection. The point is, after inspection, what then? What follows? My hon. Friend has indicated that Section 59 covers this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman, the Minister, in his intervention was suggesting that my consistency argument did not hold water. I accept that, so far as presenting children for medical and dental treatment is concerned, there is no inconsistency between the Act and the Bill. There is a subtle difference in the wording in terms of Section 58(3) and Section 59 of the parent Act which changes the nature of the duty, the extent of the obligation which rests on local authorities. There is a difference, it seems to me, between their obligation to provide medical treatment on the one hand and dental treatment on the other.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member has practically made the point I was about to pursue. I am not going to commit myself, but I think there is sufficient merit in this for my hon. Friend to look at it again. I would not commit myself to the Amendment, but now we have
	<span class='label label-info column'>486</span>
reached a stage in this Bill where the Minister will look at any proposals or suggestions we have to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He should look at the terms of Section 59. There are two methods, as we can see, in paragraphs (	<i>a</i>) and (	<i>b</i>) of Section 59, though it would not be appropriate for me to follow it too far. It is suggested
	<br><blockquote><p>"either regularly (whether whole-time or part-time)"</p></blockquote>
regarding dental treatment, or under (	<i>b</i>),
	<br><blockquote><p>"under arrangements made by the Regional Hospital Board",</p></blockquote>
It is on that point I would like to make a further comment in respect of dental treatment in schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) has already mentioned the difficulty in sparsely populated areas, but my hon. Friend will not be entirely unaware that even in thickly-populated areas, like the City of Glasgow, it is just as difficult to get dental treatment at the weekends: from Friday night to Monday morning. One might as well be in the Western Isles. There are children who have dental treatment during the week, from Monday to Friday. The theme song, apparently, of the dental provision in hospitals, and perhaps of my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, is "Dental treatment never on Sunday".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had Questions about this. Before hon. Members opposite think this occurs only under this Administration, there are Questions going back to 1959, 1962 and 1965, pursuing this matter of the gap which exists in the dental services and the provision of services at the weekends. In my experience there have been many complaints from parents regarding emergencies on Saturday afternoons and, as usually happens, during the night.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There should be one place, at least, even if only a small place, where it could be generally known that emergency treatment could be given. The whole point of the provisions of these Sections to help children during five days of the week is missed if they cannot receive treatment somewhere outside the school premises. I would like my hon. Friend to consider, under Section 59, either by a rota system of dentists, the dentists who are employed in the school dental service, or a small clinic in any one of the hospitals
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0715">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>487</span>
in cities which have facilities whether, in emergencies patients could go to such a place. I hope my hon. Friend will be able to add something to the points that have been raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is my hon. Friend quite satisfied with the quality of dental treatment in all cases in the service? Are there any inspectors of the inspections? There are one or two instances where parents have complained bitterly about there having been extraction rather than preservation, because of inadequate consideration of the matter. I should be glad if my hon. Friend could reassure me on some of these points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would support the hon. Member for Maryhill (Mr. Hannan). He has been pursuing an active campaign in this and, from my own experience, I would agree with him in everything he said. I had the experience some three years ago of having this kind of acute dental problem on a Saturday night. It was only through the help of the hospital giving the pain-killing drugs that I was able to go on tolerably until the Monday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under this Clause, would it be possible for the school dental practitioners to help out in some emergency service? The argument against this has been that the average person finds it difficult to visit the dental practitioner during the normal working week when it involves the former's going away from his job, or from school or college, during that time. One solution might be to make a charge of some sort, except in case of need—to make a considerable charge for such facilities. Those who suffer from the kinds of problems which the hon. Member for Maryhill has outlined would, I am sure, be only too glad to pay to make use of such facilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tne school provision is generally of a high standard and that is so in Glasgow but the problem at weekends for children and adults, is one that must at some time be dealt with. It is time an initiative was taken. The hon. Member for Maryhill was right in saying that this is not a new problem. It is a problem which has stretched back over the years. It only affects a small number of people, but to that small number it involves very real agony, pain and concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>488</span>
Through this Clause, through the school dental provision or making use of one school or college in the course of the weekend, I would hope that some kind of treatment could be made available, if need be at a very substantial charge. I hope something can be done to deal with this problem. If it could be done by means of this Clause, it would help the small minority of people who suffer in this way at the weekend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Even though the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) mentioned the word "fluoridation", I have decided not to be provoked; although my hon. Friend the Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) repeated the word I shall still not be provoked; because I do not think we should widen this debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I took part as a Member of the Estimates Committee, in the last year of the previous Government's office, in a nation-wide investigation of the Health Service, including the dental service. My recollection is that my hon. Friend the Member for Kelvingrove (Dr. Miller), who was then a member of Glasgow Corporation, attended as a witness from the Corporation before the Committee and subjected himself to the Committee's examination. It was a nation-wide inquiry which took a whole Session to complete. The record is there for anyone to see. There was much to be said, much to be inquired into, and the Report was received in the House. There was a debate later, and there was no criticism which caused the Government of the day to think of rejecting the Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From what has been said this morning there would appear to be a declension in the service which is now being provided, particularly on the dental side. That is what has alarmed me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference has been made to the provisions dentists make for the weekends. I have always thought the general service dental provision totally inadequate. I have raised that matter with dentists in Glasgow and they have given me their assurance that there is publicly exhibited in the City of Glasgow, at appropriate public places such as post offices, a list of the dentists who are on call on Saturdays and Sundays. Anybody in the City of Glasgow whose own dentist does not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0716">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>489</span>
respond to his call can find a dentist somewhere within the area within which he lives. It is a different matter if the system fails to operate, but that is the answer given by the dentist.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would remind the Committee that we are dealing with the duty of an education authority to provide for dental inspection—at appropriate intervals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is in the Islands and Highlands a special case, which was dealt with by the inquiry which I mentioned. A few years ago the case was made out, and was accepted by the House of Commons, that the medical and dental service was satisfactorily serving the public of Great Britain. We are here dealing only with Scotland. If there has been a failure of or a declension in the efficiency of the service in the intervening years, I hope that my hon. Friend will say something about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that we are all concerned about the point which was raised by the hon. Gentleman the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Hannan) about children with painful teeth at weekends who are not able to get attention either through the school dental service or through the Health Service. In such times of crisis at weekends it is not easy for a parent to know where to turn. It may be that the Minister will be able to put those worries at rest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The system works well in London because it is not considered unreasonable for one to telephone the Royal Dental
	<span class='label label-info column'>490</span>
Hospital in the evenings or at weekends and to expect to get advice. There is a telephone-answering machine at that hospital which tells inquirers who are in trouble that they can go to the Guy's Hospital Medical School which runs a 24-hour service. I know from personal experience that this system works well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like there to be something similar in Glasgow, whether through the education authorities or through the Health Service, so that parents could ring a certain number and get advice. I am certain from my own experience that a dentist, knowing a patient to be in extreme pain, would not fail to respond on a Saturday or Sunday, but many dentists do not live near their surgeries and contact with them becomes very difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will be able to tell us what facilities are available, particularly for children, and to say whether or not our fears are groundless.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment 56 is most important. I listened with interest to what was said by the hon. Gentleman the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Hannan). In the middle of last summer I was struck on a Saturday with the worst toothache I thought it was possible to have, having a short time earlier made a vigorous attack on the policies of the hon. Lady the Member for Hamilton (Mrs. Ewing). Perhaps it was a judgment upon me. I had great difficulty in getting emergency treatment. I discussed the matter with dental friends all of whom said——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. I wonder, Mr. Jennings, if you could explain to me how this can be in order in a discussion upon the school dental service. The hon. Gentleman is not at school, and the fact that he has a toothache has nothing to do with the school dental service. How does all that link up with the Amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have allowed comparisons at reasonable length, hoping that hon. Members would come to the point relating to parents and children and education authorities. I am anxious to see how the hon. Member will come to that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the mild rebuke. I was going to say that it was the opinion of all my dental friends that if treatment
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0717">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>491</span>
is carried out at regular intervals, and if children or adults have attended the dentist as regularly as they should do, there is no reason why there need be any dental emergency at weekends. I had not been to a dentist for eighteen months, and my dental friends said, "On your own head be it."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that I have taken so long to come to the point but, despite what I have heard about the need to have emergency clinics for children at weekends, I feel that if the necessary inspection and treatment are carried out at regular intervals professional advice will not be necessary outside regular visits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) raised a somewhat wider issue than that covered by the Amendment, or indeed, by the Clause as a whole, namely the arrangements for providing dental services in particularly difficult areas, and he mentioned Harris and South Uist. The question goes well beyond the school dental service, and my hon. Friend's complaint really related to the difficulty of getting dentists at all in those areas to deal with the adult population as well as with the schoolchildren.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not recollect recently any representations about Harris, though I could not be sure. I know that the point was put to my hon. Friend when he was recently in Harris, and there are two other areas in Scotland from which I have had representations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are special financial arrangements under the National Health Service which allow special arrangements to be made, particularly in the Highlands and Islands. These arrangements operate successfully at present in some parts of the Highlands and Islands. We provide arrangements, but in some areas it is difficult to get dentists to lead the sort of life which is bound to be involved for them in moving about from place to place giving treatment for a week in one place and then for a week somewhere else. Provision is made in the National Health Service, but it must be remembered that a dental practitioner is not in the employment of the National Health Service, but is an independent person in contractual relationship with the Health Service. He is not subject to a direction as to where he should practise or how
	<span class='label label-info column'>492</span>
he should carry on the arrangements which he provides under the National Health Service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A similar point can be made about the emergency services——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend say a word about the special financial inducements? The reason that I ranged more widely was that the solution to the problem of getting a dentist at all is to assure him that he will have a general adult practice as well as a school practice. Would my hon. Friend say something about special financial inducements, because obviously they are essential?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot answer offhand as to what exactly are the inducements because it is nothing to do with this Amendment; but there are financial inducements. One of the ways to attract a dentist to a difficult area is to combine his normal practice with adults with school inspection and treatment of schoolchildren where necessary. I recollect a case where my Department suggested that a way round the difficulty was to allow the school dental service to be run by the general practitioner, which made his job, in terms of time spent on the island, more economical and financially more attractive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was ingenious of my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Hannan) to initiate a discussion about the emergency dental services in Glasgow, but it is not relevant to this Clause or to the Amendments we are now discussing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The number of times I am being reminded that I am being indulgent on the Amendment tempts me to clamp down in the future. A Chairman can be carping, and stick to the letter of the rules of order and spoil the whole spirit of the Committee. I have allowed discussion to range a little more widely hoping that we would soon get on to parents and their children and education authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. With the utmost respect, I would remind the Chairman of the well-known hymn "Yield not to temptation".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do my best.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>493</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a connection in the sense that if children's teeth were better looked after it would reduce the number of occasions upon which they would require emergency treatment in adulthood, but it is a very tenuous connection in regard to the Amendment. It is not the duty of an education authority to provide an emergency dental service for people like my hon. Friend the Member for Maryhill, and I do not think that he is seriously suggesting that that is what they ought to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To answer the point made by the hon. Gentleman the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) about the adequacy of the service, I should like to come to the first Amendment about appropriate intervals. He will realise, of course, that it is necessary to have a phrase of this sort in the Clause otherwise an education authority which was so minded would be able to avoid its obligations almost completely. For example, to take this phrase, if it arranged one dental inspection some time during the school life of the child it would presumably meet the needs of the Clause. Obviously we do not want that to be the position. We want to impose a real obligation on education authorities, in the light of all the circumstances, including, in some cases, their staffing difficulties, to see that dental inspection is carried out throughout the period of a school child's life. If we were looking at the ideal situation it might be we would like to see dental inspection carried out, say, every six months, but there can be few authorities which would be able to provide an inspection service of that kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, what we have provided by the use of this phrase is the establishment of an obligation on an education authority to have a continuing interest in dental inspection without in any way trying to lay down what in many cases could only be completely unrealistic obligations which they could not meet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore our main interest must be to try to see that the number of dentists employed in the school dental service is increased so that in fact this obligation can be made a reality. At the present time the number of dentists in the school health service is 218 whole time, and 23 part time, giving a total of 228 whole-
	<span class='label label-info column'>494</span>
time equivalents as compared with the equivalent figure of 210 at the end of 1965.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman give the figures again, as it seems to me there is something wrong with the arithmetic?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The figures are 218 whole time and 23 part time, giving a whole-time equivalent total of 228, as compared with the figure of 210 at the end of 1965. So that the service is in fact improving, and one must set these figures against the number of dentists in general practice, which is just over 1,100 at the present time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore one can see that a substantial number of dentists are in fact employed in the school dental service, and one must have in mind that for many children dental treatment, as distinct from dental inspection, will be done by the dentist who looks after the teeth of the rest of the family. One must not look upon treatment as something which can only be provided by the school dentist. Doubtless the majority of the children get their dental treatment from the family dentist, if I may so describe him. So the position is improving, and I think we are providing a reasonable way of laying down the duty of an education authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to the second Amendment, I think the hon. Gentleman, originally at least, misunderstood what was being done in this Clause. If I may give the background, it was always thought, and certainly always intended, that Section 58 of the 1962 Act, which talks about "medical inspection", should also include dental inspection. In fact, until quite recently, and indeed, for that matter, until the present time, it has been believed that that is what Section 58 of the existing Act did, but one education authority has recently queried that, and said it does not accept that Section 58 imposes an obligation on the education authority to provide dental inspection as well as medical inspection. For that reason, and because perhaps the Section is not as clear as it might be, we are introducing this new Section to make it absolutely clear. The reason why it does not include dental treatment is that it was already included in Section 59 of the 1962 Act, and it was not thought necessary to repeat it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0719">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>495</span>
It gives a slightly unfortunate conclusion in that we now have medical inspection and treatment in one case in one Section and dental inspection and treatment in two separate ones, but on consolidation, which I hope will take place sometime after this Bill goes through, I think it will be possible to bring all the dental provisions together in the one Section. We did not wish to clutter up this Bill by repeating provisions about dental treatment which are already in satisfactory form in the 1962 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having given that general background, I hope the hon. Gentleman will accept that Amendment 56 is not necessary, and that what we are now providing for dental inspection and treatment is basically the same kind of provision as we are providing for medical inspection and treatment. It is true that the wording of Section 59 in the 1962 Act about dental treatment is slightly different from the wording in Section 58 (3) about medical treatment, but the overall effect is the same. We have different wording here because, of course, the dental services are different from the medical services. For example, it is true that the school dental service often provides directly for treatment on quite a substantial scale, whereas on the medical side that is not really the position. It is much more concerned with inspection, and when treatment is necessary it is either a matter for the medical practitioner or for the hospital service. The duty of the education authority is to see that there are no gaps and that treatment is always available, one way or the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will certainly look at the wording again and if there is need to get consistency I will look at it on Report, but I believe the wording is perfectly adequate at the present time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only other point I might mention is the question of bringing compulsory provisions into treatment as well as into inspection. I have already said that the position with regard to dental treatment will be exactly the same as that with regard to medical treatment, but I must also say that while it may be all right to provide for compulsory dental inspection it raises substantial questions of principle to provide for compulsory dental treatment. There is no compulsion
	<span class='label label-info column'>496</span>
in the Health Service at present with regard to treatment. If someone is ill he is not compelled to go to his doctor and get medical treatment. Similarly, if one has a raging toothache one is not compelled to go to the dentist. Indeed one is not compelled to go to the dentist to see if one needs fillings. Therefore, it would be quite wrong to apply the compulsory principle to treatment as well as to inspection. The compulsion is there with regard to inspection in order to protect the child against the apathy of the parent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the hon. Gentleman, and in particular for his last remarks. On reflection I accept completely that it would be wrong to extend the compulsion in this Clause or in these Sections to provide that children should be forced to undergo treatment, whether medical or dental.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the same time, although the hon. Gentleman dismisses it, there is a difference in the wording between Section 58(3) and Section 59, in that the education authority is required to provide medical treatment but is only required to make dental treatment available. I may be reading too much into this, but there seems to be a difference between the two Sections. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will look at that again when he is considering the wording of these two Sections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for explaining the background to the introduction of this Clause of this Bill, which, as I understand it, arises primarily because a local authority made representations to the Minister suggesting that the terms of Section 58 regarding medical inspection and supervision did not embrace dental inspection and supervision. If that is so I would have thought that even closer attention should be paid to the wording of the Section. Perhaps I am maligning the anonymous authority. It may be that its approach was simply intended to call attention to a deficiency in legislation which could be put right in this Bill. Equally it may have arisen from a reluctance to provide the dental inspection and supervision which it will now be obliged to provide by this Clause. If that is so, then clearly the extent of the obligation in Section 59 on education authorities concerning dental treatment
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0720">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>497</span>
should be looked at most carefully, and I hope the Minister will do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving the answer to the question which I raised on Tuesday about the number of dentists in the school service, and I am glad to see there has been a small increase over the last four years. I agree that it is important to relate the numbers in the school dental service to the numbers of dentists outside the school service. It would have been even more significant to have related the numbers of dentists in the school service to the numbers of children at school. I hope the Minister will work out those figures, because I shall be asking him about them in a Question shortly. If he has the information today, perhaps he will give it. How many children are there per dentist?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one final question which perhaps I could raise now, although it would be more appropriate on the Question, That the Clause Stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That depends on whether we have a debate on the Question, That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Possibly that is all the more reason why I should try to slip it in now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. Slip it in now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to ask the Minister what consultations he has had with the British Dental Association about this Clause. My understanding is that there has been none, at any rate in Scotland, and if that is so it is a matter for some surprise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may answer those two points, I am not aware that there have been consultations, and I am not really aware that they have in fact been necessary, because we are not dealing with a new obligation on education authorities but simply a clarification of the law. I will check that point, but I do not think anything arises under this Clause which would affect the dental profession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the number of children per dentist, I know that so far as the general dental services as a whole are concerned there is one dentist for every 4,653 of
	<span class='label label-info column'>498</span>
the population at present, which includes children as well as adults. If one looks at the figure of 228 and compares it with a school population of between 800,000 and 900,000 one sees that the proportion is not substantially different from that for the adult population as a whole. One also has to consider that those dentists in general practice are providing treatment for children as well as inspection, so I do not think we can say that there is anything like a critical situation in the school dental service, although there are areas where certainly we would like to see more dentists being made available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the Minister for what he has said. In view of the wide-ranging and generally helpful debate we have had, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We come now to Clause 11 in which one would naturally expect a very substantial debate. On a previous occasion we were able to have a very wide discussion on an Amendment or Amendments and no discussion on the Motion, That the Clause stand part of the Bill. In view of the wide variety of Amendments here, and the fact that blacks are very difficult to distinguish from the whites because of the greys, it may be wise—I am making this suggestion to the Committee—to make very brief speeches on the Amendments and have a very full and wide discussion on the Motion, That the Clause stand part of the Bill. If that meets the wishes of the

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Esmond Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 34, in page 9, line 26, leave out' may 'and insert' shall'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I endorse what you have said, Mr. Jennings? I believe that meets the wishes of the Committee and I shall myself try to set some example by way of brevity. I begin by saying, as we are in the middle of the eleventh Sitting and have reached the eleventh Clause, I trust that there is no danger of our being here for a thirtieth Sitting dealing with the 30 Clauses in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me say at the outset that I am delighted to see, sharing my concern with this Amendment, the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Hannan) who has put his name to the Amendment, without any concerted planning on the part of either of us. Perhaps this demonstrates the concern we feel about this Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As you yourself have said, Mr. Jennings, next to Clause 1 this is the basic Clause in the Bill. I believe it is a much less contentious Clause than was Clause 1, but in putting forward this Amendment, I must tell the Minister that, subject to what he says by way of reply, I intend to press it, because I feel that it is a very important Clause. I know I am speaking for my hon. Friends in saying that our intention here is to strengthen the Bill. We are not seeking to make any carping or niggardly points—I am trying to remember the adjectives used by the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis)—but trying to help the Minister and to improve the Measure by the proposals we are making.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that once one begins to talk of the problems of handicapped children, whether handicapped mentally or physically, one enters very difficult country. This is a sensitive area. I do not want, and I am sure hon. Members will not want, to start citing the host of case studies which could be brought forward, arising constantly in surgeries. I want to look at this not only objectively but clinically, if that is the appropriate word. Perhaps I could most usefully indicate the points I wish to raise on this Amendment by putting them under three heads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>500</span>
There are three reasons why it would strengthen this Bill if the word "shall" were there. First, of course, there are the precedents. In all preceding legislation the word has been "shall". There has been a specific obligation on the Secretary of State to make recommendations defining categories of pupils. This was so in the very first Act in 1945, which was the pioneer Act where mentally and physically handicapped children were concerned. This obtains, as the Minister realises, in the 1962 Act. I would like to know from him when he replies why he made this very curious change, weakening the powers of the Scottish Office in this regard. I believe it would be a source of great strength if the word "may" were replaced by the word "shall".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I move this Amendment for the second reason that, as the Minister knows far better than anyone else, there has been a whole series of investigations into this field since 1945. I recall at least seven working party reports prepared between 1945 and 1954. I recall also the circulars issued as a consequence, all indicating the concern of government, central and local, with the problems of handicapped children. I remind the Minister that under the Mental Health (Scotland) Act, 1960, the duty of education authorities was extended, in reporting children, to include those between the ages of 2 and 5 years who came to the notice of education authorities. It may be that here one is reaching the reason why the word is "may" and not "shall" in this Bill; because the striking feature is in new Section 63, where there is power as regards children under 5 but a duty, as at present, for children over 5. I imagine that it is because of that Section 63 providing a power but not a duty for the under-fives that the Minister replaces "shall" by "may", presumably because he is not aware of, and cannot get, the information on the situation family by family where handicapped children are concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first point I am suggesting, therefore, is that he is departing from his own legislative precedents by making this change, and, I believe, weakening his own capacity to help handicapped children and especially handicapped parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point I wish to adduce to make my case is that one finds that, next
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0722">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>501</span>
to Clause 1, this is, as I believe, the major Clause in the Bill. In my view the Bill will in future become known far more significantly for Clause 11 than for the changes recommended in Clause 1. As hon. Members know, it makes a substantial alteration to the 1962 Act as far as the assessment of handicapped children is concerned and provision for their education. It does so at a curious point in time, because we have just legislated another Measure, the Social Work (Scotland) Act, which in some degree is bound to be coupled with this Bill in that there is to be, to use a cliche, a single door on which everyone can knock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is increasing concern in child guidance and maternity clinics with paying attention to handicaps from which a child might suffer. The effect is to widen the Clause and therefore to widen the scope of the Act when the Bill becomes an Act of Parliament. I believe there is here a fundamental problem as to the relationship between the obligation on the education authority and the obligation on local government through the social work provisions. The striking feature is that Section 63 bears on Section 62 and one cannot consider these two words without the distinction between power and duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would suggest to the Minister that it is fundamental in our attempt to help handicapped children to try to get information as early as possible; and my basic criticism of this Clause is that it is so permissive where the 2 to 5 year olds are concerned. We have spoken repeatedly about the emphasis running through all the Working Party Reports on the importance of early treatment, and there is the Minister's own emphasis on the need for early discovery and treatment of situations in particular families. On Clause 1 we have spoken of age, ability and aptitude. I am suggesting that here there is an equal obligation with regard to children who are handicapped in one degree or another. We have to try to assure to them an education equal to that we are giving everyone else; and it seems to me that this cannot be done by setting at the age of 5, simply because that is the age at which children go to school, this curious distinction between the permissive and obligatory side.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>502</span>
There is a further reason in terms of the Measure itself why we should strengthen the Minister's hand. Section 62 and the subsequent Section is an attempt to investigate the mind of a child by insisting on psychological as well as medical examination. This is important and very difficult. I believe—and everything I have read on the subject and all those to whom I have talked confirm this—that the sooner we can get the situations family by family before the age of 5 the better. The second point that I suggest to the Minister, therefore, is that not only in terms of precedent but also in terms of the content of the Bill itself there is an overwhelming case to be made for strengthening it on these lines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, I try to look ahead, because in his replies on Clause 9 the Minister, very properly, I believe, foresaw the day when we would have to be thinking in terms of 1972–73, the raising of the school-leaving age and so on; and we have to consider the kind of situation into which we are moving so far as mentally or physically handicapped children are concerned. I believe there are going to be many more children in our society suffering in one degree or another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to develop this point along morbid lines, but by sheer chance, in a curious letter which reached me, and, presumably, all my colleagues, this morning, headed "The Unwanted Child", there appears the sentence:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The science which Galileo Galilei brought into the world four centuries ago has now discovered three methods of ending the human race—the bomb, the germ and the pill."</p></blockquote>
I do not want to sound morbid, but if one looks at statistics over recent years it is quite clear that, roughly speaking, 1½ to 2 per cent. of all the children who are bom suffer from some degree of handicap. As the population in our schools increases those children will increase in numbers, and the proportion will increase because of the increasing degree of medical attention to be given to them at birth and in their early months. One could strengthen the argument by referring to the thalidomide problem and the consequences that produced. It may well be that such a situation could never recur, but we do not know what impact drugs are likely to have on births.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may reinforce this point, to which I shall return on a later Amendment, by noting what has struck me very
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0723">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>503</span>
forcefully in my own constituency, the isolation of young parents with large families—the absence of granny from the home, the fact that a family is now increasingly isolated and desperately in need of guidance and help, not least in this field, the anonymity in housing schemes, and, perhaps, our own society. In my observation we must add the fact that—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, with respect to the hon. Gentleman.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the point, Mr. Jennings, and I shall be very brief indeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I simply want to emphasise, as the third strand of my argument, that in the world into which we are moving a great many more of these cases can occur than have occurred thus far. I believe that many families are less prepared to cope with them than they have been in the past. In these situations there is an extra dimension of involvement by the mother, of a defensive sort. It is as if she had an extra dose of love to pour out on the handicapped child. For this reason we should not be put off by the difficulties of getting (information about this. I believe it would strengthen the Minister's hand, and would strengthen the Bill, if the word, "shall" replaced the word, "may".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At first sight, I am slightly surprised that we should have the word, "may", rather than the word, "shall", but in a matter like this—and I agree as to its importance—clearly the Minister and the Department must have good reasons for their attitude. I wonder whether, in order to help the coherence
	<span class='label label-info column'>504</span>
of the debate, we might ask the Minister to give the reasons for his thinking and for that of his Department?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My name is put to the Amendment but I had kept my seat in order to facilitate the proceedings, but if there is to be a debate I want to get into it, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have an obligation to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Hannan), because at a previous Sitting he very kindly restricted his remarks to a very few moments, on a promise from me that on this Clause he would have very full scope. I shall be placed in some difficulty if the debate on this Amendment is to be full and wide-ranging. It means that we shall be restricted on the Question, That the Clause stand part of the Bill. So hon. Members have to make up their minds. This is a point which the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill, is validly making. He is in a difficulty. Should he make a full-blooded speech on this Amendment, or reserve himself for later Amendments or for the Question, That the Clause stand part of the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not make a full-blooded speech. The simple point here is that, if the imperative is used in Section 63, why should there be only the word, "may" in Section 62, which concerns the important regulations governing Section 63? Let us all confess that there has been this argument in Committees over the years, about the words, "may" and "shall".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Time after time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am merely asking out of curiosity why in Section 63 there is the imperative, but only the word, "may" in Section 62.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to say that I cannot find any imperative in Section 63. In fact, it does not deal with regulations. It does not even mention the Secretary of State. So I am not quite sure what that argument means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a very narrow point, and simply turns on the question of the way in which we express legislation. This point has been made countless times to this Committee, and no doubt to other Committees, but the way in which we have expressed legislation in recent years is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0724">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>505</span>
to say that the Secretary of State may make regulations. That does not mean to say that he is any less likely to make regulations than if the word "shall" were used. This is the normal wording. We already have Regulations under the previous legislation, and these Regulations will be protected under this Clause. I assure hon. Gentlemen that, in practice, it makes no difference at all whether we have "may" or "shall" here. But for consistency I must ask that the Committee retain the word "may".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Clause 1, which is very important, in new Sections 1 and 2, which deals with the widest range of Regulations about education, and which is the Section under which the Schools (Scotland) Code and countless other Regulations are produced, we use the word "may" and not the word "shall". It is simply a question of wording, and I hope we will not make the mistake of confusing the wording here with any real issues on other parts of the Clause. I assure the Committee that this is simply following the standard wording about regulations, and it is used in legislation at the present time. There is nothing sinister about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Brewis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is the case, why has the Minister changed the wording of the old Section of the 1962 Act by the Section he is putting in here?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The 1962 Act is a consolidation Act, which I think dates from 1946. What I was saying was that in recent legislation—and this applied when hon. Gentlemen opposite were in office, as well as under this Government—it has been the practice, for consistency, to express these regulation-making powers in terms of, "the Secretary of State may make regulations".

	<p>the situation. If regulations are required under this Clause to supplant and supersede existing Regulations, which are of course protected, the Secretary of State will certainly make them. I hope we will not confuse the merits of this Clause, taken as a whole, which raise a whole lot of important issues which I should be very glad to see debated, with something that is only following normal drafting practice and makes no difference at all to the real situation.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Small</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the Minister's interpretation of "may" and "shall". But if the word "shall" were used I should feel compelled, in terms of "several categories", to delete "several", and to insert "all". This would create greater difficulty, because we cannot talk about "several categories" with a definitive need, and must take out the word, "several". So I accept the Minister's interpretation, and the fact that other difficulties are created by using the word, "shall".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take it that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary is telling us in slightly different words that "may" includes "shall".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I confess that I am in some difficulty here, as I do not understand the Minister's argument. What it comes to is that he is saying that "shall" is the same as "may", which simply does not make sense. The word "shall" implies obligation, while the word "may" implies permission. If the 1962 Act now reads, "The Secretary of State shall make regulations", then I feel that it will be weakened if it reads, "The Secretary of State may make regulations". It is as simple as that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I now call Amendment 35 and with that I think it will be convenient for the Committee to take Amendments No. 36, in page 11, line 15, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>(	<i>e</i>) inform the parent of the facilities specified in subsection (2) of the preceding section.</p></blockquote>
and No. 37, in line 40, at end insert:

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment 35, in page 10, line 4, after 'need', insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>' on the availability of child guidance services under the foregoing provisions of this Act, on Social Work Departments established under the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 and on the Scottish Society for Mentally Handicapped Children '.</p></blockquote>
I shall be very brief indeed and will try to follow the various adages that have been thrown about this morning. I simply say that these three Amendments are designed, as the Minister will appreciate, to strengthen the Act in terms of the information services available to parents who have handicapped children in their families. This Section 62 is, of course, new, and it is in order to strengthen it that I am suggesting the Amendment. All three Amendments are to strengthen the new provisions. I suggest to the Minister that there ought to be a very much better service of information available to parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind him of the figures which were given in an Answer by his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, that at January, 1968, there were 11,820 children on the rolls of education authorities in grant-aided special schools, and 947 of those were resident. In recent years the average number of children reported to local health authorities as unsuitable for education training in special schools, has been of the order of 170 a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This number could increase, and parents in this situation need all the help which can be given. The old family doctor tends to be disappearing and some of the family services which are available, and which do such splendid work, ought to be brought in to help in this field. I am a little concerned that the information which has come to me suggests that there was very little consultation with some of
	<span class='label label-info column'>508</span>
the voluntary societies, particularly with the Scottish Society for Mentally Handicapped Children. At a point when we are seeking to widen this whole field through the Social Work (Scotland) Act provisions, and are seeking to give much more information to parents, these three Amendments would strengthen the Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In my experience, the information services are rather good in this field. I should have thought that, often enough, the best thing to do would be to have a private interview with the headmaster concerned, rather than have any sort of formal organisation, because in this field, of all fields, the informal is often more effective than the formal. On the second point, I do not want to start a Departmental conflict, but could my hon. Friend say with which body he did have consultations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could not give all the organisations which have been consulted about this Clause, but we did have consultions with education authorities, directors of education, the teachers' organisations, and so on. Hon. Gentlemen will know that there has been some representation from the Psychologists' Section of the E.I.S. about other aspects of the Clause. We had all the appropriate consultations about this Clause, though I cannot say we necessarily consulted with the voluntary organisations about aspects of it. For reasons which I shall explain in a moment, I would not look upon that as being a serious criticism and really not a criticism at all of the Government so far as this is concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the Clause says at the moment is that it should be the duty of the education authority to let information be known about the importance of ascertainment of any child who is likely to require special education, and of the fact that ascertainment procedures are available at any age, not just at the school age of 5. That is important, and that is an obligation which one ought to put on the education authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must remember that what we are dealing with in this Clause, the whole of Clause 11, is the ascertainment procedure for children who are likely to require special education and not matters a good deal wider than that. For example, there is mention in the Amendment of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0726">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>509</span>
child guidance services. The child guidance services are involved in dealing with large numbers of children, who are not involved at the time they become, as it were, clients of the child guidance service and are not likely to be involved, in special education, far less reporting to the social work department. It is inappropriate to mention the child guidance services here. If one wanted to put any obligation on an authority to publicise the child guidance services it would have to be done in another part of the Bill. I very much doubt whether that is necessary, because every classroom teacher knows of the existence of the child guidance services, and it is not necessary to put advertisements in the newspapers saying, "There is a child guidance service available". That is completely inappropriate. With the social work department one must remember education authorities are not necessarily the same authorities as have responsibility for social work. We argued this at considerable length a year ago. The large Burghs which are not education authorities have the responsibility for the social work department and it is really for the authorities responsible for the social work department to publicise their activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one is dealing in this Clause with a child who may not be making very good progress at ordinary school and who may just conceivably be a case for a special school it is not really appropriate to be informing his parents about the facilities available under the social work department. which would only be involved if the child were found to be ineducable to an extent which did not make him suit-able even for a special school. One would get real difficulties here with parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regarding Amendment 36, apart from the fact that it would introduce the necessity to inform the parents at the wrong part of the Bill, it would in any case introduce an element which, in many cases, would be completely inappropriate and, far from reassuring parents, would excite them to think the situation which they were already worried about to be perhaps even more worrying than they thought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To take the question of the Scottish Society for Mentally Handicapped Children, I would not like anything I say to underestimate the work done by that
	<span class='label label-info column'>510</span>
Society, because I know something of it and I have very great admiration for the work it does, but it will be appreciated that it is impracticable to mention one voluntary body within an Act of Parliament in this way, even if it were appropriate. There are many other bodies concerned. It would be particularly inappropriate to mention a body which deals only with mentally handicapped when these ascertainment procedures apply in very many cases where there is no question of mental handicap—perhaps physical disability, psychological maladjustment, deafness or blindness. One does not want to convey to the parents that special education is only concerned with mental handicap, though large numbers of the pupils who are at special schools do suffer from mental handicap.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I appreciate the intention behind the Amendments, and while I certainly accept the need to let the possibilities that will be provided under this Bill be known in the widest possible way, I think the Amendments are misconceived.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far as the under 5 year olds are concerned, particularly in the cases of the more severely handicapped, I believe it is very much more a question of making sure general practitioners who are likely to come into contact with these children are aware of the possibilities of services and assessment being available to them at a very early age. This applies particularly in cases of deafness where it is very important indeed to get the deaf child under some kind of education as soon as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that the Amendment is appropriate for the purposes which I know the hon. Gentleman has in mind. I hope with that explanation he will be willing to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for that very helpful reply, especially regarding what he said about the voluntary societies as a whole. They do a splendid job in a field where, as described by the hon. Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell), informality is desirable. Such societies are approachable in a way many more official bodies are not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would suggest to the Minister, however, that there are two points which his reply did not really cover. The first is the pre-5-year-olds. I am very concerned about this 2 to 5 year old category into
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0727">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>511</span>
which we are now moving and in particular the problems of deafness. If one had to pick out any single disability which affects all other aspects of disability, it is deafness, and the slow discovery that it is deafness which is the cause of the disability that most needs ascertainment. It would be very helpful if the Minister, in his guidance to the Department, could press this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second is simply my general concern with the lack of residential facilities. This would take us into a very much wider field. We need many more resources here, not only voluntary but official, for the provision of residential facilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the point the Minister has made, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brewis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 40, in page 10, line 33, leave out 'either or both of the examinations' and insert 'the medical examination only'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an Amendment to the next new Section, Section 64, which deals with the examination of children and provides for a medical and psychological examination. In respect of these two examinations it is said that the parents may be present at both. I am sure everyone would agree that the parent of a young child ought to be present at the medical examination. It may well be, however, that slightly different considerations apply to a psychological examination. Most psychological tests now lay down conditions of administration which specifically preclude the presence of a third party to the examination. In many cases it would be impossible to obtain a valid result if the parent were given the right to be present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, since it is the essence of a psychological testing that the child is put in a situation which is new to him, the presence of parents would tend to destroy the basis of most standard tests and destroy the validity of the tests. Secondly, the presence of the parents, it is well known, could in many cases itself invalidate test results, due to almost unavoidable transmission of anxiety or interaction between parent and child. In effect, therefore, this proposal in the Bill could produce a result detrimental to the best interests of the child.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>512</span>
I would not pretend to be an expert on psychological examinations but this Amendment is supported by the Psychologists' Section of the E.I.S. It is a science which is growing and has perhaps been neglected somewhat in the past. I would like to know if the Minister would consider this Amendment or give his reasons why he cannot do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope my hon. Friend has something favourable to say on this. I have had the same representations as the hon. Member for Galloway (Mr. Brewis).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is represented to me that going to medical examinations is one thing, but in psychological examinations carried out by an educational psychologist—and I hope we understand the term correctly, that it is an educational psychologist—there can be an embarrassing situation where a child is so dependent on the parents, or the other way about, that excess of affection affects the child. This could be quite embarrassing and not helpful in the best interests of the child.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope the Committee will appreciate why the Clause is drafted in the way it is at the present time. We are very concerned, in the whole of this Clause, to give the maximum amount of parental rights. We want the parents to be involved at every stage, and we want the parents to have a right at appropriate stages to appeal to the Secretary of State, and so on. It was on the line of that general philosophy, which permeates the Clause, that this subsection was put in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, I do appreciate that there may well be circumstances in which it would militate against the validity of the psychological examinations if the parent were entitled to be there. I would not say that in every case he ought to be excluded but that is rather different from saying he ought to have a positive entitlement to be there, which he will have at the medical examination. There may be instances in medical examinations where it would be better if the parents were not there. I would hope that in those circumstances, by mutual agreement, the parents would not be present for particular parts of the examination, especially when one is dealing with older children as one might be under this Clause. That is something that can be easily settled on the spot in the few cases where it is likely to arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0728">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>513</span>
It is rather more difficult to persuade a parent who wishes very much to be present at a psychological examination that he really ought not to be there, and for that reason I have much sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it does have the general agreement of the Committee—and I am not suggesting all the other Members of the Committee should get up and say it does—I can give the assurance that, if the hon. Gentleman withdraws the Amendment now, I will see that an appropriate Amendment is put down on Report. This Amendment is not quite adequately drafted, and there are one or two consequential Amendments to be made later on in this Clause, and elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In answer to one other point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Hannan), the way the Bill is at present drafted the psychologist would be an educational psychologist, but there is Amendment 52, which would insert "or clinical" psychologist, because there may be cases in which it would be a clinical psychologist rather than an educational psychologist who would be the appropriate person to conduct the examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, to the E.I.S., and to a number of other people who have drawn our attention to this point. I am willing to make the change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brewis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for the favourable way in which he has received the Amendment. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>514</span>
I beg to move, Amendment No. 44, in page 11, line 31, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>(	<i>b</i>) the views of the parent of the child, so far as these can be obtained;</p></blockquote>
The Clause, in line 42, on page 11, says that the education authority may consult the parent of the child. It gives the impression that in making an assessment an education authority makes up its mind and, in the light of all the information, consults the parents. That was not the intention of the drafting of the Clause. It was the intention that the views of the parents and any consultation with the parents should be part of the ascertainment procedure to be taken into account before ascertainment is made. The wording is defective in new Section 65(1) and Amendments 44 and 45 put the matter right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, Amendment 46, to new Section 66B, clarifies the wording by removing the reference to consulting the views of the parent of the child and inserting the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"the views of the parent of that child, so far as these can be obtained".</p></blockquote>
This gives a much stronger protection to the parent concerned.
I hope that the hon. Gentleman the Member for Galloway (Mr. Brewis), will accept that we have, by the Government Amendments which we are now discussing, taken the sense of his Amendments 41 and 42, and that it will not be necessary for him to move them. We feel that our wording protects the position rather better than his wording.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment 60 deals with the review by the education authority in the case of a child who has been previously ascertained as requiring special education. We are in the Amendment taking account of the views of the parent of the child in the review procedure itself. The wording has to be slightly more lengthy and complicated because there may be cases where an education authority will review the case of a child receiving special education without the necessity of a medical and psychological examination. The parent may not be involved in any way since it may be a normal process of review carried out by the education authority. In the matter of a psychological and medical examination, it will not be necessary to disturb the parents in order to get their views. It

	<span class='label label-info column'>515</span>
may be burdensome to a parent to be asked for his views in a situation where he has not asked for a review where there is no examination and where, at the end of a day, the determination is likely to be simply that the child requires special education. Amendment 60 substantially improves the right of the parent by making sure that, either where the parent has asked for a review or has been asked to submit the child for medical and psychological examination, his views are to be taken into account before the review procedure is carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that this series of Amendments will be accepted as improving the rights of parents. I have taken the injunction put to me at an earlier stage to look again at this Clause 11 to make sure that it is well drafted. In the light of that review, I have had inserted certain additional rights to parents which I am sure will be acceptable to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with most of what the Minister has said and it is very helpful for these Amendments to be made. However, there are two matters about which I am not happy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first relates to Amendment 60. The Minister said that on many occasions when only a minor reassessment would be involved, and the parent did not request any review of the child's position, it might be burdensome to the parent to have to be consulted. That is a reasonable point of view, but it is surely possible that even in such a review as that which had not been requested by the parent a decision could arise which might change the future of the child or the pattern of its education. Should not the parent be consulted on decisions which may affect a child's future? Would the Minister reconsider this matter?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second matter relates to Amendment No. 44. It seems strange that the views of the child's parents are to be ascertained" so far as these can be obtained". One can imagine circumstances in which it would be difficult or impossible to obtain the views of the parent, and I accept that some qualification is necessary, but if it is necessary, in Amendment 44, why is it not necessary in Amendment 45? Amendment 45 says baldly, "after consulting the parent of the child". What is to happen when the parent of the child is not able to be con-
	<span class='label label-info column'>516</span>
sulted say, for example, because he is absent?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, could the Minister assure me that throughout the Clause the word "parent" includes "guardian" where that is the more appropriate person to consult?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to take up the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) about the meaning of the word "parent". Amendment 44 is obviously right in proposing that an education authority shall take into consideration the views of the parent. What does the word "parent" in this connection mean? The Interpretation Clause at the end of the Bill, Clause 27, says that
	<br><blockquote><p>"… expressions used in this Act and in the principal Act have the same meaning in this Act as in that Act".</p></blockquote>
In the definition Section of the Education (Scotland) Act, 1962, Section 145, "parent" is defined as including
	<br><blockquote><p>"'guardian and any person who is liable to maintain or has the actual custody of a child or young person ".</p></blockquote>
This raises a doubt in my mind. A child suffering from some disability could have a close relationship with its mother and a less close relationship with its father. Whose views would be taken into consideration by the local authority, those of the father or those of the mother? It is important that in this delicate matter both parents should have an equal right to have their views considered by the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that the Interpretation Act, 1889 lays down that the singular embraces the plural. In terms of that Act "parent" would therefore mean "parents" and to some extent my point would be covered. For the sake of clarification, the rights of both a child's parents to be consulted should be clearly established.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This continuing extension beyond the existing provisions of the Bill becomes a little unnecessary since it raises all sorts of other questions. It is not unusual for a young child not to be very fond of its father or its mother but to be fondest of all of its granny. Are we going to consider including the granny in the consultations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Three points have been raised. The first was raised by the hon.

	<span class='label label-info column'>517</span>
Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) about the wording of Amendment 60. I have explained why the Amendment is so worded, but the hon. Gentleman was rather afraid that there would be circumstances in which a decision might be taken about a child which the parent might consider detrimental without the parent being able to do anything about it. That is not the case. If there is any question of continuing the decision the parent has to be informed under the earlier parts of the Clause. If there is any question of a decision that the child should receive special education, there is provision for the full rights of the parent to be available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we are dealing with here is simply the review, which, since it does not involve a medical and psychological examination, is not likely to be a full scale review of a child's circumstances. We are allowing authorities to do that, and in fact we expect them to do it. We impose a duty upon them to keep the children under review to make sure that they are not misplaced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it does not require a medical or psychological examination, and if the parent has not asked for the review to take place, we are simply upsetting parents unnecessarily by asking for further reviews as to what should happen to the child. We should be creating uncertainty. We must strike a balance between the rights of the parents to be fully informed and, on the other hand, the necessity not to disturb parents in cases where it is unlikely that there is a need for them to be disturbed at all, and certainly where there is nothing to be done with regard to the child which the parent could consider detrimental.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for Amendment 45, I think the hon. Gentleman misread that. We are eleminating the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"after consulting the parent of the child"</p></blockquote>
and therefore the question as to whether or not one can obtain consultation no longer arises. On the question of whether we "should have the words qualifying the views of the parent of the child
	<br><blockquote><p>"so far as these can be obtained"</p></blockquote>
I think we required those words to be inserted. In normal circumstances there
	<span class='label label-info column'>518</span>
will be no difficulty, but when dealing with mentally handicapped children one is sometimes dealing with mentally handicapped or mentally inadequate parents and it may not be easy to get coherent views from a parent as to what should be done in the way of ascertaining or reviewing the position of the child. We are imposing an obligation on the authority to approach the parents and obtain their views, but there are cases where it will be difficult to do that and therefore we need this qualification. In the vast majority of cases there should not be any difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The word "parent" includes both parents, a guardian, and the rest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the hon. Gentleman say why that is?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is as the hon. Gentleman himself said; it is in the Interpretation Act, 1889.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far as other relatives and other people may be concerned the Clause is expressed in the broadest terms. I think one should first look at new Section 65(1), which is the ascertainment Section, and one will see there that in subsection (1)(c) there is the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"any other reports or information which they are able to obtain … ".</p></blockquote>
If this is a case where the child has been living with his grandmother or where some friend of the family is well aware of the circumstances the education authority can obtain a report from those people; indeed such people can volunteer a report to the education authority and it will be taken into account. It is impossible to define in the Bill all the circumstances in which individuals with an interest might be taken into consideration. One must protect the rights of the parent, but one is not in any way excluding reports or information which could be given by any person who may have been involved, including, in some cases, a Member of Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

[	<i>Interruption.</i>] I do not want a discussion on this, but, drawing on previous experience, particularly on the Finance Bill last year, that an hour is too short, although an hour and a half appears to be too long for some people, I am suggesting an hour and a half for a break, if it happens that we are to go on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be brief on this point. It is simply a logical follow up from everything the Minister has said upon his own four Amendments. If we are allowing more frequent opportunities for review ought there not to be more frequent opportunities for the review of a child's situation at the request of parents? I appreciate that in the parent Act of 1962 the period is 12 months, and this Bill keeps it at 12 months, but I believe there should be the opportunity for a review at six-monthly intervals. We all know that at times, although on all too infrequent occasions, there are dramatic changes in a child's mental condition, and I believe it would be better to have the opportunity for a review in a shorter period.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must ask the Committee not to accept this Amendment. In my view, we must strike some kind of balance here. It is perhaps worth pointing out to the hon. Gentleman that under the present provisions of the 1962 Act, which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0732">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>521</span>
go back beyond that Act, once the initial decision has been taken that a child requires special education, and the parent has not exercised—or indeed even where he has exercised—his right of appeal there is no further requirement on the part of the education authority to review the child's case, and, indeed, the parent has no further right during the child's school career. As the ascertainment may be at the age of 5 and the child may stay at school till the age of 16 there is the whole period of 11 years during which there is no duty to review on the part of the education authority, and no right of appeal by the parent. The education authority, which is carrying out its obligations responsibly, will certainly, even at present, be reviewing such cases, but I am pointing out that the statutory rights we are giving to parents here are substantially more than is provided under the existing legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think to provide the opportunity for a review once a year is reasonable from the parent's point of view: to provide for a review once every six months, with an ultimate appeal to the Secretary of State after the review, would be impracticable, and certainly from the point of view of the child himself. It is not sensible to have a child's future reviewed twice a year. It would be upsetting, it would disorganise the school to some extent, it would create uncertainty in the minds of the parents and of the child, and would be undesirable. In this Clause we have gone far to meet anything which could be considered a legitimate right of parents in this matter. A review every 12 months is reasonable, but beyond that we should be creating an impossible position for the child himself and for the persons having charge of him, whether at a special school or anywhere else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I simply say that behind what the Minister is saying, much of which I accept, I hope there is not here a core of administrative difficulty? I hope the reason is not the unwillingness to stage the review, but that it is genuinely motivated by the unrest that this could cause for individual children and parents. I believe there is a case to be made for this Amendment in the sense that there is real parental anxiety, and to wait for a periodic 12 months is a little like a penal sentence being imposed.
	<span class='label label-info column'>522</span>
However, I accept the points made by the Minister, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing here with the question of review by the education authority of a child who has been reported to the local authority as unsuitable for education or training and where, as a result of the review, it has been decided that the child is still unsuitable for education. Under this category a review can be initiated by the parent, the local authority responsible for the child or by the institution which has the child under care. In the course of the review there is a requirement for a medical and psychological examination, as the hon. Gentleman the Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) will see on reading this Clause, as compared with that we were discussing before. This is a definite requirement, because one is dealing with instances where the child has gone outside the sphere of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0733">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>523</span>
the education authority so that the education authority cannot have a review without a fresh medical and psychological examination. In those circumstances the parent is necessarily involved in the process, because he has to be invited to have the child medically and psychologically examined. If he refuses there are certain sanctions which can be applied to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Clause as it is drafted at present the only person who would be entitled to receive notice of a determination not to cancel the report, that is, allowing the child to remain as he is at present, would be the person by whom the review is requested. Obviously, this would not necessarily cover the parent of a child who may not himself have asked for the review. This Amendment puts right that deficiency by bringing all the persons referred to in paragraph (i) into the Clause. All these persons should come into the notification for which we are providing under paragraph (iii) which in particular brings the parent into the reckoning.

This is purely a drafting Amendment, but it also makes some little difference.
	<span class='label label-info column'>524</span>
We are dealing now with children who are leaving school and who may benefit from services which are provided by a local authority, in this case for young persons suffering from mental deficiency. The wording of the Clause at present speaks of the local authority having power to provide these services, but there are already certain services for which there is more than a power with the local authority, where there is, in fact, a duty imposed upon it to provide services. That applies particularly with regard to services in training for occupations for persons suffering from mental deficiency over the age of 16, in terms of the Social Work (Scotland) Act. Thus, we really require here a word or words to cover both powers and duties. By leaving out the word "power" and inserting the words "the function of a local authority" we cover both terms and therefore make it absolutely clear that here we are dealing with all the functions of a local authority with regard to persons suffering from mental deficiency so that we are in fact improving the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I at this point widen the discussion a little? We are now looking at this Clause which, I think you will agree, Mr. Jennings, has been amended with considerable speed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Agreed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This amended Clause now gives rise to two or three points which I can perhaps best put to the Minister in the form of questions to which I would appreciate his reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been discussing the whole provision of facilities for special education, to use the words of the 1966 Education (Scotland) Report, and the first question I would put to the Minister, in the hope of obtaining from him some degree of satisfaction, is on our capacity to provide the services in the special schools from now on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have in front of me figures given by his right hon. Friend in reply to a Question of mine on 24th February. These figures show that there are 731 certificated teachers employed in education authority and grant-aided special
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0734">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>525</span>
schools; and that at January, 1966, the latest date for which the age distribution is available, 53 per cent. of the certificated teachers in special schools were 50 years of age or over and only 8 per cent. were under the age of 30.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have done some breakdown of these figures, and the proportion is even worse. I understand that at the present moment 284 teachers in special schools are over the age of 55 and 381 are over the age of 50. That is to say, about one-half of the teachers in special schools in Scotland are over the age of 50. I would press the Minister on the urgency of recruitment or training for special schools. I believe this is a fundamental matter which concerns a great many of us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I press the Minister on what I have implied in earlier remarks, the shortage of residential accommodation. Here we are coming to one of the nubs of the problem, our ignorance of the need for provision for mentally handicapped children before the age of 5. Running through all our discussions on the extension of the provisions of the Act there has been—and it is a very healthy thing—a concern that we do not know the situation, we do not know the number of children physically or mentally in need of assistance. We do not even know the number of parents, except as they come to us or through the voluntary societies. We are aware of the shortage of the residential accommodation and the shortage of facts, and I would suggest to the Minister that we need a great deal more information on this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point is that I would have liked to have seen a sharper appreciation—less perhaps in the actual words in the Bill than in the method of coming to write them down—of the importance of consultation with voluntary societies. I believe it is here that the great breakthrough has been taking place since 1945. There is a great deal to be done by closer association with the host of voluntary societies, and I would welcome the Minister's views on this point also.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So far as teachers in special schools are concerned, this is an area of difficulty. That is one of the reasons why the special arrangements
	<span class='label label-info column'>526</span>
about reference panels apply to special schools as well as secondary schools generally, even where a special school happens to be a primary rather than a secondary school. The special points of difficulty do not apply everywhere with equal emphasis. There are areas where there are no particular difficulties here or elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is probably true to say, as a general statement, that such particular difficulties as we have with regard to teachers in special schools are largely a reflection of the general staffing difficulty in schools in the education authority area as a whole. Those who are teaching handicapped children are expected to have an additional qualification though not all of them have it at present. That applied even before they were certificated, now registered, teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is rather worrying that we should have this particular age distribution, but it has to be borne in mind that many teachers go into special education after having taught in ordinary schools for many years. In other words, this is a particular vocation, which does not necessarily come to the teacher who has just left training college. If one talks to teachers, headmistresses, and others in special education, one very often finds the same kind of pattern. Their normal classroom experience over a period of years has given them a special interest in the needs of children who are backward or have other kinds of disability; and it is on that basis that they have gone into special education, and subsequently, when they are in the service, have obtained the qualification. The age distribution factor, therefore, can be a little misleading, and must take account of the fact that the entry of teachers into special education is not quite the same as entry into normal schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would not my hon. Friend agree that it is far more satisfactory that this should be the position? It is highly desirable that special teachers should have some experience in the ordinary classrooms beforehand, and that they should not go to a special school straight from a training college or even for two or three years afterwards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a very important point. I absolutely agree with my
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0735">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>527</span>
hon. Friend that a good backing of experience in the ordinary school is very important here; and we do not want special schools to be looked at in a completely separate category from the ordinary schools. The kind of movement we have at present is not a disadvantage but a positive contribution towards the staffing of special schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
