<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Dr. J. Dickson Mabon)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Mallalieu, may I express the deep appreciation of the Government and, I hope, of the Opposition, for your arrival.</span></p>
<p><i>Resolved,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That during the proceedings on the Electricity (Scotland) Bill the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock.—[<i>Dr. Dickson Mabon.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman (Mr. E. L. Mallalieu)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the first Amendment, I would remind the Committee that there is a Financial Resolution in connection with this Bill and that copies are available for Members if they wish to have them.<br><br>
I should also like to call attention to the fact that adequate notice should be given of Amendments. As a general rule I do not intend to call, and I do not think that your real Chairman will call, those that are given in manuscript.</span></p>

EXTENSION OF BORROWING POWERS OF SCOTTISH ELECTRICITY BOARDS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. J. Bruce-Gardyne</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 1, line 11, to leave out from 'million' to the end of line 13.<br><br>
Would it be convenient, Mr. Mallalieu, if the Committee were to debate with this Amendment the Amendment, in page 1, line 13, at end insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"but such additional powers shall only be used to raise money by stock issues, and not by Government advances"</p></blockquote>
with provision for a separate Division, if necessary?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that would be for the convenience of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Dickson Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have no objection.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, Mr. Mallalieu. That will save time and will possibly avoid confusion, although the Amendments are not on exactly the same point.<br><br>
I want, first, Mr. Mallalieu, to express my own thanks to you for arriving this morning. I do not know what would have happened to my Amendments had you not arrived. I am delighted to be able to argue them under your Chairmanship and not to have to face the prospect of having to be here so early on another Tuesday morning.<br><br>
The Amendments require a little background explanation to make their purpose clear to the Committee. The first is designed to require the Government to return to Parliament before the proposed new interim limit of £700 million on the borrowing powers of the South of Scotland Electricity Board and the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board is reached. The second Amendment is designed to require the Boards to borrow for their requirements, within the limits proposed in the Bill, exclusively by stock issues.<br><br>
For reasons which I shall explain, it would not be my intention, though I cannot speak for my hon. Friends, to press the second Amendment to a Division. Whether I press the first Amendment to a Division will depend on the Minister's reply.<br><br>
Broadly speaking, the purpose of both Amendments is the same. It is to limit the access of the Boards to the Government's printing press. At Second Reading I expressed the hope that Mr. Goode of the I.M.F. would not have his attention drawn to the Bill during his visit to London last week. In the event I cannot help wondering whether his attention was not drawn to the Bill because I note with interest that he decided that his regular visits of security, of which last week's was supposed to be the last, should be continued into next year. I cannot help wondering if he was not motivated in this very understandable decision by a scrutiny of the Bill.<br><br>
If Mr. Goode's attention was drawn to the Bill and to the accompanying Memorandum it is hardly a matter of surprise that he should have felt it necessary to continue and extend the probationary
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1344">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
period to which Britain is at present subject. He would have read in paragraph 3 of the Memorandum—Cmnd. 3806—that the Government had to come back to the House to seek new borrowing limits for the two Boards, because the Boards had obtained smaller contributions than forecast from internal resources. He would further have read, if he referred to the debate on the Electricity (Borrowing Powers) (Scotland) Order, that the main reason why there was the shortfall in ploughback was that Ministers had intervened and frozen prices. If Mr. Goode had got thus far in his examination, he might further have reflected that if the Bill went through as proposed by the Government, and without Amendment, there would be nothing to prevent Ministers from using their power of the printing press under the Bill to freeze prices in the electricity industry in Scotland till another £250 million had been run through. Finally, Mr. Goode might reflect that this contrasted a little oddly with the Chancellor's promise to limit growth of the money supply, and in particular with the intention expressed by the Chancellor in the Budget and since to curtail private consumption by keeping the advance of earnings behind the advance of prices.<br><br>
It is for these reasons that my Amendments are designed, to use one of the nautical metaphors so beloved of successive Chancellors, to keep us more nearly on course. That broadly is the background against which I ask the Committee to consider these Amendments.<br><br>
10.45 a.m.<br><br>
I ask the Committee to consider the second Amendment first. Its intention is to restrict future borrowing by the S.S.E.B. and the North of Scotland Hydro Board to stock issues. I first ask the Minister of State—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether my hon. Friend will get an answer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I may not get an answer. Nevertheless I ask, what was the latest date of the two Boards' £94 million worth of stock issues detailed in paragraph 2 of the Memorandum? Am I right in thinking that they pre-dated the issues to 1955? I think probably they
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
did, for I notice that in paragraph 87 of the Radcliffe Report on the Workings of the Monetary System it is stated that the practice of stock issues by nationalised industries was effectively abandoned in that year because,
<br><blockquote><p>"the authorities experienced increasing difficulty in selling natonalised industries' stocks to the public"</p></blockquote>
and found that stock was increasingly left in the hands of the Government broker.<br><br>
During our debate at Second Reading the Minister of State promised to let me have details of the extent to which it was expeoted that the proposed new borrowing powers under this Bill would be used in the form of stock issues. In the event he failed to do so. I do not criticise him too severely for that because I recognise that he was working against the clock then, but I hope that he will do so now because it is important for the Committee to have a clear answer. I take it that the answer will be "Not at all" for the same reason that led the Treasury to abandon stock issues in 1955, except that those reasons would apply with all the greater force today with war loan hovering around 44 per cent. on a good day.<br><br>
In a perfect world I would press the second Amendment to a Division with great enthusiasm. I believe that one way to limit the extravagant growth of the public sector—with the accompanying effects of inflation, loss of confidence in money, and the balance of payments strain, all of which spring essentially from the growth of the public sector far outstripping the growth in the private sector in recent years—would be to require the Scottish Electricity Boards, in company with the other nationalised industries, to raise their prior charge capital demand without the intervention of the Government broker's safety net. Undoubtedly they would then have to pay considerably more for their money.<br><br>
[Miss HARVIE ANDERSON <i>in the Chair</i>]<br><br>
At this point, Miss Harvie Anderson, I welcome you to our deliberations and also thank our temporary Chairman for assisting us this morning.<br><br>
I was saying that in a perfect world I would have pressed the second Amendment to a Division with great enthusiasm. I should like the Electricity Boards to be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1345">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
required to raise their prior charge capital in the market without the intervention of the Government broker's safety net. Undoubtedly, in such circumstances they would have to pay very much more for their money. I imagine that the going rate would be about 12 per cent. This would force the abandonment till easier times of many worthwhile projects which they have in mind. That is a regrettable but inevitable concomitant of the progress of putting our economy back on the rails.<br><br>
I was interested to see that in the First Report of the Select Committee on Nationalised Industries, to which the Minister of State referred me, in paragraph 625, it is stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Committee have therefore concluded that there is no point in changing the present system of borrowing long-term from the Exchequer. And even if market borrowing were possible, they see no real advantages, and several disadvantages, from the industry's and the Treasury's point of view—not least (for the industries) that the price of capital might be higher than the price at present charged to the public corporations by the Treasury."</p></blockquote>
It might indeed. The Report says, in paragraph 627:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Committee have not considered these problems in detail. They appreciate that the industries"—</p></blockquote>
that is, the nationalised industries—
<br><blockquote><p>"have not, in recent years, experienced difficulty in raising from the Exchequer, at favourable rates, the volume of capital they require for their approved investment."</p></blockquote>
That Committee seemed to think this an admirable state of affairs, but I am inclined to disagree. Unfortunately, we do not live in a perfect world. We live in a world in which, if the S.S.E.B. and the Hydro Board were to issue stock to the public, the Government broker would have to be sent in to mop it up as a drug on the market. This would achieve nothing at all. The right answer would be to take the Government broker out of the market. Then the industries would have to pay a realistic price for the money they raise. Alas, we cannot discuss that proposition in this Committee. For that reason I argue that, as we can do nothing under the terms of this Bill to rectify the situation, I would not wish to press that Amendment to a Division. It is designed for a perfect world and we live in an imperfect world.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Archie Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member's whole case has been to substantiate the views he has expressed before and to try to limit growth at present in the public sector. I wonder where he draws the line. Would he include injection of millions of pounds in advance factories to private industry being sited in Scotland to help to reduce unemployment, or housing subsidies—all of which come out of the public purse and are things which people want and need—or is he excluding those things?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I went into all the various subjects mentioned by the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel) you would have to rule me out of order, Miss Harvie Anderson. To give the hon. Member a short answer, I say that broadly speaking my answer would be yes—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Oh!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</span><span class='membercontribution'>: —but I do not think I had better pursue that any further.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should be delighted to pursue it in public or private, but if I did so in this Committee I should soon be ruled out of order.<br><br>
Before I try your patience too far, Miss Harvie Anderson, I had better turn to the first Amendment. Its purpose is to require the Government to come forward with a fresh Bill when the proposed interim limit of £700 million is exhausted. The distinction here is a fairly narrow one. It is as to whether the Boards should be empowered to carry on right up to the ceiling of £800 million subject only to approval of the last £100 million by an Affirmative Resolution—I think the Minister of State will confirm that it would be by Affirmative Resolution—or that we should have another opportunity to look afresh at the whole situation.<br><br>
There is an important distinction here. We are choosing an odd moment to commit ourselves to an extra £250 million of output from the Government printing press including, incidentally, power to the Boards to raise money overseas. The last point admittedly seems pretty academic at present. I cannot see foreigners entrusting their funds to our nationalised industries under this Government in the present state of the economy, but in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1346">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
theory this provision could lead to an inflow of hot money. I should have thought we have had enough trouble about that in the past. In that context, also, we should keep the Government on a very short rein, and that is the purpose of the first Amendment. I do not think this is the time to raise the borrowing limits of a nationalised industry by £250 million. We should content ourselves with £150 million at this time. It is a vast enough sum, in all conscience, at a time of soaring and, so far as one can tell, uncontrolled growth of public spending.<br><br>
I said in my opening remarks that whether or not I press the first Amendment to a Division depends on the reply given by the Minister. If he can give me an absolute assurance that the interim limit of £750 million will not be exceeded before March, 1971, I shall be happy to withdraw that Amendment. The significance of that is that it will be the latest date by which the next Tory Administration could take over. I recognise that, once they have taken over, entirely different circumstances will apply. I have every confidence that my hon. and right hon. Friends will not need any closer scrutiny of their activities in this context than that which would be provided by an Affirmative Resolution in the terms of the Bill as unamended. Unless the Minister can give us such a clear and specific assurance I would wish to press this Amendment to Division, because I do not believe that this is the moment to budget for an increased output of £250 million from the printing press.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Doig</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Bruce-Gardyne) has clearly shown by these Amendments what his priorities are. He objects to the possibility of extra money being raised for a very essential industry, essential not only for the public but for the development of other industries. It seems strange that the hon. Member has advanced no argument against this, he has not put forward any argument to show that the Boards do not need this money, yet he objects to the power being given to them. That is a strange attitude to adopt.<br><br>
11.0 a.m.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman gives the show away with the second Amendment. This
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
reveals that he is not really concerned with whether the industry develops or not, but with ensuring that its profits go to those who can buy shares or stocks in it. He even explains that this would mean, by his estimate, an interest rate of about 12 per cent. He agrees that this is much higher than would otherwise be necessary.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman also agrees that it would mean that the industry would have to postpone desirable and necessary extensions. That was an extraordinary statement. He wants to hold back "necessary and desirable developments", to use his own words, in an industry which is essential to almost every other industry. Very few industries do not require adequate electricity supplies.<br><br>
It is neither unusual nor unexpected for hon. Members to hear such views from the hon. Gentleman, but the public should certainly know the kind of priorities he has in mind. We have been accused of seeking nationalisation by the back door. A fair description of the hon. Gentleman's proposals would be denationalisation by the back door. He is concerned to create an opportunity for people to invest in and exploit a highly necessary industry, and he wants all this solely so that investors can extract an interest rate of about 12 per cent. It is a remarkable but clear explanation of his sense of priorities, and I am sure that the public will be interested to hear them. I want all the money that may be necessary to be available to the industry because of its importance to other industries. If the second Amendment means that the industry would have to postpone desirable and necessary extensions, I am opposed to it and I hope that my hon. Friends will take the same attitude. However, it is enlightening to have heard the hon. Gentleman's remarks. I am sure that they will be carefully conveyed to the public so that the people may know his sense of priorities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The most wounding part of the speech of the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Bruce-Gardyne) was not his own words but the interruption by the hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro), who said, <i>sotto voce,</i> as far as he can make <i>sotto voce</i> comments—I hear most of them—something to the effect that the hon. Gentleman probably would
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1347">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
not get an answer anyway. That is really hardly so. I devoted one sixteenth of my speech last Tuesday, if it can be called a speech, since it was extremely rushed in a very brief period, to answering the hon. Member for South Angus. He was kind enough to acknowledge that my speech had to be rushed.<br><br>
I was unable to give the breakdown of figures, but had I had more time I would have referred the hon. Gentleman to the Memorandum, where the breakdown is laid out. He wanted more information and I will come to that aspect in discussing his second Amendment, but I thought that after our debate he would have gone over his papers again, and have seen that he could have found all the references he needed in the Memorandum. In the final stages of that Sitting I said that I hoped that we would return to this matter in Committee. I said it twice. I therefore am neither surprised nor disappointed that the Amendments are down. I welcome them because it gives us a chance to discuss these important points. I would only add, however, how ungrateful is this bite from the serpent's tooth.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The breakdown of past borrowings is in the Memorandum but, last Tuesday, I asked for the Government's estimate of comparable breakdowns for the future—the divisions between Government advances and stock issues. That is not part of the Memorandum.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will come back to that aspect in discussing the second Amendment. The last stock issue was in 1955. The idea was dropped in 1956. and this decision was later confirmed by the Radcliffe Committee and again recently by the Select Committee on Nationalised Industries. There will be no further stock issues under this Bill. That is our intention. By using the Memorandum, the hon. Gentleman can easily project what the structure will be during the period of the Bill, to run till 1974.<br><br>
I regarded the hon. Gentleman's speech, particularly in relation to the second Amendment, as a slight venture into Powellism. I would not like to think that the hon. Member is completely allied to the right hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Powell). In-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
deed, I have never believed that. But in financial matters his proposals today seem to be a slight venture into Powellism. I do not regard the issue on the second Amendment as being very serious at this juncture.<br><br>
However, on the first Amendment I was alarmed when the hon. Gentleman injected into his argument about Parliamentary procedure political overtones about 15th March, 1971, in what was meant to be a dire threat to the Labour Party but which will cause concern in the minds of all those who serve the Electricity Boards that, somehow, something terrible will happen to the Boards in Scotland if, by some calamity, there is a change of Government on 15th March, 1971. If the hon. Gentleman has read the speeches of the right hon. Member for Enfield, West (Mr. Ian Macleod) he will have seen that the Government's term of office runs into April, 1971, taking into account the time taken for the Dissolution of Parliament, which must be 31st March, 1971, at the latest. Thus, the actual date could be 21st April, 1971, for the next election, and it is possible that the Government may go the full length in order to ensure that they get a handsome majority once more.<br><br>
Seriously, however, the hon. Gentleman put an alarming argument—that somehow, if there were a change of Administration, there would immediately be a change in financial arrangements. On the present evidence, such changes could considerably harm the Boards.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman cannot get away with this. It is not what I was saying. I said that, under the next Tory Administration, because the whole context of public sector expenditure will be brought under proper control—which it is not today—obviously the background situation will have changed and the need for the Government to come back to the House with a fresh Bill instead of simply seeking an Affirmative Resolution for existing borrowing limits will have disappeared.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept that. In Clause 1, we are making provision for financing power stations which take from five to seven years to plan and build.

Bill. I have had experience of coming to office where little legislation had been prepared, and, of course, having been in Opposition, we encountered the same difficulty that the present Opposition encounter in that we could not have legislation ready. It is not easy to bring in Bills in the first Session of a new Parliament. The hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Gordon Campbell) used to pull my leg, quite rightly, about the Rivers (Prevention of Pollution) (Scotland) Act, which was prepared in the Department while he was Under-Secretary of State. One cannot at the drop of a hat switch over legislatively or in Parliamentary terms. If the hon. Gentleman's arguments have any merits, they will take some time for his party to digest.<br><br>
The second Amendment is the more important of the two. In a perfect world, the hon. Gentleman would divide the Committee, but, since the world is imperfect, he will not be able to do so. That is another way of saying that his hon. Friends will not support him at this stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not mind whether they support me or not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is brave but alone.<br><br>
The fact is that the Conservative Government in 1956 decided that there should be no more stock issues, and did so for good reasons. In 1959, the Radcliffe Committee, set up by the Conservative Government to examine the whole range of finance with particular reference to the nationalised industries, again came solidly out against the idea of stock issues. In the First Report of the Select Committee on Nationalised Industries, issued last July, our own colleagues gave a multitude of references as to why, in their opinion, at this stage—for nothing is permanent in life—it would be wrong to go back to the scrt of measures proposed by the hon. Gentleman. He was fair enough to quote certain paragraphs of the Report and I want to refer to preceding paragraphs now, in order to show the depth of feeling there was in the Select Committee about this matter.<br><br>
In paragraph 622 the Committee stated:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"The Committee see some of the attractions from the industries point of view, of borrowing from the market. For example, it could give them greater flexibility in timing and in settling the terms of loan capital to suit their special requirements. But the Committee feel that some of the arguments in favour of this proposal are misconceived."</p></blockquote>
It goes on to explain why this is so, in paragraph 623:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Committee fear, however, that even the attractions of going on the market may be illusory. The Treasury evidence, quoting the Report of the Committee on the Working of the Monetary System (Cmnd. 827), showed how the earlier system of borrowing on the market with Treasury guarantee had failed to work properly."</p></blockquote>
It refers to the evidence quoted on pages 9 and 10. We cannot go into that now, but this was the finding of the Radcliffe Committee and of the previous Government, and our own colleagues have confirmed lit. The Report went on, in paragraph 624:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Treasury consider that the idea of the industries borrowing on the market without Treasury guarantee was unrealistic. The Committee concur."</p></blockquote>
I rest my case on that. The Conservative Government twice examined this matter and our own colleagues in this Parliament have also recorded their views that it would be wrong to do it. In view of all this, it would be wrong to single out Scottish Boards for such a change. I go further. Without a general change coming about, it would be wrong to single out any particular boards for it.<br><br>
I understand that at present certain nationalised industries have the right to raise capital in this manner, but none has ever used its powers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Which are they?</span></p>
<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have the reference here. The air Corporations are one example, and several other nationalised boards have the same right. So far, they have never exercised that right.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman must argue his case much more intensely and more expertly among his own colleagues first if he is ever to have this sort of financial discipline, as he calls it, reintroduced for the nationalised industries should his own party ever come to power again. Although the second Amendment represents an interesting exercise, I am just as glad
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1349">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
that we are not to have a Division this morning, thus leaving the hon. Gentleman, whose sincerity I fully appreciate, completely isolated in this imperfect world.<br><br>
To return to the first Amendment, which has taken on a seriousness which I had not fully appreciated. I thought that it raised an argument about Parliamentary control, and, as a House of Commons man, as I like to think of myself, I am most anxious to try to meet objections on that ground. The Electricity and Gas Act, 1963, which the party opposite brought in, established a borrowing limit of £580 million, which we are shortly to reach, with an interim limit of £500 million. The debate which we had in November, 1966, was on an Order raising the figure to the absolute limit of £580 million. There may be an argument—I thought that it appeared at Second Reading—that we are wrong in our figures here, and that we are asking a bit too much in going up from £700 million to £800 million as opposed to £500 million to £580 million—that we are asking for £20 million more—but we are taking into account here the increases which cover re-borrowing which does not count against the actual limit under the 1963 Act. That figure is £37 million. So, I am asking the Committee to agree that the borrowing figure should be £700 million, later perhaps to be raised by order to £800 million, but within that figure, unlike the situation under the 1963 Act, we should have that special £37 million. In other words, we are asking for less than the Conservatives asked for, when, quite properly, they wanted to have their Order under the affirmative procedure—I confirm that this also will be an affirmative order—discussed in the House of Commons.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister ought not to make comparisons with 1963, for the simple reason that the situation has changed. At that time public sector spending was in control. Now it is not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a bald assertion which is not substantiated by the facts. I can understand the hon. Gentleman's embarrassment when I cite the practices of his own Government, but, as he has shown in his second Amendment, he is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
hopelessly out of line with his own colleagues, though I do not blame him for that because he is at least consistent in both Amendments.<br><br>
The fact is that the nationalised industries, and these Boards in particular, are doing very well, and it is a bit hard on these two, which of all the nationalised industries have done spectacularly well, to say that we shall not go through with the whole programme, even though there is Parliamentary scrutiny, and we shall introduce a Bill. The hon. Gentleman is being a little unfair on these two Boards in appearing to discriminate against them.<br><br>
I can understand that it might be argued that we ought to have more debates about electricity. All I can say is that a great deal of the Parliamentary time available for debating the Boards' Annual Reports is to the hand of the Opposition as well as to the hand of the Government. Perhaps on the Estimates days or in the matter days we ought to look at opportunities for debating the Annual Reports and accounts of the two Scottish Electricity Boards. It is a long time since we debated the Hydro Board as such, and it is even longer since we debated the South of Scotland Board's report. It might be better to debate electricity in that atmosphere than in the rather circumscribed atmosphere of a borrowing powers Bill. I put that suggestion to the Committee.<br><br>
A debate on a borrowing powers order is not perfunctory. This was shown by the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn on the last occasion when we had such a debate. The Order covered both England and Scotland, but the lion's share of debate was taken by the Scots. I do not complain of that; it was much to our credit; but we did debate this matter for nearly two and a half hours and had a very useful discussion. It is reasonable that we should have an order of this kind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suggest to my hon. Friend that he is taking the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Bruce-Gardyne) much too seriously. He is not as sinister as he sounded. His view is quite simple. He believes that everything in the garden would be lovely if a Conservative Government were back in office, and all he is saying by his first
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1350">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
Amendment is that he would trust a Tory Secretary of State and give him power to bring in an order under the Affirmative Procedure but he is not prepared to trust the present Government. He does not go beyond that. That is what his argument boils down to.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I have taken the hon. Gentleman too seriously, but I thought that he argued his case with great sincerity. Obviously, he believes in both Amendments.<br><br>
As I say, I was prepared to answer the first Amendment on grounds of Parliamentary convenience, but I hope that the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn, as the official spokesman of his party today, has noted that a Division on the first Amendment would carry with it a good part of the argument of his hon. Friend the Member for South Angus, particularly in his closing remarks, and would represent a grave challenge to the future of the Electricity Boards. I hope, therefore, that, although we may continue a consideration of these matters as we proceed this morning, there will not be a Division on either of them at the end of the day.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall make a brief intervention in this interesting discussion between my hon. Friend the Member for South Angus (Mr. Bruce-Gardyne) and the Minister. My hon. Friend is rightly concerned that there should be strict financial disciplines for Ministers, particularly in the economic circumstances of today. The Minister will be the first to agree that this is a time of financial stringency for the country as a whole. We have had a useful discussion on the Amendments. In the House the Chancellor of the Exchequer and other Ministers have made clear their concern about the control of Government expenditure.<br><br>
The Bill does not require expenditure up to these limits to take place. They are limits to borrowing, and there is no need for them to be reached if circumstances do not require it, although, as the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum shows, they are based on estimates. However, as both sides agree, and as was emphasised in the House two years ago in the debate to which the Minister referred, in questions of power production and demand it is difficult to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
look with certainty very far ahead. This is why it is so important that there be some flexibility and why decisions by the Secretary of State in authorising projects of investment at various times are of such moment.<br><br>
Because future Secretaries of State must take those decisions in the light of all the latest technical information available as well as the assessments made, I believe that it is better to allow the discretion which the Bill would give to future Secretaries of State. As has been said, we do not know who will be the Ministers responsible when these limits are reached. It is important that they have some such discretion as the Bill provides. I do not say that because I have overnight been overwhelmed with great confidence in the present Administration, but I exhort the Government to treat these decisions extremely seriously, recognising, as my hon. Friend has plainly told not only this Committee but the House itself on many occasions when he has made his valuable contributions to our discussions on economic and financial affairs, that decisions by the Secretary of State on investment and expenditure by these Boards are of enormous importance. In my view, the flexibility proposed in the Bill is, on the whole, preferable and better than requiring a future Government to come back to the House of Commons with a Bill, with the attendant difficulty of finding a place for it in the legislative programme.<br><br>
None the less, it is true that an order provides opportunity for only limited time—about two and a half hours last time—on the Floor of the House. The Minister was good enough to say that we had made a valuable contribution—my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North (Earl of Dalkeith) and several others of my hon. Friends as well as myself—in the earlier debate, but we were fortunate on that occasion in having time on the Floor of the House at a reasonable hour and in not having to compete with other business. I cannot regard that as so satisfactory a discussion as a Bill would provide, but I consider, nevertheless, that to be dependent on a Bill in order to provide more flexibility in the higher limit is not essential.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for South Angus, in giving us a chance to discuss these matters, has done a useful service
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1351">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
to the Committee, but I am not myself persuaded by his arguments to the extent of wishing to change the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Lawson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In my view, the Amendments put to us by the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Bruce-Gardyne) ought to be replied to rather more from the standpoint of comparisons and the question of value for money. The core of the hon. Gentleman's argument—it is a view which he expresses practically all the time—is that the nationalised industries give bad value for money. On this occasion, when we are considering the limited sphere covered by the South and North Scottish Boards, his argument is that the nation gets bad value for money just the same, and his effort is to circumscribe as much as possible the borrowing powers of the Scottish Electricity Boards.<br><br>
11.30 a.m.<br><br>
If we take the measures, perhaps the crude measures, available to us, we find that we get good value for money. The usual measure here is the gross return on capital employed. The current report of the Hydro Board shows that the gross return on capital employed is 7·7 per cent. For the South Board it is 11 5 per cent. These arguments do not mean a great deal unless we are able to make some kind of measurement.<br><br>
I have been looking up the position of one of the great enterprises which the hon. Member for South Angus would hold in very high esteem and would put forward as a model for the nation. I refer to I.C.I. According to a fairly extensive report on this concern and which appeared in the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 5th November, 1967, the gross earning on capital employed in it was a fraction over 8 per cent. Over about six years, this had been the kind of earnings of this model of private enterprise efficiency. It was functioning under the great Sir Paul Chambers, who was constantly lecturing the nation and public enterprise on efficiency. Under the great Paul Chambers, I.C.I., with about £1,200 million worth of capital, was earning about 8 per cent. and doing substantially worse than the South of Scotland Board.<br><br>
I hoped that my hon. Friend the Minister of State would have given us a few more details showing how excellent are the financial results of the two con-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
cerns we are considering, despite the fact that they carry so many social obligations. We cannot fairly judge these enterprises unless we taken into account what they are expected to do and to provide. When we bear in mind the huge outlay of capital on a new power station, the last Report shows that about £97 million is tied up earning nothing. That is a fair point to take into account. There is constant pressure, certainly from people represented by hon. Members opposite as well as from people represented by hon. Members on this side, to extend the area of supply to connect electricity to even the most remote houses and farms. This costs a great deal more than it can ever earn. I raised previously the fact that the Hydro Board apparently performs an extensive service in the replenishing the rivers with fish. We all know something about the hatcheries and the great service rendered in this connection. My hon. Friend the Minister should put this into the balance. I am anxious to know what it costs.<br><br>
If the Hydro Board can earn 7·7 per cent. on its capital, it is doing even better than we thought. Does the hon. Member for South Angus think that the area which he represents and the north of Scotland would have any hope of being supplied with electricity as extensively as it is unless it were done on the basis of a service such as this? He should not only withdraw but apologise for his assertions about these two excellent concerns which function so admirably and render such an excellent service in Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman spell out the assertions which he claims I made against these two institutions?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lawson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's whole approach was one of criticism of these concerns and that the nation was getting poor value for money and we should, therefore, do all we can to limit the size of the loan and circumscribe their ability to obtain money. If the hon. Gentleman is not arguing that the nation is getting poor value for the money invested in these concerns, I cannot see any sense in his argument. The nation is exceedingly well served by the Hydro Board and the South of Scotland Board. I hope that the Committee will ensure that they are speedily given the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1352">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
money which they are so well able to use.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I first mention, more or less as a point of order, Miss Harvie Anderson, that at the beginning of our discussion I asked Mr. Mallalieu whether we could have a separate vote on the two Amendments?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman (Miss Harvie Anderson)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Motherwell (Mr. Lawson) seems to have made up his mind that I was accusing the public sector of inefficiency. That was the gravamen of his attack on me. In fact, that was not the basis of my case at all. The basis of my case was that expenditure in the public sector was growing, is growing, was out of control, and must be brought back into control, and that for these reasons it was highly undesirable that we should give the extended borrowing powers proposed in the Bill.<br><br>
The Minister of State made one point which I entirely accept. He suggested that it would be quite wrong to single out the Scottish Electricity Boards for treatment of the kind proposed in my Amendments. I accept that entirely. But he will understand that under the Bill we can discuss only the two Boards. I would not single them out for special treatment. Indeed, I would accept—and here I go some way with the hon. Member for Motherwell—that many other nationalised industries are far more seriously open to the accusation of gross inefficiency than the two we are considering. But these are the two sectors of the nationalised industries which we are considering; we cannot consider others under this Bill. That is why my Amendments relate to them.<br><br>
Since the Minister referred to the Radcliffe Committee and the Report of the Select Committee on Nationalised Industries and their conclusions from the experience of stock issues in the period up to 1955, it is important that we should be clear as to why the practice of stock issues terminated. It was because the Government, a Conservative Government, which I freely admit, were not prepared to operate in what I suggested would have been a perfect world. In other words, they threw the Government broker
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
in, and it was because he was being landed with all the paper that the system of stock issues was terminated. But I made it clear that in a perfect world I would see the Government broker out of the market and then the issues would have to find their own level. It is precisely because we do not live in a perfect world, and nothing to do with the views which may or may not be held by my hon. Friends, that I do not intend to press my second Amendment to a Division.<br><br>
Another point which should be brought out and which perhaps I failed to bring out is this. The emphasis in the Report of the Select Committee on Nationalised Industries and in the Radcliffe Report is that the right way for Ministerial financial control to be applied is in investment programmes and not in the cost of those programmes. In a perfect world, that might make sense, but for various reasons the Government have lost control of these investment programmes and are unable to keep them in line with what the growth of the private sector of the economy can continue to sustain. It is because investment control seems to have broken down that we must think in terms of borrowing control.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Since the Report of this debate will be read by many in the industry, I should like the hon. Gentleman to develop that last point in specific reference to both of the Boards. In his opinion, to what extent are the investment programmes of the Boards out of control? Where are they wrong? Where should the Government intervene to control them? The hon. Gentleman must, in fairness to himself as well as to us, explain that in a little more detail.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that I must, because to make the accusation that the Boards' investment programme is out of control would be doing precisely what I said I did not intend to do, namely, single them out for special criticism. My point is that the investment programme and spending programme of the nationalised industries have been allowed to get out of control—and not only the nationalised industries, but the public sector. I am trying to put a spotlight on an example which I do not suggest is necessarily the best, but it happens to be the one before us today.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1353">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
I revert to my first Amendment. I said that if the Minister of State would give an assurance that the interim limit would not be breached before 15th March, 1971—and I freely admit that that may not be precisely the right date to take, but, as the hon. Gentleman agreed, that is a relatively insignificant point—I would be prepared to withdraw the first Amendment. He did not give any such assurance.<br><br>
11.45 a.m.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Gordon Campbell) suggested that the Bill did not require the borrowing limit set out to be reached. That is true. He also suggested that the Secretary of State should have a certain discretion. That depends upon who the Secretary of State is and how he has used his discretion to date. The Minister of State said that there was the possibility of discussion under the Affirmative Resolution procedure. I accept that.<br><br>
Nevertheless, I believe that in present circumstances we should not give the green light to an expansion of £250 million in the activities of the Government printing press. For that reason, although I cannot speak for my hon. Friends, I myself am prepared to press the Amendment to a Division.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Bruce-Gardyne) has put on the record some of his beliefs which must be replied to. The hon. Gentleman is so wrong in his thinking that he requires a little education. He made it clear that he wants to limit the public sector; he would deliberately withhold borrowing powers designed to enable this sector, as far as it relates to the two Boards, to expand. He says that there is much more growth in the public sector—of course in reference to the two Boards—than there is in the private sector.<br><br>
Does not the hon. Gentleman recognise that growth in the private sector will be limited unless initiative is given to the Highlands and Islands Development Board, which is endeavouring to locate industry in the Highlands and in the crofting counties? The motive power for the whole of light industry is electricity. Because of the hon. Gentleman's enmity to so-called nationalisation or public
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
ownership, he would also restrain the private sector.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman is far apart from his hon. Friends, because the Tory Party accepts that there should be a South of Scotland Electricity Board and especially a North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board which will take power and light to the inaccessible Highland areas where it would be unprofitable for private enterprise to tackle the job. The same principle applies to transport in areas where it is not profitable for private hauliers to go, but that subject goes outwith the scope of the Bill.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Motherwell (Mr. Lawson) said, there are certain on-costs which the Hydro-Electric Board carries and which private enterprise does not carry. I would like to know what the total costs are to the Hydro-Electric Board of preserving amenities in connection with impounding water, the construction of reservoirs, and so on. There has been enormous expenditure to meet and placate the opinions emanating mostly from Highland lairds, not so much from tourists. We can all see the heirlooms bequeathed to us by private enterprise when, especially in its older activities, it was not concerned with amenity but only with extracting all possible wealth, whether in shipbuilding, mining, or any other industry. We can see these monuments which are a disgrace to Scotland.<br><br>
We have willingly imposed on the two Boards this burden in relation to preserving amenity. I am in complete accord with my hon. Friend the Member for Motherwell that we should do more in relation to stocking fish. It would be very revealing to be told what compensation has been paid to private owners for the loss of fishing rights. I do not think that they have lost these rights, but large sums in compensation have been paid for harnessing waters for hydro-electricity in the Highlands.<br><br>
Possibly we should praise the hon. Gentleman for providing this opportunity to put these things on the record, as he has had the opportunity to put his views on the record. The hon. Gentleman loves democracy, but he does not love it sufficiently to agree that a Labour Secretary of State should have the power by Affirmative Resolution to ask for a further sum. He would limit democracy;
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1354">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
he would not allow the House to argue whether the sum would be needed. He wishes to institute a dictatorship and say that the House of Commons shall not discuss this, because his first Amendment would deprive the House of the opportunity of discussing it.<br><br>
However, the hon. Gentleman says that if by 1971 there is a Conservative Government and a Conservative Secretary of State, on that assurance—I do not know how he could get such an assurance—he would not press the first Amendment to a Division, because he could trust a Tory Secretary of State. I do not know if he knows who would be the Tory Secretary of State. Hon. Members opposite are all good fellows, but when people</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. G. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No one could say that my hon. Friend the Member for South Angus (Mr. Bruce-Gardyne) has not shown that he has the courage of his convictions. He has enabled a debate to take place on financial philosophy.<br><br>
We now move to the core of the Bill, because the Clause seeks to provide the higher borrowing limits. In the Grand Committee the Minister of State was not able to reply to a number of points. I do not blame him for that. There was some trouble as to the time when the meeting had to end. We knew that there would be the opportunity, in the debate on this Clause, for many of those points to be dealt with. At this stage we have the opportunity to consider the investment and expenditure of the Boards and general matters connected therewith.<br><br>
Earlier today the Minister of State said that he welcomed opportunities to</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
<p>are put into a position of power we have to get beneath the good fellow, because the Whips are brought into the matter. Possibly the hon. Gentleman has not conferred with the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Gordon Campbell) who, I am certain, would have kept him on the rails. The hon. Member for Moray and Nairn is an old local authority man, as I am.<br><br></p>
<p>If the first Amendment is pressed to a Division, I believe that we should reject it.</p>
<p><i>Question put,</i> That the Amendment be made:—</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 2, Noes 9.</p>
<p>discuss these matters. For that reason I am sorry that there are no Liberals here, because I understand that they stated that they did not wish to be represented on the Committee, which seems strange, in view of some of the complaints we have had in the past about whether they should have a representative on one of these Committees.<br><br></p>
<p>We now have an opportunity of raising general points about the generation and distribution of electricity in Scotland. I believe that it will be convenient to the Committee if I raise some general points now to enable the Minister to reply to them, because I know that some hon. Members have special points connected with these new borrowing limits which might more conveniently be raised later.<br><br></p>
<p>In the short time available to him two weeks ago the Minister was not able to reply to the questions raised on the main projects which are now building or in prospect, namely, Cockenzie, Longannet and Hunterston B. These are major electricity generating stations which account for a large amount of the proposed investment. Cockenzie has run into troubles. We understand that hairline cracks were found and that commissioning was delayed. I hope that the Minister will be able to tell us more about the situation and the prospects
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1355">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 27</span>
there. We were glad to note that there is a bright side to this, because the Board reports that the efficiency is expected to be even higher than originally estimated for this station. As I recall it, both Cockenzie and Longannet were based on what can be described as a technological breakthrough which had occurred just before they were sanctioned and which enabled them to use a low grade coal and generate electricity economically.<br><br></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the hon. Member for Midlothian (Mr. Eadie) had to vote in another Committee when we discussed this towards the end of our meeting two weeks ago. It was no fault of the hon. Gentleman's that he had to depart when I was talking about Cockenzie and Longannet. I then pointed out that four and a half years before that, I and my right hon. Friend the then Secretary of State for Scotland said that Cockenzie would provide work for about 5,000 miners and Longannet for about 10,000 miners. Even I did not foresee, when I was saying that, to what an extent that would be helpful now, because I did not know that pits would be closing and the mining industry running down at its present rate. It is of course very helpful that these two stations should be coming into commission at a time when the coal industry is in the situation of having pits closed at a higher rate than probably anyone in the Committee expected.</p>
<p>12 noon.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alex Eadie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In referring to a technological breakthrough is the hon. Member aware of a new type of boiler which is being perfected which will constitute a breakthrough in the firing of electricity power stations by coal?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister of State takes note of it. This underlines the fact that when power developments take place, whether in the discovery of North Sea gas or some new method of firing generating stations, these advances occur in such a way and so unpredictably that Ministers and the Government have continually to have the latest and most efficient assessments before them when making decisions. I hope that the Minister will be able to tell us the latest position about Cockenzie and Longannet.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
There is a notional slice of expenditure on Hunterston B, directly related to the new Invergordon smelter, which is excluded in the borrowing powers given by this Bill. This raises the question of what proportion of Hunterston B will be included, because the capital cost of that notional proportion is to be paid for under an agreement between the British Aluminium Company and, curiously enough, the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board acting on behalf of both the Boards. I dealt with this in the House when the aluminium smelter project was being debated.<br><br>
I must question the Minister about the latest issue, in November, 1968, of the publication, <i>Scottish Economic Development Quarterly Report.</i> In a section headed "Smelter skelter"—a journalistic way of describing it—there is the astonishing statement:
<br><blockquote><p>"Producing 100,000 tons of metal a year, it will increase at least thirty-fold the company's existing capacity in the Highlands at Fort William and Kinlochleven."</p></blockquote>
If that were so, it would have a tremendous effect on the situation, but I believe the present production of aluminium by the two establishments in the Highlands is about 35,000 tons a year and that an extra nought has come into the calculation. But "thirty" is written in letters and not in figures. It must be a bad inaccuracy. It should be "threefold", I believe, unless the Minister is able to explain this later. I hope that the Minister will look into this, and that, if there has been a mistake, there will be a correction in the next quarterly report. It is worth while looking through the whole of the article because there may be other parts of it which are misleading. I go on the basis that it will be threefold and not thirtyfold because with thirtyfold there would be considerably more electricity needed from the grid, or notion-ally from Hunterston B, than we have thought.<br><br>
It is clear that there was a considerable amount of storm damage to the transmission system and perhaps to other parts of the Board's equipment. Can the Minister give us an estimate in money terms of the amount of damage suffered as a result of storm?<br><br>
These are general points to which I hope the Minister will reply, but there
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1356">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 29</span>
are some more specialised points which it may be convenient to deal with later.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have a few points to put to the Minister. They are mainly Committee points, but before I come to them I wish to refer to a broader problem, and that is the question of the difficulties of estimating, about which a certain amount has quite rightly been said already.<br><br>
Because there has to be a time lag of five to seven years between the start of planning a new project and its completion, necessarily there must be involved a great deal of inspired guess work. For example, today we must be planning for a period which we hope may see a Conservative Government in office and greater expansion going on in the economy and, therefore, a greater requirement of power. It is remarkable, and very creditable to the Boards, that estimating up to the present has been so very near the mark. This gives a certain amount of confidence in their ability to look ahead, but I have one question to ask. It has been rightly said that consumption is a reflection of national prosperity. How is it, then, that although now there are 35,000 fewer persons employed in Scotland than there were in 1964, consumption of electricity has been steadily rising at a fairly considerable rate?<br><br>
I am also mystified, why the planned capacity for the South Board in 1975 is to be smaller than that in 1974. This information was given in reply to a Question some days after the debate at Second Reading, on 22nd November. Admittedly, there is a fairly small decline in planned capacity, but, nevertheless, it is there. There is a fairly considerable increase in the capacity of the North Board, which no doubt compensates for most of this, but nevertheless I am rather surprised that there should be a planned decrease rather than an increase.<br><br>
To come to some of my other points, much has been said about alternative fuels, and natural gas has been mentioned. I am a little worried that we tend to think of natural gas simply in terms of North Sea gas, whereas this might not be coming out of the pipeline for some years. Considerable use is being made of liquid gas being brought to this country by ship. For example,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
the Scottish Gas Board used some 2,000 to 3,000 tons in Granton Gas Works last year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eadie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the noble Lord aware that some of this liquid gas imported to this country, because of long-term contracts arrived at by his Government, is very much more expensive than existing indigenous fuels?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not get so far as relative costs, but obviously that is an important matter. Quite how the Scottish Gas Board is able to get this, I am not certain, but undoubtedly the Electricity Boards will be examining the cost factor in importing natural gas. If it is possible for one industry to do so it may be possible for the Electricity Boards to do so also.<br><br>
I wonder whether we could have an answer about the likelihood of liquefied gas being mixed with other forms of fuel in existing power stations and whether large sums of capital would be involved in conversion.<br><br>
On the question of cohesion between the Electricity Boards and the Atomic Energy Authority, I wonder what thinking is going on in the Government about a possible marriage or merger between them at some date during the period we are considering. That could have a significant effect on the amount of money being estimated. Perhaps the Minister can give us some idea of Government thinking on this and of arguments for or against bringing these two bodies more closely together.<br><br>
It always seems to me slightly anomalous that we should have two nationalised bodies doing the same thing but working under different Ministries. It may well be that there should be a merger between the two. The situation has changed in the last few years. When we started the Atomic Energy Authority everything was very much in an experimental stage, but now that the power stations have become established and are going concerns there may be a case for the Boards taking them over.<br><br>
I turn to some of the imponderables in estimating. I hope that the Minister may be able to answer some of my questions. Climatic changes can have a considerable effect, I dare say, on the North of Scotland Board. We had Sahara-like conditions in the north of Scotland this year.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1357">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 31</span>
We would like to know what effect a drop in rainfall will have on the costs of the North Board this year because that could affect the calculations we are making.<br><br>
I turn to the question of replacement of obsolete switchgear and other equipment. Is this having to go ahead faster than expected because switchgear is wearing out faster than was expected? Is this something which we shall have to calculate in future?<br><br>
There is the question of new transmission methods. My hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) very rightly drew attention to amenity aspects. As tourism becomes a more important industry of Scotland this is something which deserves considerable attention, particularly in relation to putting cables underground.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear. I shall come to that later on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It occurs to me that as the Government are closing railway lines here and there—I have in mind particularly the Waverley Line, on which I hope they may have second thoughts at the eleventh hour—I wonder whether disused railway tracks could be used for underground electricity transmission cables. This might be cheaper and far less unsightly than erecting new transmission poles.<br><br>
12.15 p.m.<br><br>
Talking of the Waverley line turns my attention to Border development, referred to in "Scottish Electricity Plans for the Future". This will depend a great deal upon Government decision. How much allowance has been made in the estimates for increasing capacity to the Borders? Everyone agrees on the need for great expansion of industrial development in the Borders, especially to produce new jobs and diversification. There could well be a sizeable increase in electricity consumption there over the next five or ten years.<br><br>
I have mentioned disused railway lines. There is also the question of existing lines and modernisation. There has been an electrification programme, and I assume it has been taken into account in the present estimates. However, there has been much talk about gas turbine
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
propulsion. Is it possible that a switch from electrification to gas turbines would mean a considerable change in electricity consumption?<br><br>
There are other policies which may affect electricity consumption. One is smokeless zones. If there is to be a faster extension of smokeless zone areas in big cities it may well mean a large number of households going over to electricity. Has this been allowed for?<br><br>
Foyers has been referred to, and I presume that it has been budgeted for in the estimates, even although it will still have to have the approval of the Secretary of State before it goes ahead. If the right hon. Gentleman disapproved, would this mean that a fairly large sum of money allocated to Foyers would become surplus, or is it merely a question of switching that money, or a similar sum, into an alternative scheme, perhaps somewhere else?<br><br>
In considering development district grants I am not sure that there is not a good case for allowing the Electricity Boards to apply for and to get the same development district grants which other industries are given. According to the Report of the South of Scotland Board, this could make a difference to it of about £15 million a year. This is something the Scottish Office might well press for. We must not say all this too loudly south of the Border, of course, but it could be another way for the Scottish Office to get more cash from the Treasury to spend in Scotland in enhancing its industrial prospects.<br><br>
I have made many points, some of them rather small, but they are relevant to the review of expenditure which is to take place, and I look forward to the hon. Gentleman's reply.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North (Earl of Dalkeith), and I know that he will not expect me to reply on every point now. The last point mentioned by the hon. Gentleman is interesting and I shall draw the attention of my right hon. Friend to it. It is certainly a patriotic one, and I agree that we should not speak of it too loudly in case someone is listening. I shall examine the suggestion very seriously.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman was right about Foyers. My right hon. Friend is not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1358">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 33</span>
in a position now to say yea or nay to the scheme. It must go through its proper Statutory procedures. If it were approved by my right hon. Friend it would add in 1974 to the new capacity in the North Board area. If it were not approved by him, I suggest, on present knowledge, that we would have to redeploy the investment. There are a number of possibilities but I would not like to go further on this subject today.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman's question about technological change buttresses the need for the Clause to be flexible, and for none of the money to be prescribed exclusively for one function. There must be flexibility to ensure that the best possible technological knowledge is correctly assessed.<br><br>
I come now to the question of the decline of capacity of the South Board in 1971–75, due to the withdrawal of old capacity. It is part of good business that, when a time comes when one has a margin of capacity over expected demand, one should withdraw old capacity which is a burden on the efficiency of the industry, although it has done good service in the past.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman in a position to say which power stations are likely to be faded out in this period?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Off the cuff, I cannot give that information, but if the hon. Gentleman puts down a Question I will do my best to answer it, although it may not be easy at present to say precisely which power stations will be taken out. But it is sensible to prepare to withdraw old capacity. I think that there is no argument between us on that.<br><br>
With regard to the consumption of electricity, the Board naturally take account of the development plans of the Government and try to assess them as best they can. One realises that the Border development is 18 months behind schedule. It was the Government's intention that the Tweedbank development should, given all the circumstances and statutory procedures, have been confirmed 18 months ago. It would not be proper to go into all that now, but it has been through no wish of the Government that industrial development of the Borders has been held up. The Boards know our other plans and will want to make adjust-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 34</span>
ments as they see the mdustrial pattern of the future emerging.<br><br>
The same goes for the Tayside study, which is, perhaps, the biggest possible enlargement of population in Scotland in the next 20 years and is very important—assuming, that is, that it is confirmed. When the plan is produced at the end of next year it will be seen to be on all fours with the studies for Severnside and Humberside. However, I do not want to be drawn too deeply into that this morning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that the Tayside study would produce the largest expansion of population in Scotland. I think he will accept that no study can produce any expansion of population.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is true. I was replying in the context of the question. I was asked whether the estimates had regard to the proven and adopted plans and actions of the Government in relation to the Borders and other development, and the answer is "Yes".<br><br>
In the Borders case, we have a plan which has been adopted in the short term. Almost everyone has agreed on what we should do, and we are trying to do it, and it involves the consumption of electricity. It is true that the long-term aspects of the plan have not been agreed by everyone so far. That remains in the future.<br><br>
The Electricity Boards naturally look at various proposals coming forward and if, as a consequence of next year's publication of the Tayside plan and consequent debates, it is shown that there will be a substantial aggregation of population on Tayside over the next 10 or 20 years we would expect the Electricity Boards to take this into account. It would come within at least part of the period under consideration, although, of course, it would probably be more fully embraced by a Bill. I hope the hon. Gentleman will feel that I have answered him adequately, although I regret that my precise expression earlier was not quite accurate.<br><br>
I cannot give the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Gordon Campbell) a precise answer about storm damage. As in other cases, it is difficult to separate gale repairs from maintenance and improvements because the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1359">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 35</span>
Boards, like others, have not merely restored the <i>status quo</i> but have taken the opportunity to carry out improvements which would have had to take place anyway at some time in the future. I cannot give a figure, but if the hon. Gentleman will put down a Question I will try to answer it. However, it would be difficult to arrive at a division between storm damage as such and the rest.<br><br>
On the question of fish conservation in relation to the North of Scotland Board, I tried hard to get the figures in terms of cost per annum but they vary extensively from year to year and depend largely on what activities the Board has undertaken in the year concerned. But the figures are substantial. The Board has acquired, during construction programmes, ownership of particular fisheries, and on such occasions its expenditure in that year will have been higher than normal. Returns are achieved through renting out such fisheries, and I have here a list of some examples of expenditure, and income from rentals, although I will not go right through it. The list in any case is not comprehensive, so again this is a matter which might be better dealt with by Question and Answer in the House.<br><br>
The Board's activity in fish planting is not just a service performed in terms of cash return. Where a landlord benefits from such activities it is because the number of fish in his waters has been reduced during construction and so the planting by the Board is, in a way, an act of compensation. I cannot give the figures of compensation as a whole, but again, perhaps a Parliamentary Question would enable me to give precise figures. However, I take the point that the North of Scotland Board and the South Board in its own way do a great deal not only to be fair in compensating those affected but also to enhance the general appeal of Scotland in fishing and other pursuits.<br><br>
12.30 p.m.<br><br>
I come now to the question of underground cables. This is an interesting matter, and I must admit that the figures somewhat surprised me. So much has been done in this regard. Section 9 of the Hydro-Electric Development (Scotland) Act, 1943, requires the Secretary of State to appoint an Amenity Committee,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 36</span>
and the Scottish Electricity Boards are advised accordingly on all aspects of amenity. All major proposals made by the Boards, including those for generating stations and overhead transmission lines, are examined by the Committee, which makes observations direct to the Boards. In many cases, it specifically recommends the undergrounding of cables. In addition, all overhead lines must have the approval of the local planning. authority. During 1967–68, a total of 695 circuit miles of overhead cables and 810 circuit miles of underground cables were commissioned in Scotland. In other words, the balance is the right way. At 31st March, 1968, a total of 35,122 circuit miles' of overhead cables and 26,500 circuit miles of underground cables were in commission in Scotland. I thought that figure rather surprising. I had not realised that we had so many cables underground.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may be difficult off the cuff, but can the Minister tell us where the underground cables are? Are they all in the cities? Our principal interest is in making sure that we have them in the countryside.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give that off the cuff. I accept that a part is in built-up areas, but a proportion, and particularly in the North Board's area, has been deliberately laid underground for reasons of amenity. For example, within the figure for 1967–68 which I gave, the North Board laid 30 miles of underground cable purely for amenity reasons.<br><br>
The main barrier to extensive under-grounding of cables is the cost. We are trying by research to pursue different ways to reduce such costs. I have a table here showing the comparative costs per mile of overhead and underground cable, but it would be unfair to read it to the committee since it is rather involved. I suggest that it might be a good subject—it is strange for a Minister to say this—for a Written Answer. I should be happy to provide the information.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister look into the possibility of using disused railway lines rather more for transmission cables, and also the laying of electricity cables in conjunction with gas or oil supply pipes?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1360">Image</span>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They might be blown up by the Scottish Nationalists.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have not been plagued by that disease yet in Scotland. It has not reached us from Wales, and I hope that it never does.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lawson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not ask for the details now, but could my hon. Friend give us the average cost of overhead as compared with the average cost of underground cable?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should not like to try to do that quickly in my head because there are eight columns of figures here. Having studied under my hon. Friend on several occasions, I know how good he is at that sort of thing, and I do not want to make guesses. I think that it would be better to pursue the matter by Written Answer. The Committee will notice that I do not say Oral Answer.<br><br>
Several suggestions worthy of examination have been made, and I shall bring them to the attention of the Boards, including the suggestion about the use of disused railway lines.<br><br>
I did not follow the point which the noble Lord the Member for Edinburgh, North made regarding amalgamation with the Atomic Energy Authority. Does he mean among the three or between the Atomic Energy Authority and the North Board, or the South Board?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I meant among the three. I thought that atomic energy stations in the South Board's area might be merged with the South Board and those in the north with the North Board.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Within the context of this Bill we are not as a Government contemplating the merging of any part of the Atomic Energy Authority with the two Electricity Boards.<br><br>
We had a debate about the two Boards and an examination of this question as a consequence of the Mackenzie Committee's Report, and both Government and Opposition decided against amalgamating the North and South Boards. Since 1964 we have brought the Boards closer together—in the joint generating account, in the way that their Chairmen are members of each other's Boards, and in the way they can exchange power without the former complications. I think that we have got over most of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 38</span>
the functional difficulties between the Boards.<br><br>
The point has been made that, although in the early days it was sensible to have the Atomic Energy Authority separate from the two Electricity Boards as it was experimenting and developing various techniques, there might well be a fusion now that the conventional stage has been reached. One should remember, nevertheless, that the prototype fast reactor is yet another experimental stage. True, it will feed into the North Board system, but that can easily be a commercial arrangement. The very name "prototype fast reactor" shows that it is experimental. The Atomic Energy Authority has a lot of experimental work to do. I should not like to be definite on what will happen in the future because I do not know, but within the context of the Bill the Government have no plan for a merger between any of the three nationalised undertakings we are discussing.<br><br>
I was asked why, if male employment has fallen by the amount it has, consumption has increased. The answer is that electricity consumption is not directly related to the number of workers employed. Indeed, in a modern industrialised economy it is often an inverse proportion, parallel, in a sense, to the concept of a capital-intensive industry. I shall look into the article which the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn drew to my attention, but the amount of electricity to be consumed at the smelter bears no relation to the number of workers actually employed. That is the best example I can give. Once we have a certain number of workers employed, it does not follow that there will be anything like the figure of consumption which we have taken as the average hitherto.<br><br>
We have made provision for the smelter when fully commissioned to take about one-fifth of what Hunterston B produces, that is, about 250 megawatts. Perhaps I might now mention the arrangements which I had it in mind to detail at our last Sitting. The Aluminium Company will pay a capital contribution in respect of the capital cost of the appropriate tranche of generating capacity at Hunters-ton B along with the relevant transmission expenditure. It will also make an annual payment based on the operating
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1361">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 39</span>
cost of Hunterston B and other costs, including the cost of supplies from the grid till Hunterston B is available. Details of the contract are confidential to the Board and the Company, but I give the assurance again that the contractual arrangements have been carefully designed to ensure that the smelter will bear the full cost of the power which it requires and that no burden will fall on other consumers.<br><br>
Now, Cockenzie. I agree that the troubles here have been a disappointment, but they can be overcome. During a routine inspection in August hairline cracks were discovered in the welding of pipes associated with the boilers of the three generating sets. The sets were immediately taken out of service for investigation and repair. The contractor, on whom prime responsibility falls for putting these things right, has looked into the matter, and it is hoped that one of the units will be back in operation by the end of this year. The fourth and final set is to be commissioned this month—that is, December—and it will gradually build up to full power. Despite the regrettable loss of capacity, which is no one's fault, the Scottish Board does not expect any disruption of supplies this winter. There is already spare generating capacity in England and Wales sufficient to offset any deficit which we might have in Scotland, and the transmission links are adequate to carry the current likely to be required.<br><br>
I do not recall any specific point which I have missed in the debate on this Question. I am grateful to the Committee for the reception which it has given to the Clause thus far.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's reply has been helpful in one or two respects concerning amenity, but I have certain questions to raise.<br><br>
After our debate at Second reading, I thought that the Minister would now be able to give us the breakdown of costs to industrial consumers, which he said he would ascertain, and that he might also give an indication of the policy of the Boards on the question whether they propose to reduce the cost gap between industrial and domestic consumers or whether the gap will be kept roughly at
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 40</span>
the same differential. This is a matter of interest to Scotland as a whole.<br><br>
The Minister rightly reminded us that there is an Amenity Committee for both Boards, but I am only sorry that Scotland is not taken more into their confidence. In a way, this is a public relations operation, yet the South Board tells us nothing in its Report about what it is doing or has done, whether there has been resistance to pylons here and there, or what steps it is taking in a constructive way to improve or maintain amenities in the establishment of transmission lines for the future. I hope that the Boards will note that this matter has been raised more than once in our debate and will be more forthcoming about future progress.<br><br>
I was interested in the suggestion made by my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North (Earl of Dalkeith) about the use of railway lines for underground cables. My jocular remark about attendant dangers was purely light-hearted, and I regard his suggestion as a valuable one worthy of careful study. I shall take up the Minister's invitation to put down Questions for Written Answer about underground transmission lines, since this matter interests me greatly and I want to know where they are.<br><br>
On page 29 of the South Board's Report there is a picture of a super-grid transmission pylon. This is the sort of thing which fills one with apprehension. It is presently for 275 kilowatts and could take 400 kilowatts. Bearing in mind the switching stations on the super-grids, I want to know whether we shall have a super-grid from Hunterston to Invergordon or whether the present line is capable of taking the increased consumption. The thought of a super-grid all the way from Ayrshire, through Argyllshire, through the Great Glen and over the top to Cromarty Firth fills one with apprehension. One hopes that the Amenity Committee is looking into that sort of question.<br><br>
Again, on page 37 of the Report there is an attractive photograph of a model of Hunterston showing both A and B. I give full praise to the Board for the great trouble it took in the design of the station from the point of view of aspect from the Firth of Clyde and from inland, but I notice that the photograph shows only two transmission lines leaving Hunterston and I suspect that in not

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 41</span>
many years there will be more than two. It is this sort of thing which gives concern, since it is the transmission lines more than the stations themselves which cause so much unsightliness in Scotland. I hope that we shall not have repeated at Hunterston B what happened at Dungeness, where planning permission was given for the power station and then, subsequently, in little blocks, the super-grid was built across the south of England almost without regard to the beauty of the countryside, which was thereby destroyed.<br><br>
12.45 p.m.<br><br>
I wish to press the Minister about the electrification of the Glasgow-Carlisle railway line. Is money allowed under this Bill for the electrification of this line? It will need switching stations in Dumfriesshire and Elvanfoot and super-grid transmission lines. This will be very expensive. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North, I hope that we shall have the turbine train which will, perhaps, be much quicker and cheaper from the capital point of view in the long run and remove the necessity to electrify the line from Crewe to Glasgow. I should like to know whether the costs have been included, bearing in mind that the Minister of Transport has said that no decision will be made for at least a year.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will answer these points. I shall put down Written Questions on the more detailed matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister of State has not mentioned one of the points which I raised two weeks ago. It arose from what he said at the end of the debate two years ago, concerning the financial position of the two Boards, and was connected with the "freeze". We should be glad to have up-to-date information on this. The hon. Gentleman said in the House:
<br><blockquote><p>"Until they can increase their income, the financial position of the two boards must remain a matter of concern"—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 2nd November, 1966; Vol. 735, c. 613.]</p></blockquote>
Quite a lot has happened in the two years since then. I hope that the Minister will tell us his feelings now in this respect.<br><br>
I have given the Minister notice of my second point. It concerns the Boards' part in controlling flooding. Perhaps the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 42</span>
best illustration is the serious flooding which took place in Inverness-shire and Ross-shire nearly two years ago. The water went right over the top of one dam, which I saw myself, and there were uprooted trees on top of the dam. I do not say that this was the fault of anybody connected with the Board concerned, but, after the flooding had been considered, one of the recommendations which I made to the Secretary of State—and I have a copy of my letter to him—was that it had been suggested
<br><blockquote><p>"that all the authorities and services concerned, including the Hydro Board, should come together in order to work out flood control measures, an early warning system and emergency action so that they are all better prepared to avert or deal with future emergencies."</p></blockquote>
That was said in a letter which dealt mainly with the need for 100 per cent. Government financial assistance for mending breaches in the river banks which, I am glad to say, the Secretary of State acceded to later. In his letter to me of 13 th January, 1967, on the other point which was less urgent and more long-term, the Secretary of State said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I should like to consider further how a flood warning system could best be organised",</p></blockquote>
I hope that, since this is the next opportunity which we have had of discussing these matters, the Minister of State will tell us what progress has been made.<br><br>
There are three aspects. The first is the way in which the Board may be able to assist. I grant that nobody can foresee exactly what the weather will do. The meteorological experts confess that they make mistakes. However, if those involved have the latest meteorological reports they will be in a better position to control the level above the dam and the flow of water and thus make the floods less damaging or even manage to avert them, especially if their is a combination of a lot of snow melting and heavy rain, which caused the damaging and distressing floods in that area nearly two years ago.<br><br>
Secondly, there is the question of giving warning. If there is the prospect of dangerous flooding in the near future it may be that the Board will be in a position before anybody else to give a warning to the local community and those concerned with the banks of the rivers and farther down.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1363">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 43</span>
The third point concerns relations with the local population. If there is confidence that the Board can help in these ways, and if there is close contact between the Boards' representatives and the representatives of the local community, there is a feeling that the Board can assist by having, first, some measure of intervention and, secondly, the opportunity of warning people in the area if, unfortunately, there is a danger of flooding. I mention that because the floods to which I referred as an example did not, fortunately, occur at night. If they had occurred at night, there would have been danger to life, because houses were badly flooded. If the flooding had occurred at night, the situation would have been much more serious.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister of State will be able to tell us what progress has been made in these respects.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr, Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) about the importance of the Amenity Committee. It is difficulty for the Committee to toot its own trumpet. However, its trumpet wil not be tooted for it. It is difficult for the Committee, because proposals are shown to it at a very early stage by the Boards. Many of the objections which it makes and modifications which are agreed to by the Boards do not come to the notice of the public. This means that it would have to write a commentary saying, "If it were not for us, the following would have taken place", which puts the Boards' proposals in a somewhat different light. I take the point that perhaps the Committee could do more to publicise the more positive amenity activities of the Boards irrespective of the difficulty which I have raised about underground cables and the formation of dams. I will draw this matter to the attention of our good friends Mr. Tom Fraser and Mr. Lewis Allan and suggest that they should have a word with the Amenity Committee to see whether it will be willing to say a bit more in the annual reports about what it is doing.<br><br>
I am told that the present transmission lines at Hunterston are capable of up-rating to carry the full output of the A and B stations.<br><br>
An assessment of the additional power needed for the Carlisle-Glasgow railway
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 44</span>
has been included in the estimates. It is not, therefore, a reason for preventing electrification. Whatever other reasons may be advanced—and I hope that there will not be many—that cannot be one.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Gordon Campbell) was kind enough to speak to me about the question of flooding last night. I have been making some inquiries, and particularly about a flood warning system. I am told that there have been many discussions about this matter. I am not sure about the up-to-date position, although my officials have made inquiries. I shall write to the hon. Gentleman, but if he does not feel that that is fair to other interested hon. Members, I will try to refer to it on Third Reading. That is the best that I can suggest. This is a very complicated matter. The hon. Gentleman has taken a very reasonable and fair view of it.<br><br>
The suggestion has been made, although the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn did not make it this morning, that the Hydro works cause flooding. This is a very complex engineering problem. It is never easy, even for the experts—and not just the meteorological experts but our engineering experts—to say to what extent interference with natural watercourses has indirect consequences. I understand that, in the case of the Conon flooding, the Board took the view that its operations led to a reduction of the flooding. However, this is a matter for further comment later. I hope that it will be in order on Third Reading to mention it. It will involve some expenditure under the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister of State will deal with the financial position of the Boards.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows the position. The Government have issued a White Paper on this which, to some extent, buttresses the previous White Paper. We have readily admitted that the steps taken by the Prices and Incomes Board have distorted the financial problems of the Boards. Therefore, we do not allow any blame to fall on them. It is entirely Government policy which has done this, and we make no excuses about it. We are discussing the targets intimately with the Board, and a statement will be made in the near future. This is not something on which I can
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1364">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 45</span>
comment today. It does not impede the passage of Clause 1 or even of the Bill. If I have any more information to retail, I will be happy to give it during later stages of the Bill. I can say nothing about the financial targets now. I readily agree that the targets dictate, to some extent, the tariffs and proposals of the Boards. I realise their importance. The fact that I do not comment on them today does not mean that I underrate them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would seem to be for the convenience of the Committee to continue the proceedings to 1.15. That does not mean that there will not be a Sitting on Thursday, but we can see how we get on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to delay the Committee for more than a moment. However, since I have it in mind to oppose the Motion, That the Clause stand part of the Bill, I should explain why I intend to do so. My</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Dr, Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Miss Harvie Anderson, I want to thank you for presiding over us. We are very sorry that you were a little late this morning.

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 46</span>
<p>reason is very simple. While I have substantial reservations about the wisdom of providing for an increase in the borrowing powers of the Boards to the interim limit at a time such as this, I would have been prepared to accept it, but the Minister was not prepared to come any way towards meeting the point of my first Amendment. I do not believe that this is the moment when we should provide for an activation of the printing press to the tune of an additional £250 million. For that reason, I could not agree to the Clause as it stands.</p>
<p><i>And it being One o'clock,</i> The CHAIRMAN, <i>pursuant to Standing Order No. 66</i> (<i>Meetings of Standing Committees</i>), <i>deferred adjourning the Committee.</i></p>

<p>myself with what the Minister of State has just said. We realise that the foggy conditions made it very difficult for you to get here. We were delighted to see you when you arrived. We thank you very much for presiding over us.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to extend my apologies to the Committee, and to thank hon. Members very warmly for their indulgence. The motive power was not at its best this morning, in this not always perfect world.</span></p>
