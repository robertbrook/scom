	<section>
	<div class='title'>POWER OF SECRETARY OF STATE TO PRESCRIBE STANDARDS FOR, AND TO APPROVE, PREMISES, ETC., OF EDUCATIONAL ESTABLISHMENTS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed</i> [	<i>25th February</i>], That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we adjourned on Tuesday I was discussing the machinery for the enforcement of subsection (2)(	<i>b</i>)(ii):
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Secretary of State may give his approval unconditionally, or subject to such conditions as he may think fit."</p></blockquote>
My question is a very simple one. I want to know how the machinery will work whereby the conditions are imposed, because I really have doubts about its effectiveness. I make no apology of returning to the subject of playing fields, by way of illustration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I asked the Secretary of State what advice he had given to local authorities about the provision of school playing fields, and he replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The authorities have been recommended to include in building contracts generally a reasonable damages clause providing for the reimbursement of identifiable losses if delay occurs."</p></blockquote>
It is really the same point as my hon. Friend the Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. Michael Foot) raised yesterday in a rather different context; and that is the whole problem of pushing stuff through the Committees of the House of Commons without it being revealed, in his words, precisely what we are trying to do. It seems to me that that is a very legitimate form of inquiry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think we should leave this Clause without making some further reference to the com-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>380</span>
ments of the Minister at our last Sitting. The hon. Gentleman was referring, not for the first time, to the 1967 Regulations, and he appeared to be scolding his hon. Friend the Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) for not having raised any objection to the 1967 Regulations when they were first introduced. I think it is right that the Committee and the Minister should be reminded that these Regulations were made and laid and became effective during a Summer Recess when hon. Members were not here. They were made on 3rd August, 1967, they were laid on 16th August, and they became effective two days later, on 18th August. The House rose for the Summer Recess on 28th July of that year and did not reassemble until 23rd October.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that there is nothing improper in regulations being made and laid and becoming effective while the House is in Recess, but it is a little unkind that eighteen months thereafter the Minister should appear to chide his hon. Friend for not attending more closely to the Regulations when they appeared. The Minister's comment was not entirely fair, and would have been fairer if he had pointed out that his hon. Friend would possibly have been in some difficulty during the Recess in discovering the Regulations and taking action on them. I do not want to make too much of this point but I think it is right to make it. Having said that, I should like to have an assurance from the hon. Gentleman that, so far as possible, regulations of this kind will not in future be made and laid during long Recesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate on this Clause has shown the great interest which hon. Members on both sides have in building standards. It has shown our concern that the Regulations governing, in particular, the older school buildings should provide for their quality to be improved, and we now have the playing field point which has exercised the minds of several hon. Members, particularly the hon. Member for West Lothian. I hope the hon. Gentleman will be able to give us an assurance that, when regulations of this importance are to be made, every effort will be undertaken by his Department to lay them while Members are present at Westminster.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to the fact that in 1967 the

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>381</span>
Regulations then presented were more or less accepted by the House without any debate or comment. I agree that these things happen, but a valid point has been raised. During the debate on Tuesday the Minister, dealing with another aspect of this matter, gave us the feeling that the local authorities had power which in some way they did not always utilise. I gather from the Minister's reply that in their actions the local authorities were not so subservient to the Department as many people seemed to think. When one reads the speech which the Minister made it seems that the regulations will be very powerful indeed, and I wonder whether we may be able to amend them if necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Bruce Millan)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I could start by saying something which I neglected to say at half-past ten on a point of order. I should like to give notice to the Committee now, in an informal way, that next Tuesday I shall be moving a Sittings Motion, that we meet on Wednesday afternoons as well as on Tuesday and Thursday mornings. I am simply giving notice of that now so that hon. Gentlemen will know in advance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the wish of all of us to make progress with the Bill, and we can argue on Tuesday—I hope, not at length—whether or not it is necessary to sit for an extra afternoon. However, I should be grateful if, before committing himself to the Wednesday afternoons, the hon. Gentleman would take advice and find out what the business is likely to be on Wednesday afternoons, particularly of next week. There is a major constitutional Bill before the House now, which has already occupied us considerably downstairs, and it would be unfortunate if we were to clash with that yet again. I do not think we shall raise any serious objections to any reasonable Sittings Motion, but it would be for the convenience of hon. Members if the hon. Gentleman would check this morning to see that the extra Sitting here will not clash with important and critical business on the Floor of the House.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Esmond Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I just point out to the Minister that there is a suggestion that the first meeting of the new Select Committee on Scottish affairs is next Wednesday afternoon, so will he bear that in mind?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall take all these factors into account. I was simply giving warning so that Members of the Committee would be aware that there would be a Sittings Motion, and so they could think things over and could put their points to me, but if they wish to put any more points to me, I hope they will do so outside the Committee. We have already given notice through the usual channels, and it would be wrong to debate this point when we are discussing Clause 4.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>383</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will surely agree that I am the most brief of people, and I am only asking the Minister about timing. Will the Motion next Tuesday refer to having a Sitting on the day following, on the Wednesday? If so, it does not give us very much time to make arrangements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I doubt whether that is a point of order. Surely the purpose of my giving notice today is so that I cannot be accused next Tuesday of introducing a Sittings Motion which gives unreasonable notice to Members. I do not think I was under any obligation to make that little statement, but I did it because I wanted to help the Committee. If there are points about next week, I am certainly willing to listen to them between now and next Tuesday, as well as to anything that may be said next Tuesday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to Clause 4, and to the points that have been made about the regultions which may be produced under it, I am not now able to say what the regulations will contain and when they will be introduced. It would be unreasonable to ask me to do that. As regards timing, the fact that regulations may come into operation during a period of Parliamentary Recess makes absolutely no difference in Parliamentary terms, because the 40 days for objection are 40 Sitting days of the House. The incidence of Parliamentary Recesses is not, therefore, relevant, at least from the point of view of Parliamentary debate. As regards the amendment of the Act, these regulations, like other similar Regulations under the Education Act, are subject to the negative procedure and cannot be amended; but that is not peculiar to these regulations; it applies to virtually all Regulations which the Government introduce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only other point was the question of how the regulations made under this Clause are to be made effective. I have already said that the implementation of many of the points included in the present Regulations, and which are likely to be included in any subsequent regulations, is the responsibility of the local education authorities. But it is not true that the Government wash their hands, as it were, of the whole process, because the present system, for example, involves approval in principle of any project, it involves approval of the site, of the sketch plans and of the estimate costs; and in the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>384</span>
case of tenders which are in excess of the approved estimated costs it involves the approval of tenders as well. The Department is, therefore, involved at various stages of a project, and there is, of course, an administrative procedure of very considerable detail laid down to help authorities, in their relationships with the Department, to see what precisely is expected of them and where the responsibility for any part of the procedure lies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once a project has been approved and work started, supervision of the work and responsibility for seeing that it is satisfactorily, economically and efficiently completed is that of the local education authority. I am not aware that any local authority wishes the responsibility to be other than where it is at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='clause'>Clause 5</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>DISCONTINUANCE OF EDUCATIONAL ESTABLISHMENTS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the convenience of the Committee we will take with Amendment No. 20 Amendments 21, 22, 23 and 24.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 20, in page 5, line 23, leave out from 'management' to 'is' in line 25 and insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'or to discontinue the use, in connection with such an educational establishment, of any part of that establishment, or of any building or part of a building ancillary to the establishment, and land forming the site, or part of the site, of that establishment or of that part of the establishment or of that building or part of a building, as the case may be'.</p></blockquote>
The Clause is intended to simplify the procedure under which the Secretary of State may free school sites from the restrictions of the School Sites Act, 1841, or from similar conditions. The Clause as drafted deals with the discontinuance of educational establishments as a whole and land forming the site of such an establishment, but it is necessary also to deal with cases where only part of an establishment or part of a building is discontinued, so that only part of the site is involved. An authority might wish to discontinue and dispose of part of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0660">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>385</span>
school—the outbuildings, the school house or some other part of the school—which happened to be subject to the restrictions in the School Sites Act, 1841. I do not imagine that there will be many cases of that sort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 20 to 24 will enable these cases to be dealt with in exactly the same way as if we were dealing with the complete site of an establishment. These are basically technical Amendments in a technical Clause, and I hope that they will be acceptable to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister gave the impression that the School Sites Act, 1841, related only to matters which are dealt with by this Clause, but Section 22 of the principal Act refers not only to this matter but to transfers under Section 18 of the 1918 Act, Section 16 of the 1946 Act, and also Section 16 of the 1962 Act. Could the Minister say whether this procedure for transferring part of a building or part of a site applies not only under the relevant Section of the 1841 Act, but also to transfers under Section 16 of the 1962 Act?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend said there would not be many cases, so one wonders what demand there is for the Clause. So my first question is, how many sites are involved, and what has been the demand from the authorities in this matter?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A second question which I should like to ask was prompted by a talk which I heard given by Lord Robens on Coal Board matters. He said that the Coal Board had at pitheads a large number of superbly constructed buildings, which could be used for minor industrial purposes. Many of the old schools, built in the Victorian age, are very good structures and it is a pity that some are left to rot. I feel that there is a case for the Department to discuss the general policy in relation to good, solid buildings which are often replaced by new schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that this was a technical Clause. I am rather naive about the difficulties of drafting, and in my first six months here I put down a rather brash Question to the then Prime Minister, Mr. Macmillan, asking how the Finance Bill could be simplified. He kindly and properly took the Question seriously, and wrote a letter saying that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>386</span>
he would send me to Sir Noel Hutton, Chief Parliamentary draftsman. After an hour with Sir Noel I was a little more diffident about suggesting simplification in legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say that because I know the difficulties which are involved, but this provision strikes me as unnecessarily difficult. I do not understand the passage in subsection (1),
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Secretary of State, on the application in that behalf of the education authority, may by order direct that the said proviso or condition shall not have effect in relation to that land".</p></blockquote>
Could this not be drafted more simply?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: None of these points has anything to do with the Amendment. They could arise on the question, That the Clause stand part of the Bill. If it is agreeable to you, Mr. Jennings, that I should deal with them now I shall do so; but since nobody has said anything at all about the Amendment, I gather that it will be accepted. The Amendment elaborates the Clause in a way to enable us to deal with particular parts of a site or parts of an establishment which could not be dealt with under the Clause as drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cath-cart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) raised a point on Section 16 of the 1962 Act. That Section has nothing to do with what is proposed by this Clause of the Bill. Here we are dealing with sites subject to restrictions under the 1841 Act. By this Clause we are removing school sites from the ambit of the general provisions of Clause 119 of the 1962 Act, which made these particular sites into educational endowments and brought in the complicated endowment procedures of the 1962 Act. We are now bringing them into a separate provision so that they can be dealt with by a simplified procedure. Clause 16 of the 1962 Act does not apply, except in so far as any school which may be involved is subject to the School Sites Act, 1841.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Neither I nor the Department, without a good deal of research at local authority level, could say, how many of these sites remain in Scotland. They are likely to be sites with complicated legal histories. Where these sites exist, we are making it easier by introducing Clause 5 for local education authorities, in discontinuing schools subject to the 1841 Act, to deal with the land involved. I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0661">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>387</span>
know that this is welcome to the education authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Further Amendments made:</i> No. 21, in page 6, line 4, leave out from 'sum' to end of line 5;</p>
	<p>No. 22, in line 8, leave out third 'the' and insert 'any'.</p>
	<p>No. 23, in line 14, after 'site', insert 'or part of the site'.</p>
	<p>No. 24, in line 16, after 'an', insert 'educational'.—[	<i>Mr. Millan.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Brewis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One tends to find that when a village sohool in a country area has been closed down for two or three years the schoolhouse continues to be used, perhaps for a school teacher who is teaching in a different area. The school building gets into a bad state of repair, with windows broken, and is often most unsightly. I hope that the Scottish Education Department will look into the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to ask one question on subsection (2) which mentions Section 119(3) of the principal Act relating to certain school land to be deemed to be an educational endowment. The principal Act says endowment is for,
	<br><blockquote><p>"the education of children belonging to the poorer classes, either generally or within a particular area … such endowment … for their benefit shall continue … to be applied for the benefit of such children."</p></blockquote>
However, subsection (2) of this Clause says
	<br><blockquote><p>"Section 119(3) of the principal Act … shall cease to have effect. …"</p></blockquote>
It would thus appear that endowments for poorer children need not necessarily be applied for their benefit. I am sure that my interpretation is wrong, but I should like to hear the Minister's comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not feel that I can answer as to any particular endowment, whether or not it is subject to the restrictions of the School Sites Act, 1841.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman the Member for Galloway (Mr. Brewis) got the wrong Section. The Section from which he quoted is another provision dealing with educational endowments. But it allows me to make the general point about Clause 119(3) which brings sites with which we are dealing—which may be the sites of schools or educational establishments—into the complicated provisions on endowments in the 1962 Act. It is difficult for an education authority to deal with any land or buildings which may form a part of them. I know that the hon. Gentleman is anxious that, where schools are discontinued, premises which are available should be used for other purposes. Clause 5 will considerably reduce the difficulties which arise at present because premises are subject to the 1841 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing with particular premises; we are not dealing with old school premises as a whole. The 1841 Act was passed to encourage owners to give, sell or exchange land for sites for schools and it was provided in the Act—and this is where the current situation arises—that upon the land or any part thereof ceasing to be used for the purposes specified—that is educational purposes—the land would immediately revert to the owner. Many generous people, particularly in the nineteenth century, gave sites for schools under that condition. The Committee will realise that this can lead to quite complicated situations in some cases more than a hundred years later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Clause of the Bill creates a less complicated procedure for dealing with such sites. It does not at all remove the rights of any owners that they have under the 1841 Act. It provides, though, that if the person concerned cannot, after due inquiry be found, or if he can be found and has consented to relinquish his rights on payment of a sum of money, then the Secretary of State can direct as provided for in this Clause, and previous provisos and conditions shall not have

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>389</span>
effect. This is a fair balance between the legitimate rights of former owners and the desire of education authorities to deal flexibly and quickly with such sites.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether the grounds of the Glasgow High School or any other particular establishment in Scotland is subject to this Act I would not care to say, but if so, then the new Clause 5 will enable education authorities to deal with the land more satisfactorily than they can under the rather complicated conditions of present legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suggest that the Minister should look a little carefully at whether the lands of fee-paying schools may be affected. The Minister said that this relates to lands which are covered by the Schools Sites Act, 1841. This deals with the question of lands reverting to the grantor. In Section 119 there is reference to "condition of a similar nature" and another in subsection (3) relating to land
	<br><blockquote><p>"held under a condition of the nature referred to in subsection (1)".</p></blockquote>
So it is not quite so simple as it might appear. It is not just land and buildings covered by the School Sites Act, 1841, but also land and buildings covered by similar provisions. In those circumstances I hope the Minister will look at this rather more carefully to see the extent of its effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I found the Minister's reply convincing but it is appropriate to ask whether there should not be discussions with the local authorities at an official level on the whole question of land use and building use to which the hon. Member for Galloway (Mr. Brewis) and I referred. This is a real problem. The other day I visited Colney Hatch in north London and I realised the extent to which hospitals also had considerable land bequeathed to them by those good people in the Victorian era. This is also true of many Scottish hospitals. I would think at this conference that many of us would like to see the representatives of my hon. Friend's other responsibility, the Health Service, also brought in, so that a coherent discussion can take place on building use and land use in relation to school endowments, school lands and hospital lands, at the same time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the Clause because it appears at first sight to extend the provisions which presently exist to an extent which is new at least to me. According to the Clause,
	<br><blockquote><p>"An education authority may for the purpose of promoting education generally, or of improving the facilities for education available, … make payments … to any … person providing education or educational services."</p></blockquote>
Subsection (1, c) says,
	<br><blockquote><p>"with the approval of the Secretary of State, to the managers of any school … ".</p></blockquote>
Does the approval of the Secretary of State for the operation of paragraph (	<i>c</i>) apply to all the following paragraphs?

Assuming paragraph (	<i>e</i>) stands on its own merits and a grant of money may be made freely

I welcome that particular intent. Will the Minister explain exactly what this will do?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of us have been associated either with teaching or with creating provisions for education along lines that until recently were not usually accepted by local education authorities as being within their province in providing education, particularly adult education. This led to the formation of organisations such as the Scottish Labour College and the Workers' Education Association. These
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0663">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>391</span>
bodies, with both of which I have been associated, did their job adequately and in many cases very well, but because of the lack of physical provisions for education in the Scottish Labour College—the W.E.A. was better equipped in that respect—teaching was sometimes done under impossible conditions, where there was little internal discipline and external discipline could not be imposed. Therefore the education was never quite as successful as it should have been. As a result the Scottish Labour College, which did good work in its own way, has ceased to operate, but the Workers' Educational Association, because it gradually created a closer contact and understanding with the established functional bodies created for educational purposes has progressed and is now doing an even better job, although along lines which have been slightly modified. Nevertheless, it is welcome because it meets a need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is much to be said for this Clause, because I can envisage its covering formal education for young people and providing moneys for education which present educational provisions do not do; where, for instance, somebody with a sufficiently large house decides to create an educational institution. Such institutions appeal to certain people and have a good clientele because many people think they do fill a need. They are usually in the midst of large houses and so children can easily be taken from their homes to these small education centres which, as a rule, are fee-paying. Would these small schools and colleges, as they are sometimes called, come under the scope of this particular Clause? I am not criticising this. I want to see it applied as widely as possible, but nevertheless, we want to be absolutely clear as to the purpose of these various paragraphs. To my mind, some of them are not a matter of dispute, but I think the Minister could help us by saying a word or two on this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This Clause is in substitution of sections 25 and 26 of the principal Act. One thing has been added and one taken out, and I would like to hear the reasons for that. The part which has been taken out is that under Section 25(1) of the principal Act by which provision was made for grants to educational
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>392</span>
establishments not under a local authority's own management. There was a condition to any such grant, which was that the teachers had to be remunerated at a rate not lower than the rate for similar teachers employed by the authority. Instead of this we now have a general provision that it has to be according to an agreement made between the two parties concerned. We know that there are different rates of remuneration in private colleges for various reasons, but there are many establishments where the rates of remuneration tend to be lower, or the conditions of employment tend to be different. It seems strange that we are on the point of passing this Clause without being given a reason for these changes. The reason is not obvious from reading the Clause. The actual provision to which I am referring appears to have been removed entirely in the new Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So much for the thing which has been omitted. What about the thing that has been added? Under Clause 26 of the principal Act there is a general provision about contributions to the maintenance of any university, but under the Clause we are now substituting for it, that is widened to include also the hostel used by students attending a university. It is possibly quite sensible that these reputable organisations which provide living accommodation for students should be supported by someone, and the Minister could be given a say in the circumstances in which it would be appropriate for a contribution to be made to a hostel by a local education authority. We know that in some of our universities we have large halls of residence which are specifically confined to students, but in this provision "residence" is specifically with a small "r" and there is no definition of any sort. I would appear that if Mrs. Bloggs' boardinghouse were to provide accommodation for the students of Aberdeen University a grant could be made to Mrs. Bloggs by the education authority. This would not appear to be very sensible, but it could be done under this new Clause and some well-meaning and kindly authority might interpret it in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think we should know what we are letting our local authorities in for. I should like to know whether there is any definition of "residence", and, indeed,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0664">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>393</span>
whether, in the absence of any such definition, the Minister will take the opportunity to write to local authorities in order to say what would be an adequate definition of the word "residence". It seems to be very loose at the moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Three quick points. Subsection (1)(	<i>a</i>) refers to payments "to another education authority". I think my right hon. Friend the Member for Lanarkshire, North (Miss Herbison) will agree that the scheme we recently introduced, whereby some pupils in her constituency get their secondary education in my constituency, is working well, but there is a general problem that, as more and more of the secondary schools become bigger, and perhaps become large comprehensive schools, a good deal more flexibility should be shown in transferring pupils across counties. It seems to be working fairly well in some places, but I suspect there are other places where a good deal more flexibility could be shown. Therefore I welcome subsection (1)(	<i>a</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In regard to subsection (1)(	<i>b</i>) I should like to refer to one constituency problem. It may be within the recollection of the Minister's Department that about three years ago we had a long correspondence on the question of a grant for a junior secondary pupil at the then Lindsay High School, Bathgate, to attend the Royal Ballet School. This grant was in fact given, and I am glad to sav the pupil is doing extremely well, but it was quite a struggle to get the grant, and I would like to be fairly sure that those with unusual talents are helped by the authorities. I know one has to be somewhat selective in these matters but I hope subsection (1)(	<i>b</i>) will be liberally interpreted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to subsection (1)(	<i>f</i>), I am becoming slightly critical of the amount of educational research that is being done by various authorities without reference to people doing similar research. I think there are great dangers in centralising research, and particularly educational research. And I would not be happy about an over-centralised svstem, and my one question is, on what basis will the judgment be made by an educational authority that in fact the research is worth while, and is not being done somewhere else in Scotland or in England?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>394</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to ask a supplementary question to the three questions which have been posed by the hon. Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell). This arises out of what seems to me to be a rather curious omission in what one might call the economy Section in the 1962 Act, which lists what can be done by the Secretary of State or by local authorities:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Provided that the amount of the contribution required to be made under this subsection shall not exceed the amount by which the income of such school falls short of the expenditure."</p></blockquote>
That important Section is now deleted, and the only thing which seems to me to be in any way relevant to it appears in subsection (1),
	<br><blockquote><p>"and any such payment may be made either unconditionally or subject to such conditions as may be agreed between the parties."</p></blockquote>
The new Clause describes far more clearly than did the old Section what can be done, but I would not like this to be an open-ended commitment for any authority or the Secretary of State, and I would welcome a clarification from the Minister as to why he has deleted that provision in the original Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A number of interesting points have been raised on this Clause, which basically replaces Sections 25 and 26 of the 1962 Act, and I believe replaces them in a simpler and shorter way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far as my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) is concerned, it is not for me to interpret the words of a Statute, but I would certainly interpret subsection (1)(	<i>e</i>), which says
	<br><blockquote><p>"to any other person providing education or educational services",</p></blockquote>
as including any assistance that a local authority might want to give to an educational establishment of one sort or another. We give the powers to the educational authorities. No duties are imposed on them under this Clause. We are simply giving them fairly wide powers with the minimum of restrictions and allowing them to use money in a way which they thing will be for the benefit of education in their area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that answers a number of other points, because one has to look at the words preceding paragraphs (	<i>a</i>) to (	<i>f</i>). and an educational authority using its powers under this Clause will be doing so for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0665">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>395</span>
the purposes of promoting education generally or improving the facilities for education in general, and in its area in particular. So there has to be a real educational benefit to be obtained, either for the people living in the area of the education authority, or in a more general context, and in my view we can rely on educational authorities to use their money sensibly. These authorities are normally under considerable financial inhibitions and I do not imagine they will use this Clause as an excuse to throw their money about. I think we should be giving them less credit for ordinary common sense than we should if we imagine that they would do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point was raised by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) about a university hostel. Again, that is put in wide terms and I think it should be relevant to situations which are likely to develop in the future in which different kinds of arrangements for the provision of university hostels may well develop. There may be cooperative housing associations; there may be associations which are partnerships of the students themselves and the university; there may be partnerships between students, local authorities, university authorities and so on. One knows that in some cases a town council has been concerned with the whole question of student provision when a new university is being built. We must not impose a duty upon an education authority but allow that authority to spend money in the widest possible way, provided it meets the general requirements which I have already described. I think it would be only sensible, when we are setting up these powers, to ensure that we put them in their wider context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the provision in Section 25(1) of the 1962 Act in connection with teachers' remuneration, this condition is in fact expressed in now rather out-dated terms, but it could have been incorporated into this Clause with more up to date wording, but we felt generally that that was hardly necessary. First, a local education authority will be very well aware of this point and very conscious of the need to concern itself with the remuneration of the teachers concerned at any establishment before they give any payments to that establishment. Paragraph
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>396</span>
(	<i>c</i>) of the subsection provides for the approval of the Secretary of State and the kind of matters which can be taken into account. I do not believe, therefore, that it is necessary to replace this in the legislation we have under this Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell), grants for students attending the Royal Ballet School or any other further educational establishment come under rather different provisions from those in this Clause. They are already provided for in the 1962 Act. I would refer him, in particular, to Sections 49 and 50 of that Act. Generally speaking, they are at the absolute discretion of the educational authority so that there is no question of their being restricted. It is rather a question of whether they should exercise the discretion they have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far as educational research is concerned, again it is right that an education authority should have power to assist educational research, particularly, though not exclusively, larger education authorities which should certainly feel free to sponsor and assist in such research which may be directed to problems in their own schools, as well as having general application. I am well aware of the need to ensure that there is no duplication in this field, and certain research is helped directly by the Department. There is also certain research which has help under the Scottish Council for Educational Research. Education authorities are well aware of what is going on in that field. Current projects are listed every year in the Scottish Education Department's Annual Report so that there should be no question of people duplicating research out of ignorance of what is going on elsewhere. Again, we must rely on the common sense of education authorities not to get involved in such duplication. In any case, education authorities with the demands which are put upon them at the present time for all kinds of things are unlikely to be anxious to squander money on unnecessary educational research. Apart from anything else, the normal financial stringency will prevent them doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Wright) mentioned the proviso to Section 25(3) of the 1962 Act. That relates to a subsection dealing with grants to a school, and this is excluded under

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>397</span>
paragraph (c) in the new Section 25(1) which we are discussing, but in any case, the approval of the Secretary of State is involved here, and again, we can rely on the good sense of an authority not to give grants to a school enabling it to make a profit or to do more than cover its deficiency; so that that kind of restriction should be eliminated from legislation because it does not mean much. After all, we should try to simplify legislation as we have sought to do in this Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Member. At least my intervention made that possible. I agree with him that in its exactitude and definition this Clause is an improvement on the original Section, even recognising that sometimes the more we define the more we tend to exclude; that is accepted. But within the limits of this Clause local authorities in education have very full powers to meet demands, and my experience with the Glasgow education authority has always been that where there was a demand for a particular type of education, even though it might not have been an orthodox one, the local education authority was always very happy to make provision for the carrying on of any type of education which met a local demand. That is now expressed in very exact terms here, and I thank my hon. Friend for what he has said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I also asked how many of these related to the course of secondary education selected for the child at the time of transfer from primary to secondary education, and how many appeals were allowed. The right hon. Gentleman was good enough to reply to the Question, and I have added up the number of appeals for each of these years so as to provide a total figure. It is interesting to note that the total number of appeals to the Secretary of State under Section 29 of the 1962 Act over the last five years totalled 640. Of those, the vast majority, 617, related to the course of secondary education selected for the child at the time of transfer from primary to secondary education. Perhaps I could add, in parenthesis, that 156 of those 640 appeals were upheld.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is interesting, but it is irrelevant to my main objection. The interesting point is that, not surprisingly, the largest

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>401</span>
number of appeals related to the transfer of a child from primary to secondary education, and that right of appeal is not being removed by this Clause. Parents will still be able to appeal to the Secretary of State about the child's educational course at the moment of transfer to secondary education. But the other appeals, of which there were 23, must have related to the course selected for the child after that child had started its secondary education, and it is in those cases that the right of appeal will be removed altogether.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the last five years there have been to the Secretary of State 23 appeals which will now be rendered impossible in future by the terms of this Clause. Over the last five years 23 families in Scotland have exercised a right conferred on them, which no families will in future ever be able to exercise again. The hon. Gentleman may feel that 23 families do not matter very much. I believe that the right which these 23 families have pursued is one which should be continued for them and for others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yet I suggest that the cold figure of 23 does not represent the influence which this right has had in determining the education which children receive at the secondary state. All of us know how this works. We know from our constituency experience what is the reality of the situation. Every one of us in this Room will have had letters from constituents, complaining about the decision reached by the local education authority about the secondary course for their child. Very often a parent will write to the Member of Parliament saying, "My child has been transferred to a junior secondary course, whereas I know from the child's performance at school that he really ought to have been selected for the senior school." Certainly, this is a difficulty which will be lessened as the comprehensive system spreads. But equivalent problems will arise within the comprehensive system for which the right of appeal should also be preserved, and I shall come to that in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all know that many parents are concerned about the choice made by the local education authority. The advice which I normally give to those parents is that it is very often possible to resolve
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>402</span>
the problem locally. Obviously, there are occasions when the parent's assessment of the aptitude and ability of his child exceeds the true level, and I will not pursue that, but there are occasions when the choice made by the local education authority about the nature of a secondary course for the child is a marginal one. We all know of the child who just misses the secondary course of the parent's choice. In those circumstances it is not my practice to write to the Secretary of State, as Members do about many problems. The course I follow, and I am sure many other hon. Gentlemen do this, is to write to the local authority, not to try to pull strings for the child, but to call the attention of the authority to the fact that the parents of a child are concerned because of the nature of the course selected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On every occasion I have done that, my own local education authority has very fairly reviewed its decision. It has looked into the facts again. More often than not, it writes back to say it must adhere to its decision, but there are occasions when the decision is reversed, in a marginal case, or if a place becomes available. However, the assurance that is always given is that the progress of the child will be reviewed after a year at the secondary school, so that a transfer can be made at that stage should the child's progress and his ability and aptitude justify it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the knowledge of parents that a local education authority will keep the matter under review for, let us say, a year is a very great reassurance to them, and under present legislation, if after a year they find that their child has not been transferred as they hoped, they have the right of appeal to the Secretary of State. I believe many parents have accepted the decision of the local education authority at the moment of transfer without making a fuss, without making an appeal to the Secretary of State, because they know that the local education authority will review the matter in a year, and that if the authority does not transfer the child as the parents wish, they then have the right of appeal. It is the existence of this right which, perhaps, counts even more than its use by the parents. But this is going to be removed by this Clause. That is a very serious interference with the freedom of parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>403</span>
I turn now to some of the problems and anomalies which will flow from this Clause. I mentioned a moment ago that many parents are disappointed at the decision that their child should go to a junior secondary school, although the child will receive a very good education there. There is a feeling that this is a form of selectivity, and it is hurtful to the parents. I accept that that is so, and I also accept that that sense of hurt will not exist in a comprehensive system, but at once one faces another problem. We know from our earlier debates that, despite all their previous loose talk about selectivity being a sin, the Government recognise that selectivity of some kind is essential in all forms of education. We know that if comprehensive education is to work there must be selectivity during the course of that comprehensive education. A child will be selected and screened for one course of education or another within the comprehensive school. It is, therefore, ludicrous and misleading to suggest that within the comprehensive system there is no selectivity, because there is selectivity. It is clear that in some comprehensive schools, at least, pupils will follow a common course during their first and second years of secondary education, and after that period they will be selected for a course for which they have a particular ability and aptitude.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why will the parents be denied the right of appeal to the Secretary of State? It is going to become even more important as the years pass, more important as the comprehensive system spreads, and more important as the need for selectivity within the comprehensive system is recognised, that parents should have this right of appeal, because in the end there is very little difference of principle between having the right of appeal against the transfer of a child to a junior secondary school, and having the right of appeal against the transfer of a child a year or two older, within a comprehensive school, to a course which the parent regards as inappropriate for that child. I find it very difficult indeed to see any difference of principle between the two, and it is the principle about which we are arguing—the principle of liberty for parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to one or two other difficulties. All of us wish to see great industrial development in Scotland. All of us will agree that, if that development
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>404</span>
is to go ahead as we wish, there must be a greater degree of mobility of labour in Scotland. People must be readier to move from point A to point B, and the structure of local government, housing and so on, should recognise that need. It is clear that many parents, perhaps more in the future than in the past, will move from one part of Scotland to another as part of the process of industrial development, bringing with them the children. Many children will be transferred, through movement of the parents, from one school to another during the secondary course, not through a decision of a single local education authority but because of the consequences of the parents' move from one town to another. Obviously, the receiving local education authority will take serious account of the type of education which the child had been enjoying in his previous school, and will no doubt try to match it if that can be done, but there must be occasions when the precise course which that child had been following cannot be matched locally, and in a circumstance of that kind the parent should have the right of appeal against the decision of the receiving local education authority. That right will disappear if this Clause goes through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I ask the Minister what will be the position for children of English parents moving from England to Scotland? A similar problem will confront them. What will be the position confronting the parents of a child coming back from abroad? There are many Scots working throughout the world whose children are being educated locally in Canada, Kenya, Australia, and all over the world. What happens to the child who returns from Kenya at the age of 15½, and is then placed by a Scottish local education authority in a course which the parents regard as unsuitable? They will have no course of appeal open to them. I am sure there are many other anomalies which will arise if this Clause goes through unchallenged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, perhaps I could direct the Minister's attention to the title of Section 29, which he is going to amend so considerably by this Clause. The title of Section 29, which will continue as it is not being changed, is
	<br><blockquote><p>"Pupils to be educated in accordance with the wishes of their parents."</p></blockquote>
The Minister should have those words framed, staring him in the face every

day, because throughout our debate on this Bill we have seen the Minister's total carelessness with the wishes of parents. We have seen how the freedom of parents is being eroded by this Bill in Clause 1, and again, substantially, now, and it is unforgiveable that in Clause 7 the Minister should be proposing to remove a right which was at the centre of the freedom enshrined in the title of that Section of the parent Act. I trust that the Minister will review Clause 7 and will change his mind before the parents of Scotland lose yet another freedom which has been guaranteed to them by Statute over the years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

In the past three years I have not always been able to take part in the Scottish Committee proceedings because I have been in Room 16 as a Member of a Select Committee engaged in closely scrutinising certain matters in great detail. Easily the most effective education work being carried out in Westminster at the moment is that by the Select Committee on Education and Science and in my view Sub-Committee "C"——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I still cannot see the relevance of this. We are dealing with the restriction of the right of appeal. I would ask the hon. Member to stick to that theme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is not to talk about Select Committees, but for hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are getting away from the Clause. I have said that points have been very well made about absence, presence, and meanderings. We will now leave them and stick to the restriction of the right of appeal contained in the Clause.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was saying that my colleagues have a right not to have tc listen to me if they do not want to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am somewhat baffled about why this is necessary, and I await with interest the reasons, which I am sure are good ones, which will be given by my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a certain sympathy with the hon. Gentleman the Member for Perth and East Perthshire when he says that the existence of the right is important. All of us receive these kinds of appeals. It is almost immoral of M.P.s to try to pull educational strings on behalf of particular constituencies. Once when unwittingly I tried to do so, within six months of coming to this place, I was properly rebuked and have never done so since. One has to be careful. Nevertheless, the existence of these rights is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember that when I was a teacher in Bo'ness Academy I threatened the Headmaster, probably presumptuously, with an appeal to the Secretary of State. This related to four boys for whom I was responsible as the so-called "registered teacher" in Bo'ness Academy. I said that if they did not get promotion, I would no longer remain a teacher in school. Since there was a great staff shortage, he eventually succumbed with better grace than I had any right to expect. The threat of writing to the Secretary of State was used. Although one of the boys was a complete academic failure, two went on to take their certificates successfully, and the fourth ended

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>407</span>
up with an engineering degree. Had I not been bloody-minded on that occasion, he would not have done so and they would not have qualified for higher education at all. I was only able to get something done by threatening to go to the Secretary of State and creating a fuss. Therefore, this right of appeal to the ultimate authority should not be lightly dispensed with.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clark Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) that there seems to have been a whittling down of the right of appeal, for which there has been no explanation. If one goes to a private school and something goes wrong and one does not like it, one can always buzz off and go to another one. In that way one has an effective right of appeal. However, in this matter that will not apply, though I do not see why the State schools should not be put in the same position as private and public schools. Since this is the wish of the hon. Members opposite, they are almost bound to vote for a change of this sort.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir J. Gilmour</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee are worried about social behaviour and feel that there is a real need to get parents interested in what is happening to their children. Parents must not feel that they can wash their hands of responsibility for their children just because they are at school; nor must the teachers feel that they are free from responsibility for the children when the school hours are over. I consider that there is a real need to try to bring together more closely both parents and teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Against this sort of background of social behaviour which exists at present, I feel that it would be wrong to take away this right of appeal. I doubt whether many people in Scotland know that the right exists. It will only be when the right is taken away that half the people in Scotland will know that such a right exists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman the Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) mentioned the sanction of writing a letter, but the percentage of constituents who write to their M.P. is infinitesimal. A figure of 23 was mentioned as the number affected, but it is probably only scratching
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>408</span>
the surface of the large number of dissatisfied people. If the Minister could show good reason for taking away this right and that that would bring parents and teachers closer together into a proper community of interest, then I should be satisfied, but, on the face of it, it is difficult to understand that it is the right thing to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is my most puzzling moment in this Committee. I thought that something terrible was happening when the hon. Gentleman the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) was speaking. I wonder why he was making all the fuss. If he feels so strongly he could have put down an Amendment. Or perhaps he has not studied the Clause. Why did he not put down an Amendment seething with all the indignation he has displayed? Does he know what happens in schools?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
And does the hon. Gentleman the Member for Fife, East (Sir J. Gilmour) not know that in Scotland and in England parent-teacher associations, function all the time, I have attended them, and I know that today parents are more intimately associated with schools than was ever the case in my teaching experience.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir J. Gilmour</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not realise that the hon. Gentleman was so stiff. I apologise. I am prepared to take what the hon. Gentleman says, but I am not satisfied that an enormous number of parents attend these meetings. It may be easy to achieve in cities where school and parents are in close proximity, but in many rural districts teachers are sometimes ten or twenty miles away from the areas in which they work as teachers and this leads to difficulties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not stiff at all! I am quite friendly, though perhaps not so pliable as the hon. Gentleman may think. These organisations exist to enable parents to go to the school to consult teachers and to find out in a friendly manner how their children are progressing. In addition, reports are sent by the school to the children's homes. Even parents who do not live near enough to

Gilmour) to raise about the interest of parents, and it was valid for the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, and I shall leave the matter, but in view of all the associations which exist between the parents and the teachers, the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is not a matter which would be put right by Amendment. The way in which it could be put right is by getting rid of the Clause completely, as we propose to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot understand why this right of appeal is in the Bill at all. It runs contrary to the intentions of the Government generally in the Bill, and in many ways is contrary to the earlier admirable sentiments expressed by the Minister earlier. If I understood his comments on the question of selectivity and fee-paying it was that one of the objects of all this, including the introduction of comprehensive education, was that the old idea of a single, crucial transfer point in a child's education should be softened and, indeed, removed altogether. Arguments were advanced to try to get away from the idea of transfer at some particular point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is silly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think the hon. Gentleman is right. His natural loyalty is encouraging him to overlook this difficulty. It has been said so often how
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>410</span>
wrong it is to make one irrevocable decision about a child's future at one point, and one point only, in its career at the age of 12-plus. It was described how one written examination could blight a child's future, which was one of the things which was sought to be eliminated. I, too, would like to eliminate that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be quite wrong, having done all that, for the Minister to introduce a Clause which at least tacitly—I would say, more strongly than that—recognises that at one point the decision has to be made, and that the parent at that one point has the right to appeal to the Secretary of State, and yet removes the wider right. It is apparently quite all right for him to appeal then, quite in order for him to go to the Secretary of State and to say that he thinks a mistake has been made at the point of transfer from primary to secondary, but a year later, apparently, it is not to be all right. Apparently the Secretary of State is not to be appealed to a year or two years later. Why?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could have understood it if the Minister had said that there must be written into this Bill provisions for appeal very frequently, every year. I would not have agreed with that, but I could have understood it. I could have understood it if he had said there must be no appeal to the Secretary of State, that the principle of appeal is wrong and never should have been allowed. I could have understood that, too, although I would not have agreed with it. But to say that we must wash out the examination at 12-plus, having said that the advantage of comprehensive education is that children whose abilities develop at different rates can change, according to their abilities and aptitudes, the courses they take in different parts of their school careers, and then to give the parents right of appeal at one age and deny it at every other age, seems to me to be the height of illogicality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would be most interested to know why the Minister has done this. Surely it cannot be that this is a simplification of administration in the Scottish Education Department? It cannot seriously be argued that a total of 23 appeals over five years can have put such an intolerable burden on the excellent officers in the Department that this must be swept
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0673">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>411</span>
aside as part of the Prime Minister's supposed reduction of the immense increase in the Civil Service which there has been over the past few years. So here there is no detectable advantage in the saving of administration or time or trouble. Here we have the Minister who has been preaching to us about flexibility in children's education removing the right of parents to appeal at all except at one point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I touch also on a point which my hon. Friend made about people moving their place of residence. This is of tremendous importance, not only if they move from one part of Scotland to another part of Scotland but if they come from England or other parts of the United Kingdom or abroad. It is possible that in different parts of the British Isles the education system will be very different in many ways, and it certainly may be for children who have been living abroad or in England. The parents may have been quite satisfied with the educational decision made in England for their child's future. If owing to employment or something else they move to Scotland when the child is aged 13, 14 or even 15, they are then to be told, when they come, that their child is to be given a course of education with which the parents do not agree, something they consider is not suitable for the child's future or aptitude. They are now going to be told if they do not agree with it they will have to leave it at that, they have no right of appeal; they cannot appeal because their child has passed the age of transfer from primary to secondary education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why? What advantage is there in not allowing those parents; a tiny minority, the right of appeal in a strange town or county, or even country if they have come from abroad? Why deny them the right of appeal to the highest person in this respect, the Secretary of State?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do press the Minister to believe that I am not raising this matter in a spirit of party controversy. It will cost the Minister nothing to concede this point, but it will give reassurance to a small number of parents who may wish to make use of it. The Minister could graciously give way to the feelings of this Committee and agree to this, so that we can get on with this Bill and do a good turn to parents and to education in Scotland at the same time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) has made a magnificent speech pointing out how a small provision in a small Clause is an important point of principle. I have only been in the House for about five years, but I and all my colleagues have in that time noticed one consistent feature in almost every bit of legislation—a gradual whittling away of individual rights in our society, the rights of individuals against the State, against institutions, against decisions of municipalities. The question of individual freedom is what this is all about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have seen also another consistent feature in Bills—almost an obsession on the part of Government, and those who advise them, and those who put suggestions to them, to interfere unnecessarily with things which are working perfectly well, which are causing no alarm and no confusion. This is a very great mistake. There may be plenty of intellectual and long-haired people with ideas about how things can work perfectly, how everything should be fitted perfectly into squares and boxes. We know nowadays life is becoming overrun by such people, who want everything in neat packages and are not prepared to accept things which have grown up and worked well and which have merit in that they work, and work to promote justice and preserve individual freedom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is one further example, affecting in a very important way the lives of only a small number of people. I appeal to the Minister to ignore the advice he is getting from goodness knows where to bring in silly amendments, silly bits of legislation, which interfere with individual freedom and can destroy the understanding which has grown up between Government and the community over the years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We are all getting more and more approaches from individuals who are being kicked around, who need someone to speak for them and to fight for them. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] If the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) is not getting these approaches his constituency must be unique. I know the hon.

The hon. Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) has, as so often, hit the nail on the head. He said this Clause does not affect a large number of people, it does not necessarily overturn the educational system, but is a very useful deterrent which parents can use in their negotiations with local authorities and in their conversations with headmasters. However perfect the system, there will obviously always be one or two authorities which make wrong decisions, one or two headmasters who make foolish decisions, one or two people who will not pay attention to one individual. That is why in any system of education, however perfect, there must be a system of appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend has said, 23 cases in five years is not a significant proportion, but this number might have been far greater had it not been for this useful deterrent. We are not removing this right altogether. We are removing it at all ages except at the transfer from primary to secondary education; but we are removing it from a large part of our school curriculum, when many changes can take place. It is utter nonsense to remove this vital safeguard which, I believe, has prevented much distress, much anxiety, and much complaint on the part of parents, because in their dealings with headmasters and with education authorities they always know that if they do not get satisfaction there is appeal to the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State may not accept this, but the fact is that this provision is there to protect the small man against the big authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>414</span>
It is a vital safeguard and when government is becoming more and more complex and we have more and more forms of government of all kinds at all levels any little protection to the individual is very useful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many arguments to be advanced against this Clause, but I will just look at one or two. The Minister at the beginning of our Committee on this Bill talked about experimentation. He talked about the possibility of middle schools. He said we might in the future have experimentation with not just primary and secondary education; we now have a system of education which allows for a great deal of experimentation, when in the long-term future there may not be primary and secondary schools, but we may have strange schools in the middle to cover, say, 10 to 14 years of age, with perhaps a secondary top later on. There is scope for a lot of experimenation in this Bill and the Minister has said he wants to encourage this, that he will look sympathetically at local authorities which want to experiment. Suppose there is an experiment which breaks up the normal division between primary and secondary education. How will this aopeal work then?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member does not realise it but he is arguing the case for the Clause. He thinks he is arguing the case against it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If this is so, I wish the hon. Gentleman would make it clear to me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is talking about time. If the hon. Member is bored I suggest he measure the column inches of the OFFICIAL REPORT of this Committee's proceedings and see what a substantial part of the time has been taken up by Members opposite. Unlike many Committees I have been on, time here is being taken up by Members opposite, and this Committee is almost unique in that Members on this side have put their points briefly though sincerely, and the delay has been caused by Members on the other side.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope, Mr. Jennings, you did not think I was criticising you——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I did not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I was trying to stop that part of the discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ask the Minister, if we do have this kind of experimentation in primary and secondary education and the form we know now is restructured by an authority conducting an experiment with his approval, how will this safeguard operate, because the general appeal which is available now will be restricted to the transfer between primary and secondary education?
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second question we have to ask is that which has been raised by several hon. Members opposite. How will this affect the late developers? Although late developers, are claimed to form a large section of our community I have never been impressed by this fact as far as academic progress is concerned, but there are circumstances which cause children to develop their talents at a later stage. We know this is one of the arguments against selectivity. So will it be fair, if the education authority makes an incorrect assessment, that the parents should have no right of appeal in the case of a late developer?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from anything else, we are talking about this when there is a serious staffing shortage and a high turnover of staff in some of the schools. In those circumstances, when the education of an individual may be seriously affected by having a large number of teachers in a short time, is it fair that, when an assessment is made at the time of the transfer from primary to secondary education, no appeal should be allowed at any other time, even though the previous attainments of that pupil may well have been adversely affected simply by staffing problems?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>416</span>
Another nail was hit on the head by my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger). He said this was inconsistent as well as wrong, and so it is, because the whole trend of the argument has been how unfair it is, and how wrong. The Minister is saying to parents, "Your only appeal is at the time of this transfer from primary to secondary education", and therefore if the education authority is wrong—they do not usually make mistakes but it could happen—these pupils who are late developers, though they may not count for much in the statistics, are of enormous importance to their parents, and it seems to me to be utterly inconsistent that this should be the only time when an appeal is allowed to be made. Indeed, I know one junior school where a number of transfers have taken place at the second year stage. All the problems at that school were solved in collaboration with the headmaster.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from anything else this is, un fortunately in some ways, a time of great change in education. We are bringing in a new type of secondary education throughout the whole country, not per haps in the academic sense, but a change is being promoted by the Government which they consider to be desirable. I would suggest that, particularly at a time of change, the protection of individual rights is desperately important, because many problems will arise simply on account of change. A right of appeal is even more important at such a time, and it will affect the whole climate of opinion within the education authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been noticeable that the only attempt to justify this Clause was made by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) who said, "What about parent-teacher associations?" Last Friday night I attended such a meeting in my own constituency and had a long talk to them about what they were doing. One point that was made clear is that while the parent-teacher association is helpful in encouraging good relations between parents and staff I believe there is the understanding in most of these associations that discussions on the individual progress of a pupil are not encouraged, and certainly would tend to undermine the effectiveness of such an association. The idea of discussing generally the problems of one pupil is not something which commends itself to these associations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman making that statement as a fact or is ne taking refuge in his understanding? He is saying that parent-teacher associations do not discuss the merits of the children, whereas in fact, of course, that is one of their chief functions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would suggest to the hon. Member for Govan that if that is his experience he must have attended an unusual parent-teacher association. The idea of 40 parents sitting round and discussing the academic progress of one child is, to my mind, out of the question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But that is their whole purpose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The point has been made and it was applicable. The question of the rights, duties or privileges of a P.T.A. to discuss the progress of individual children has been mentioned. I think that is enough. We must get on with the restriction on the right of appeal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. When an hon. Member makes a statement which is based on an understanding of his interpretation, he is taking refuge and creating an impression which he cannot defend. He ought to say whether it is or is not a fact that the parent-teacher associations behave in the way he said. They do not sit around talking. They deal with particular cases, where necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Apparently only in Govan.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a marginal point of order and I think we should leave that now. All I am trying to do is to stop a wide discussion of this matter of parent-teacher association.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You are quite right, Mr. Jennings. The hon. Member for Govan is always most able in trying to deflect us from a significant point. If I may say a brief sentence on this, he referred to the fact that parent-teachers associations do not sit round in groups——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon Member must not go on to develop that argument, even in one sentence. Let us get on with the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>418</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can see you are of the opinion that I have spoken for too long, Mr. Jennings. In fact I have a great deal more to say but I will leave that. However I consider that the facts I have put forward need to be answered. I believe this to be a foolish Clause and one that will have a considerable effect on the rights of individual parents. For that reason I think we should resist it. There are so many of these little things that together they amount to a dangerous assault on the rights of individuals, and I would certainly fight for those rights.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alasdair Mackenzie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with great interest to this debate and I shall listen with still greater interest to what the Minister has to say. I do not think this change will make a great difference. I have always believed that it was a good thing for parents to have a right of appeal, because I know that some parents, in their anxiety for the welfare of their children, sometimes overrate their children's abilities. They then appeal, and when they are told by the appropriate body the reasons why their children have not made the necessary progress, at least they have the satisfaction of knowing those reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand we have been discussing late developers. I believe that even now late developers get a good chance because, in the main, both primary and secondary teachers are interested in their pupils; they are quick to notice a late developer and they give that pupil every opportunity. I would be sorry if this change in any way affected the situation in that respect. In my view it does not affect it, but I shall be interested to hear what the Minister has to say on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think we all agree that at this stage the Bill ought to be tidied up and made as administratively effective as possible, but I still have to hear the Minister before I reach my final decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I very much regretted the absurdly overdone way in which the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) opened the discussion on this matter, especially as his right hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble), during his Second Reading speech, referred to the matter in a moderate and reasonable way, and in my reply I said that I had some sympathy
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0677">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>419</span>
with the point and I did not by any means think that the balance came down wholly on one side. That is still my view as I start to answer this debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It also seems to me to be a remarkable thing that the Opposition, who basically are in favour of a system of education which divides people up in a virtually irreversible way, should simultaneously be protesting so loudly at a modest amendment, particularly in view of the fact that the development towards comprehensive organisation of the secondary schools avoids this kind of selectivity and, therefore, one hopes, considerably cuts down the need for any appeal procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is one of the basic difficulties we are now facing in considering these matters. In our legislation we are trying to provide for two sets of circumstances. One is the continuation, I hope for no more than a transitional period, of a selective system of education such as we have in many areas of Scotland at the present time; the other is the expansion of comprehensive education, and we must have the legislation right in order to deal with that set of circumstances as well. The two systems are so different that they pose considerable problems in getting our legislation drafted in such a way that we can cover both sets of circumstances adequately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will say at the outset that I am not convinced that we have exactly the right kind of Clause here, because I am not sure that the original Section 29(2) is expressed in the most suitable terms for dealing with the kind of situation that we have at the present time. Personally, for example, I do not like the use of the phrase, a pupil showing "no reasonable promise of profiting" from a particular course of education. It is a rather unfortunate phrase, and certainly one which, in the context of the comprehensive school, is not the most relevant; because the idea of having a limited number of courses into which pupils are channelled is something from which we are trying to get away as rapidly as we can, so that pupils are fitted into courses individually, courses suited to their individual requirements, rather than being divided into certificate courses on the one hand and non-certificate courses on the other. That is very much the context in which Section
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>420</span>
29(2) was originally drawn and it is very much the context in which appeals come to the Secretary of State at the present time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, to get this matter into perspective it is necessary to have some regard to the number of appeals involved. This was given the other day in answer to a Parliamentary Question, and as the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire has pointed out, the total number of appeals to the Secretary of State over the five years to 1968 was 640, of which only 23 were appeals other than at the time of transfer. I say, frankly, I do not believe there is one parent in a thousand in Scotland who appreciates that it is possible to appeal to the Secretary of State regarding a course of secondary education other than at the time of transfer; and I suspect that only a very small proportion of parents appreciate that they have a right of appeal to the Secretary of State, at the actual time of transfer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This was something which worried me considerably on the whole question of appeals to the Secretary of State. Far from being oblivious of parental rights in a matter of this kind perhaps I may tell the Committee what we have done recently to make the existence of these rights rather better known than they are at the present time. In 1966 we sent out a circular on transfer schemes—a matter which we can deal with in a rather different way under the next Clause—asking the authorities in the light of development towards comprehensive education to revise the transfer schemes for pupils going from primary to secondary schools. We dealt with the different circumstances in comprehensive schools and laid out our view that in the case of comprehensive schools there should be no division of pupils into the certificate and non-certificate course at the age of 12, and no question of accepting the assessment of the primary school. We said that that should be a matter of assessment, so far as it is necessary to have it, in the secondary school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the circular we also pointed out that there was still a need for some kind of assessment because of the continuance of selective education, and that parental rights should be fully taken into account. That covers references to parental rights and parental consultation at many points.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0678">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>421</span>
But more than that, as we are getting new schemes coming from authorities, having requested them under the terms of the circular, the Department, at my instructions, and because I have felt strongly about this, is insisting that any new transfer scheme by an education authority which involves selection will include a provision that where a parent is informed of the selection of courses he will also, simultaneously, be informed on the form of notification that a right of appeal to the Secretary of State exists.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Excellent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has never been done before, so I take it rather ill of the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire that he should make the kind of criticism he made in his opening speech, because I do attach considerable importance to this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very glad to know that the attention of parents is being called to this particular stage of appeal and that is something for which the hon. Gentleman can take very great credit. I congratulate him. But I hope the Minister will now turn to the question of the effect of the Clause, which is to remove the right of appeal completely beyond the stage of transfer. That is what we are concerned about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am coming specifically to the question of appeals beyond the stage of transfer, but it is necessary to get the background into perspective, and to make the point that the whole intention of the Government is to remove circumstances in which decisions about pupils' courses are taken in a way that is virtually irreversible, and that it is misleading to think that a right of appeal to the Secretary of State can make up for fundamental defects in the processes involved in selection. That cannot be done at all, and therefore one must turn one's mind principally to the other possibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far as appeals beyond the age of transfer are concerned, I have given the figures and have made the point that it is highly unlikely that there are any substantial numbers of parents in Scotland who are aware of their right of appeal. I find it difficult to envisage any way in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>422</span>
which we can make the existence of that right better known to parents of pupils in Scottish schools at the present time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am only making the point that probably this right of appeal was not intended when the Act was originally drawn and that it is probably known to very few parents. I am simply saying that therefore the right is not a really effective safeguard to parents compared with other things, because in the natural course of events very few are even going to know that the right exists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Coming to the question of the circumstances in which appeals might go to the Secretary of State beyond the age of transfer, the difficulties one comes up against are, to my mind, not difficulties of principle but of practical application. At the age of 12 in any selective system it is possible to speak of courses of instruction from which a pupil shows no reasonable promise of profiting. That can be done with division into different schools, different courses, or, within a school, into certificate and non-certificate courses. One can identify the kind of thing with which one is dealing so that a right of appeal is meaningful in that it attaches to something precise, and which can be assessed by Her Mapesty's Inspectorate on the basis of something reasonably profound.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But with transfers at the end of the second form in a comprehensive school, dealing with pupils as individuals rather than dealing with certificate and non-certificate courses, where the process of movement from one stage of secondary education to another or one year of secondary education to another is the product of assessment at the school itself, as to a pupil's progress in different subjects, where these are looked at indidually and where parents are taken into consultation, as, I hope, increasingly they will be, then, as a matter of practical administration, it is extremely difficult to get appeal procedures working effectively. They do not, of course, work effectively as shown by the numbers I have mentioned. Many more parents may be dissatisfied than ever come to the stage of appealing to the Secretary of State in those circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main effort, therefore, must be to impress on schools, education authorities and headmasters the necessity of taking the parents into consultation at particular
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0679">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>423</span>
points in time, discussing problems with them and paying the fullest regard to what parents want at any particular point in a child's education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that in those circumstances any right of appeal to the Secretary of State beyond what can be done at local education authority level is very unlikely to give any substantial additional right to parents in those circumstances. Nevertheless, I certainly do not wish to remove any right which Members of the Committee generally may feel is something which ought to be retained, however inadequately that right expresses itself in its practical application, and however few may be the cases in which it may be exercised at the present time. It was for that reason that I said, in winding up on Second Reading, that I greatly wanted to hear the Committee dealing with this particular matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could not recommend the Committee this morning to eliminate the Clause because I believe the points I have made are valid and serious ones in terms of practical application. I have seen many of these appeals. Many hon. Members write to me on this subject and I see reports from divisional inspectors on individual pupils; and I know the tremendous difficulty that is involved other than at the age of 12 in the sense that appeals in realistic terms are an unfortunate way of dealing with disputes arising beyond the age of transfer from primary to secondary education. But while I could not advise the Committee to reject this Clause, for the reasons I have given, I am certainly willing to look at it again, and particularly at Section 29(2) of the 1962 Act, to see if we could not express it in rather more up to date terms which I would hope would strengthen the rights of parents generally rather than detract from them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I am unable to produce Amendments which give a better statement of what we are trying to do than we have at present
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>424</span>
I will consider whether Clause 7 should remain at all if there is any general feeling that it should not. That is a fair offer, and I hope that, on that basis, we might allow Clause 7 to be carried in the Bill at the present time but completely without prejudice to what any hon. Member may feel about it on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope we can conclude this debate this morning. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for what he has said, although I must tell him he has not put my mind very much at rest. A large part of his argument was specious. In my view it is specious to say, because not many parents know a right exists, the argument must, therefore, become one as to whether or not the right should be continued. The answer is rather to call wider attention to the existence of the right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would remind the hon. Gentleman that in his reply he did not touch at all on the point that as comprehensive education develops the point of selection is removed upwards into the secondary stream. What matters is that parents should have a right of appeal at an earlier age.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But if he has given us a firm assurance that the rights of parents in this regard will not be at all eroded in the end, that would certainly meet our point of view completely. It is on the basis that those are the terms of the hon. Gentleman's assurance that I would advise my hon. Friends to let the Clause stand for the moment, but not for long.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
