	<p>	<b>OFFICIAL REPORT</b></p>
	<time>Tuesday, 25th March, 1969</time>
	<p>[Sir BARNETT JANNER in the Chair]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>AGE OF MAJORITY (SCOTLAND) BILL [	<i>Lords</i>]</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Bruce Millan)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee have considered the Age of Majority (Scotland) Bill [	<i>Lords</i>] in relation to the principle of the Bill.</p></blockquote>
This Bill is modest, and its purpose is reasonably clear—to lower to 18 the age at which a person attains majority or full age and ceases to be a minor under Scottish law. The Bill is complementary to two other Bills now before Parliament, the Representation of the People Bill, which lowers the voting age to 18, and Part I of the Family Law Reform Bill, an English and Welsh Measure only, which implements the main recommendations of the Latey Committee by lowering the age of majority in England and Wales to 18 and removing from young people between 18 and 21 the substantial disabilities from which a minor suffers under English law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would remind the Committee of the general attitude which the Latey Committee took to the question of lowering the age. It was a Committee dealing only with England and Wales, but some of its general points have relevance to Scotland as well. In paragraph 132, for example, it said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Young people today, as the old never tire of remarking, are not what they were. They are largely literate and educated; they are far better off financially and far more independent of their parents; they are taught to think and enquire for themselves and mostly do so; and their experience of life is wider. The question is not whether this is a good thing or a bad thing, but what are we to do about it. This Committee is convinced that we must ensure that the young go out into the world as fully prepared for their adult responsibilities as possible, and that in giving them adult status at 18 we are doing no more than recognising the simple facts."</p></blockquote>
I would agree very much with those sentiments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will, of course, be aware that, under Scottish law, the minor—that is, a boy between 14 and 21 or a girl
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
between 12 and 21—has always enjoyed a measure of freedom which has been denied to the minor in England and Wales. He has the legal capacity to enter into binding contracts, he can acquire and dispose of property, both moveable and heritable, and can make a will dealing with both. He can marry without parental consent, provided that he is 16, and the procedure by which a young person can be made a ward of court—a controversial matter in England sometimes—is unknown to Scottish law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from these rights, the minor in Scotland is afforded a special measure of protection from the courts: if he is foolish enough to enter into a contract which is seriously to his detriment, he can apply to have it reduced and can challenge a contract entered into during his minority at any time up to the expiry of the period known as the 	<i>quadriennium utile</i>, that is, the four years immediately following the attainment of his majority. That provision is retained in the new circumstances. It can thus be said that, under existing Scottish law, a minor in some senses has the best of both worlds. On the one hand he has virtually full legal capacity, and on the other he has this special protection of being able to have a contract reduced in certain circumstances up to four years from the date of his majority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, we started in Scotland from a background quite different from that which the Latey Committee considered in England and Wales. Nevertheless, it seemed to the Secretary of State that, in the light of the Latey Committee, it was desirable to reappraise the general position of the age of majority in Scotland. Therefore, after the Government decided to implement the Latey recommendations in England and Wales, something which was announced last April, the Secretary of State consulted a number of organisations in Scotland which might be expected to have a view on the social as well as the legal implications of any change in the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should tell the Committee that neither the Faculty of Advocates nor the Law Society of Scotland saw any real need for legislation on the subject. Both emphasised the benefits enjoyed by young persons in Scotland under the existing law, but they recognised that there were considerations pointing the other way and made some suggestions which have been taken into account in drafting the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0189">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
The other organisations which were consulted, however, which included the Convention of Royal Burghs, the Counties of Cities Association, and the Association of County Councils, among the local authority associations, the S.T.U.C., the N.F.U., the Scottish Landowners' Federation, and one or two others, favoured lowering the age of majority in Scotland at the same time as in England and Wales. After considering the various comments the Secretary of State decided that the balance of advantage lay with making the change in Scotland. The decision to legislate was announced last November in reply to a Question by my hon. Friend the Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Mr. Maclennan).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before explaining the provisions of the Bill, it might be helpful to summarise the arguments which led my right hon. Friend to conclude that the balance of advantage lay with introducing the Bill, despite the rather different legal circumstances of minors in Scotland at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the first place, whatever the legal rights of minors, young people in Scotland are as much entitled to claim the status of majority at 18 as their contemporaries in England and Wales. This is an important point because, unless we make this change, of course we should be in the anomalous position of not recognising the age of 18 in Scotland, when it was being recognised in England and Wales, as the age of maturity at which young people's ability to manage their own affairs responsibly is fully recognised by law. There would be considerable resentment in Scotland if we did not make this change. Even if there are not the same formal disabilities in law in Scotland as south of the Border, that is, if anything, a reason for no longer retaining the formal vestiges of minority until the age of 21.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, there are practical considerations pointing in the direction of the same age of majority both sides of the Border. Considerable anomalies would arise if the ages were different. For example, a young person of 18 in Scotland would be debarred from office in a trade union or friendly society but not in England and that would be indefensible. The statutory provisions listed in Schedule 1 show that similar difficulties would arise over age limits prescribed in other Acts which apply to Great Britain as a whole.
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
Finally, there are indications that young people in Scotland may in practice suffer from some at least of the disabilities with which the Latey Committee was concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, in the memorandum on Scottish Law which it submitted to the Committee and which is reproduced in Appendix 5 of the Report, the Scottish Law Commission says, with reference to a minor's right to enter into contracts:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Generally … in matters of importance and, in particular, in matters relating to heritable property, parties are reluctant to deal with a minor unless he or she has a curator who has consented to the transaction."</p></blockquote>
That is the practical situation and there are disabilities there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Commenting on the same point, the Law Society of Scotland has said that, at the moment, a minor has great difficulty in buying a dwellinghouse and obtaining a building society or other loan on its security. If the age of majority were reduced, the need to obtain a curator's consent would be resolved for those aged from 18 to 21, although we know of other difficulties for young people purchasing property and obtaining a building society loan, particularly at present, for reasons upon which I should be delighted to expand, but not here this morning. The legal disabilities between 18 and 21 can at least be largely resolved by this change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These were some of the general arguments which led us to the conclusion that the Bill should be introduced. Its sole purpose is to lower to 18 the age at which a person attains majority and ceases to be a minor under Scottish law. It alters the existing law only to the extent that that is necessary in consequence of the lowering of the age. It does not affect the many other features of the law of minority in Scotland which are at present under review by the Scottish Law Commission. Nor does it alter the marriage law of Scotland, which is being examined by a Committee under Lord Kilbrandon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1 (1) provides in general terms that, in future, a person shall attain majority at 18 instead of 21, that persons who are already 18 but not yet 21 on the date on which the Bill is brought into operation shall attain majority on that date, and that references to such expressions as "full age" and "minority" as they appear in statutory provisions or deeds executed after the commencement of the Act shall be construed accordingly. However, the construction of deeds
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0190">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
executed before the Bill comes into force is not affected. It would clearly be wrong to alter the effect and meaning of such deeds retrospectively by Act of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1(2) provides that the change in the age of majority will apply for the purposes of any rule of law. One effect is that the 	<i>quadriennium utile,</i> the period of four years after the attainment of majority during which a person can challenge a contract which he has entered into while a minor, will continue, but will in future run from 18 to 22 rather than from 21 to 25.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are some statutory provisions which contain explicit reference to the age of 21, and where these limits are clearly related to the age at which a person attains majority under the common law, we propose to substitute the age of 18. Schedule 1 contains a list of the enactments and Regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are references, no doubt, of similar kind in the large body of Local Acts, but it is virtually impossible to trace all those similar references, so, instead of providing for them explicitly, in Clause 1 (5) we provide that the Secretary of State shall be empowered to amend by Statutory Instrument any such provision which is brought to his attention and which it would clearly be appropriate to amend under this legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make quite clear what the Bill does not cover. There are many other references to age limits in the Statute Book—for example, in the criminal law. These references have been fixed with a variety of considerations in mind. They are not affected by the Bill unless they appear in Schedule 1. Schedule 1 seeks to change the age limits and is clearly related to the age at which a person attains majority under the common law. Other age limits, perhaps decided upon for other reasons, are not affected by the Bill and do not appear in Schedule 1. Similarly, it is desired to except certain enactments from the application of the new rules of construction which are introduced by Clause 1(2). These enactments, which are limited but which include the law relating to Income Tax and taxation generally, the law about voting, and also the Regency Acts, are listed in Schedule 2 of the Bill. The two Schedules are similar in content to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
corresponding Schedules of the Family Law Reform Bill for England, but hon. Members will have noticed that Schedule 1 contains a number of pre-Union enactments of the Scottish Parliament, some of which prescribe an age limit of 25 rather than 21.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past some significance was attached to the age at which the 	<i>quadriennium utile</i> expired, that is to say, the age of 25. The present law on this point has given rise in the past to a certain amount of confusion because in certain contexts the expression "full age" has been taken to refer to the attainment of the age of 25 rather than the age of 21. We feel that we ought now to remove that kind of confusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to draw attention to Clause 2(3) which concerns the making of the commencement order. There is a similar provision in the Family Law Reform Bill. For the reason that it is desirable to maintain a similar age of majority on both sides of the Border, it would be the Government's intention to synchronise the reduction in the age of majority in the two countries. In other words, this Bill would come into operation at the same time as the corresponding provisions of the Family Law Reform Bill in England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said at the outset, this is a modest Bill which does not make substantial change in the Scottish position, but it is a Measure which, on balance, we feel to be most desirable. I hope that my explanation has been reasonably clear, and I commend the Bill to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. N. R.

Even the Scottish Grand Committee will have its work cut out to make a two-day debate on this Bill. I could be wrong. One never knows the resources of this Committee. The provisions of the Bill, in effect, duplicate the provisions of Clause 1 of the Family Law Reform Bill together with the associated schedules. Indeed, it is the kind of provision which could easily have formed part of a law reform Bill such as we had a few months ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The need for this kind of change, and the reason for seeking such a change in Scotland, is the inadequacy of the Common Law of England to deal with the status and standing of young people under 21. The very terminology of the law of England in this context is totally inadequate. In England there is reference to the term "infants". The situation is neatly summed up in the Latey Committee Report which says at the top of page 42:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The young, and all sensible people connected with them, find it quite ludricrous that legally speaking a married man with three children and a car can be referred to as 'infant'."</p></blockquote>
That sums up the total inadequacy of the English Common Law on this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful that the Under-Secretary of State pointed out that the problems which have initiated this change in England and Wales do not arise in Scotland. Indeed, it has been said by some eminent authorities that perhaps the Scottish common law has gone too far the other way and gives too much responsibility to a young person under 21. I do not share that view, but would underline what the Minister has said, that the common law of Scotland differentiates between pupils on the one hand and minors on the other—minors being young boys between 14 and 21. and young girls between 12 and 21, giving to the latter a wide field of legal capacity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman mentioned all the important aspects of the minor's legal standing in Scotland. It to some extent depends upon whether the minor has a curator or not. His curator is normally his father. It is interesting to note that the Guardianship of Infants Act did not make
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
the mother the curatrix of a minor child. If the father dies the child may be left without a curator, and sometimes the court appoints one. If he has a curator, who may be his father or a person appointed by the court, provided that he acts with the consent and concurrence of his curator, he has the widest possible contractual powers, with the one exception that he cannot gratuitously dispose of his heritable property. One of the shortcomings of the English Common Law compared with the law in Scotland is that in Scotland the minor child has wide testamentary capacity. It was the Succession (Scotland) Act, 1964, which conferred upon him testamentary capacity to dispose of his heritable property. One must remember, when assessing the legal capacity of a minor in Scotland, that even if he has a father alive who is his curator at law, if he sets out on his own path in life then he stands on his own. He then has full legal capacity notwithstanding the fact that he is under 21. Marriage has always been treated in Scotland in a special way and is still substantially in advance of the position in England, and will be so even after the Family Law Reform Bill has been enacted. From the age of 16 a minor child in Scotland is free to marry without parental consent. This is a principle derived from the Canon Law basis of Scottish marriage law; it regarded marriage as a Sacrament personal to both spouses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are features of the position of the minor child in Scotland which put him in a much stronger and more responsible position than is the case with the minor child in England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I as a lawyer were asked to say whether the Bill is necessary in Scotland I should be bound to share the view expressed by the Faculty of Advocates and The Law Society that it makes so little difference that we could well do without it. In one sense it contracts the position of the minor. It deprives him of the privilege which he enjoys during the period of the 	<i>quadrietmium utile</i> in regard to contracts effected between the ages of 18 and 21. When the Bill becomes law, during the period of three years he will not be in the preferred position which the common law at present grants him. He will still be able to reduce contracts entered into before the age of 18 during the four years following 18, but the net effect is that that three years will not be covered as at present they are covered by the common law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0192">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
I am bound to agree with the Under-Secretary of State that times and people have changed. I have always taken the view that the law ought to recognise changes. There is nothing sacrosanct about 21 as the age of majority, except that it has been the age of majority for about a thousand years. There is no peculiar significance, apart from that, to be attached to the age of 21. During the later Roman period it was 25, during the early Middle Ages it was 15, and only later did it rise to 21 in the case of those holding what was known as knight tenure or knight service. Historically, the age of majority is tied up with capacity for military service. One has only to look back to the war years to realise that, if it is linked traditionally and historically with military service, then that liability for military service arises at the age of 18, and equally the age of majority should be linked with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real reasons for justifying this change are as follows. People today are more mature than they were. They are physically mature at an earlier age than they were. Although emotional maturity does not necessarily follow physical maturity, physical maturity is something which one has to recognise. Economic changes have given a wider freedom to people under 21. People of 18 and upwards are certainly earning more money, and one of our social problems at the moment arises from the fact that a youth of 18, in many cases, probably earns about as much as his father earns. The effect of this on family and social discipline is liable to be unfortunate, but again it must be recognised. If people of that age are earning at such a level to make them economically independent of the household in which they have been brought up, and independent of their parents, one must recognise the facts. Young people marry earlier than was the case some years ago. The marriage statistics show a steady rise in the number of people who marry under the age of 18, both youths and girls. It is interesting, although not strictly relevant to the Bill, that roughly one in six of girls who marry under 21 are under 18, but in regard to boys the figure is roughly one in 15; it is a small proportion. I am glad to see that no attempt is being made to alter the age of marriage in this respect.

Eighteen is a significant age already in many fields. One can become liable for

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that one is entitled under the Road Traffic Acts to drive a motor vehicle in a public place at the age of 18. Liability for National Insurance contributions starts at that age, and there follows the long haul of 47 years of contributions before one obtains the benefit of whatever we are contributing to. These are facts of life and changes that have been made and recognised over the years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The age group to whom we are now giving the status of the adult, as has been pointed out by a number of hon. Members on several occasions, are precisely the age group in which the incidence of violence is highest. But it is important to remember that although, quite rightly, one hears a lot about the problems of violence and young people we must not ignore the fact that the vast majority of young people in Scotland today are thoroughly responsible, thoroughly sensible, law abiding citizens. I sometimes wish that the Press would give as much publicity to the positive contributions of young people as it does to the less desirable contributions for which a very small minority are responsible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a small Bill. It is of very little legal significance, but I think that, in a sense, it is symbolic. One could describe it as an act of faith by our generation, reflecting our confidence in and respect for the young people of today. I am confident that that confidence is not misplaced. For these reasons, and in that context, I recommend my hon. Friends—indeed the whole Committee—to give this Bill the fullest support it could have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
welcomed. The hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) probably looks at the Bill as a practising advocate. If one looks at it from the point of view of the layman, I think it will be more enthusiastically welcomed by the layman than it is by the legal profession as a whole, if only because it simplifies the law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Winifred Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already spoken on this subject before to-day. I heartily agree with the Bill and cannot find anything on which I should disagree about it, but I take issue with the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) that the 	<i>quadriennium utile</i> would be advanced four years if it were added from the age of 18 instead of 21. If young people want to be equalised, they will not complain if these protections are removed. It was as a matter of fact a very small degree of protection that the 	<i>quadriennium utile</i> provided. It was difficult to establish, if one was seeking protection under that law, that one had suffered the degree of harm to entitle one to reduce the contract. I do not think young people will fret if that kind of protection is reduced or transferred to another age.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In advancing us to the day when, I hope, all legal disabilities will start and stop at the same age, this Bill is a step forward. There is a great deal in the logic of the variety of ages at which young people can do certain things, but I should like to see one age chosen at which having a drink or having any kind of licence or initiative over money would be allowed. That is the stage to which we should be advancing. The law of Scotland has always given young people a high degree of freedom. They have all the responsibilities of living alone and supporting themselves and even the responsibilities of marrying at an earlier age than in England, but not that of voting—and that at a time when the world is getting smaller and young people are more interested in affairs, perhaps because of television by which they see the world's news every day. They are ready for an advance in this way. I believe the age of majority should be reduced and I support the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think anyone could say that this Bill has had
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
what might be described as a controversial progress so far. I have no intention of disrupting the somewhat comfortable apathy which has surrounded it. I saw with some amazement that it passed through all stages in another place in a very short time. The debates took up just over six columns of 	<i>Hansard.</i> That would seem to have set some sort of record, I would have thought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously, no one will oppose the Bill, although one or two of us may be slightly puzzled about why it has been brought in. I have said in the past, and I think most people would agree, that there is no particular merit in having uniformity of the law of England and of Scotland, at least on the technical level. I accept, however, and I have also argued, that in other circumstances, if we are talking about the social basis of law, 	<i>prima facie</i> there is a case for saying that there should be uniformity on either side of the Border. It would be regrettable if any great gulf existed between the laws of England and Scotland in that important field. But I am not convinced that a very strong case has been made by my hon. Friend for the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been a little—not alarmed, for that is far too over-strong a word—surprised at some of the doubts which seem to have emerged in explanations of why the Bill is necessary. In another place the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, posing the question whether legal capacity to enter into binding contracts should be reduced from 21 to 18, said that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the question which immediately arose was whether, if this particular recommendation were to be implemented for England and Wales, any convincing evidence or arguments could be adduced to justify maintaining the 	<i>status quo</i> in Scotland."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>House of Lards,</i> 28th January, 1969; Vol. 298, c. 1152.]</p></blockquote>
I am not at all sure that that sentence should not have read: "Given the fact that it was introduced in England, the question which immediately arose was whether any convincing evidence has arisen to make it necessary to change the situation in Scotland". There is quite an important distinction. I am not sure that one should assume that the law of Scotland should be brought into line with that of England. One should change the law of Scotland only if there is a positive reason for doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore we should consider whether the case has been made for changing the law. There is some sort of change
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0194">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
obviously needed. I was impressed by some of the things said by my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary. I see the point about the obvious anomaly of someone aged between 18 and 21 in England and Wales being able to hold office in the management of a union or society, but not in Scotland, but this is something which should be weighed in the balance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Glancing through all the Acts listed in the First Schedule, I am not sure that the other changes are as important. When the Bill reaches the Statute Book those between 18 and 21 can receive advertisements for betting through the post. I doubt whether it will be an improvement that they should be able to sit on committees dealing with building societies and provident societies. They will have the right to
	<br><blockquote><p>"surplus of maills and duties from comprised lands".</p></blockquote>
I shall not embarrass the Under-Secretary by asking what
	<br><blockquote><p>"surplus of maills and duties from comprised lands"</p></blockquote>
is. I am not convinced that this could not be duplicated in a large number of other ways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point was ably made in the opening speech for the Government that the law of Scotland was much more advanced than that of England even before the Latey Commission. It was pointed out that a minor in Scotland can make a will, but since the Succession (Scotland) Act, 1964, we have had the provision for disposal of property, moveable and heritable. There was no wardship in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All these were the very reasons why the equivalent of the Latey Commission was not asked to investigate the law north of the Border. It was not felt by the noble Lord who introduced this Bill in another place that there was any demand or reason for having such an investigation north of the Border. Therefore I find it surprising that we have this little bit taken out of the Latey Commission proposals and applied north and south of the Border in this way. We are waiting for the Law Commission's Report on the law as it affects minors and also waiting for Lord Kilbrandon's Committee to report on the law as it affects marriage. It might have been more convenient to have waited for those Reports and till these presumably thorough investigations
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
have appeared ultimately in legislation before we moved at all in this field.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am unenthusiastic about the legal case for this Bill. We are left with the Act of faith to which the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie), referred, and the similar spirit in which the Bill has been welcomed by the very short speeches which preceded mine. I certainly will not argue that people are mature in England at 18 and not mature at that age in Scotland. That would be an assinine position which the most conservative would find difficult to justify even by his own standards or the standards of common sense. If it is an act of faith I think it will be an act of faith confined to the members of the Scottish Grand Committee and will not be recognised as such by those between 18 and 21 in Scotland now. Their position will not be greatly strengthened legally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the many fields in which there are important differences between the law of Scotland and that of England—marriage, for example, and other fields, contracts for disposal of heritable property—the differential will remain, and probably an advantage lies with the person who is still a minor between 18 and 21 till this Measure reaches the Statute Book. I can hardly imagine that there are people between 18 and 21 in Scotland waiting for the nod of Parliament for this Bill to reach the Statute Book to take them out of the shackles and give them new freedom under the law.

I must confess I think that is a piece of optimism, but certainly if it is going to be represented as a move in favour of young people, if it is going to be represented in the country by hon. Members as a justification for faith in the younger generation, in the way it has been suggested, then it might well have some small symbolic value. I am not going to oppose it. I am just going to let it run on. I cannot stop it, in any case, but I am not prepared to offer it a warm welcome as it stands. It is my view that that tremendous traditional festival, the "twenty-first", will remain as such for a long time, and it will be years before people celebrate their "eighteenth".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

(Mr. Dewar), has given a tepid welcome to this Bill. My own welcome is much warmer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think one can make too much significance of the Bill because, as my hon. and learned Friend pointed out, it will make little practical difference to the position in law of young people between the ages of 18 and 21. Some people over the age of 21 will be affected by the bringing down of the scale of the 	<i>quadriennium utile,</i> although I think the hon. Lady the Member for Hamilton (Mrs. Ewing) rather missed the point made by my hon. and learned Friend. I do not think he regretted the loss of the protection, afforded to people up to the age of 25, by the 	<i>quadriennium utile</i> coming down the scale, so much as that he called attention to the fact that, in exchange for liberation at a younger age, there would be a loss of protection at an older age.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe the significance of this Bill is much more of a social and symbolic kind. The hon. Member for Aberdeen, South, made this point. He said the Bill would have a symbolic value, although he felt the extent of it had been exaggerated in the debate. I believe the symbolic value will be larger than he suggested. I am convinced that certain social benefits will flow from this Bill to the advantage of people between the ages of 18 and 21.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A protection which will be lost, of course, is the present protection which a minor has to avoid the consequences of a contract entered into on his behalf before the age of 21. This has led to a reluctance among firms, building societies, and the like, to enter into contracts with people under the age of 21 because of the power they have to free themselves from contracts unilaterally. The effect of this which concerns me most is that many young people have found it difficult to obtain a house mortgage. As I understand it, the effect of this Bill will be to remove that disability. Unfortunately, as we remove the disability, so the Government make it more difficult for anyone at all to get a mortgage, and I suppose that, for the present at least, one could describe this Bill as making the possibility of getting a mortgage more widely unavailable. In reality that is all the Bill does for the present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that these mortgage disabilities should be removed. My hon. and learned Friend pointed out that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
Report of the Registrar-General had shown how, over the last decade or so, the number of marriages in Scotland in which the husbands were under the age of 21 has been increasing steadily. In these marriages, the joint income of the husband and wife must be fairly substantial in many cases, and yet, under the present law, they find it difficult to obtain a mortgage. At the same time these young people find it difficult to obtain a local authority house because of their youth and the fact that they have not been on the housing list for very long. They suffer both ways: it is difficult for them to get a local authority house; it is difficult for them to get a mortgage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that this housing difficulty may have been a large contributory factor towards the marked increase in recent years in the rate of emigration abroad. It may well be that the easement which will result from this Bill in qualifying young people to get a mortgage will to some extent restrict the urge to emigrate in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Aberdeen, South made the point that there is not necessarily any advantage in bringing the law of Scotland into line with the law of England and Wales, and I agree with that point of view. It would be a great tragedy if we were to bring laws into line simply for the sake of doing so, but this is a case where the argument for having the same law in Scotland as in the South is so powerful as to override the general principle I put forward. It clearly would beintolerable—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I should be grateful if the Minister could tell us a little more about the significance of the various amendments which are being made in Schedule 1. In the Tutors Act, 1474, and the Diligence Act, 1621, there is at present a reference to the age of 25. I understand that that is now to be changed to 18, but what I am not clear about is whether or not the existence of the age of 25 in those two Acts was a mark of the end of the period of the 	<i>quadriennium utile,</i> and if so, is it correct now to replace 25 by 18 in those two cases? I should be grateful if the Minister could tell us of the actual effect of these changes. I have not looked up the Tutors Act.

The hon. Member for Aberdeen, South ran through some of the powers, many of them marginal, which the young men will enjoy at 18 as a result of the passage of this Bill, but he did not mention an important new privilege which will be enjoyed. I refer to the right to be hypnotised at public entertainments. I regard this with some concern, because young people under the age of 21 will soon be exposed to the hypnotic effect of slogans mouthed at them by the hon. Lady the Member for Hamilton and her friends in the hope that they will be lulled into an electoral trance. Perhaps we could look at this under the Schedule. Although I am quite certain that these amendments are right and are in order I am not sure that we should let them all through without further inquiry, if not now, then at least during the Committee Stage of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said at the beginning of this speech that the main effect of this Bill would be its social and symbolic value. I think that is right. There are some people who may be apprehensive about lowering the age of majority in Scotland from 21 to 18, fearing that this would somehow lead to an expansion of some of the abuses of society which we have seen practised by some young people over recent years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I hope the Government will now reflect on this and take seriously the declarations that they themselves have made from time to time about the awkwardness and the inconvenience in which this clash of proceedings and this total muddle places hon. Members of this Committee.

I was just saying that there are some people who might be apprehensive about lowering the age of majority. Any such apprehension would be quite wrong. We are doing nothing which could in any way encourage the spread of violence and hooliganism. What I suggest we are doing is, giving encouragement to the vast majority of young people between the ages of 18 and 21 who are responsible citizens and who act in every aspect of their lives with respect for the life, the property and the welfare of their neighbours. In my view it is this vast majority who really matter. The Bill recognises the responsible independence of the vast majority, and I believe its social effects may be more considerable and more promising than the trend of the debate has so far suggested. I welcome the Bill and I wish it a speedy passage through Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am not sure that we have been given sufficient reason why we should place on a younger generation great responsibility which we were never asked to bear at the age of 18.

I was under the wrong impression, but if it had been in this Bill, that would have been a responsiblity the young people had not demanded of Parliament.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baxter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not proposing to go further. I misunderstood the purpose of the Bill. It would have been a pity if this had been done without more mature consideration, and, as I see it, the purpose of the Bill is a step in that direction. If no further responsibility is being placed on the younger generation by reducing the age of majority, there can be no objection to the Bill. However, if I am mistaken and there is put on the shoulders of the younger generation a greater degree of responsibility, we should be careful, because young folk have not matured any more now than the young in previous generations did. The suggestion that this is so is overrated and over-emphasised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the 'twenties and 'thirties, among the working class of Scotland at least, young people matured comparatively early. They were forced into maturity because they had to work at an early age, and they shouldered, often, heavy responsibilities. Because with the change of economic circumstances there is more affluence in the world today, and young people are able to spend more, and participate more in the lighter side of life, it ought not to be accepted, though some people say it, that the young people have matured more than did the young in previous generations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
It is a false argument. I do not think man changes much in 20 to 30 years. It has taken thousands of years for man to change in a minute manner. I am not prepared to accept glibly, and without arguments for or against, that there is a need for the reduction of the age of majority from 21 to 18.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been argued by the hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) that because people had to serve in the Armed Forces at 18, or take other legal responsibilities at that age, the responsibilities suggested in this Bill should be added to those. No arguments have been put forward to prove the case. No demands have been made. I have never received a letter or a complaint that the age of majority is too high at 21.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel that there is a political aspect to this, and that all the political parties are anxious to get on the bandwagon, to say: "We are for youth, and we want the age of majority to be reduced to 18"—to try to get their votes at the next election. It may be asked, why 18? Why not 17 or 16? The hon. and learned Member for Pentlands seemed to indicate that 15 was the age a thousand years ago. So why not reduce it to 15?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an important question. It is not right for the Legislature to place further burdens on the younger generation. Their youth is too short and their age of majority probably too long. The responsibilities placed on their shoulders in this modern age is such that the stresses and strains are terrific and tremendous.

I was attempting to follow the hon. and learned Member for Pentlands, to whom I listened with great interest and pleasure, and also the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Dewar), who took some exception to the Bill on a certain basis. If I am wrong in believing that some responsibility is placed on youth by this Bill it is because I was given that impression by the hon. and learned Member. If he had not intended to convey that impression, his contribution is not valid because it was the point of view he conveyed to me. I was prepared to accept what he said as a lawyer, and because he had looked at this with great care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I only give a warning. I see no justification for legislators accepting without question the propaganda put forward in this Committee this morning, that the maturity of youth has increased in the last 10 to 15 years. There is no evidence for saying that the mental or physical maturity of young people has increased. It is only hearsay evidence. It is said that the size of people has increased a little, but this is not proof that they have increased in other respects at all. I do not seek to oppose this Bill, but it should not be accepted without serious thought and consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I draw attention to the question of contracts? I may have to explain some of the difference between the law in England and in Scotland. Up to the time of a Bill similar to this going through for England, under the Infants Relief Act, 1874—and an infant was aged up to 21 for that purpose—he or she did not need to pay an excessive sum by way of contract if he or she were charged too much. That was a piece of protective legislation, and I can give two personal instances of its operation. When I was at university a friend of mine had a party in London. In those days gin cost 12s. 6d. He had his brother with him. Along came a bill for £5. My friend called up the manager and said, "Look here. Under the Infants' Relief Act I need only pay a reasonable
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
sum." The manager, who also apparently knew some law, let them off with 25s. I knew of another case where a chap bought 35 quids' worth of cigars. He could not pay for them and he said it was excessive and that the trader should not have agreed. He got away with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, there was similar protection in Scotland, where 	<i>quadriennium utile</i> provided that the age of protection would be up to 25. In this Bill it will be reduced to 22. Is that right? For the law of contract in England the age will be 18 because the Infants Relief Act there will be abolished. We shall, therefore, have a difference in law between the two countries. Will there be some complication with traders and shopkeepers, when goods are ordered in one country from firms with their headquarters in the other? I do not want to pull a fast one on the Minister; this is a sticky point, but I should be grateful if he could let me know the position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like my hon Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. W. Baxter) I think there is a lot of loose talk about the maturity of young people. I do not think that, mentally, people mature much earlier than they did a hundred years ago, if at all. I do not think that mankind is any more mature today than were the ancient Greeks. Little has been added by way of original thinking to what was said by the ancient Greeks. I doubt whether we are any wiser in the real sense of wisdom than were the ancient Greeks, and equally I do not believe that we mature much earlier, if at all, than people did a hundred years ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Maturity is not simply a question of being taller or having larger muscles or better health. Universities turn out people for particular jobs more than anything else, and an extra year at school may bring greater knowledge of French, engineering or science, but not necessarily wisdom.

I do not think that there will be wild celebrations in Glasgow or Aberdeen because we have lowered the age of maturity. It does not matter what the age is: a young person can join the Army. or vote at 18 and can get married at 16.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not deny that.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Legally, many of the Bill's provisions are important, but not even the lawyers thought that it was necessary. What I object to is that a Committee should have been set up to inquire into the age of majority in England and Wales without terms of reference to include Scotland. Apparently, there was no problem in Scotland. Yet, whenever such a Committee reports, and a Bill is introduced in England and Wales, then Scotland is tagged on at the heels of England and Wales. I am surprised that the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mrs. Ewing) has not protested against this. The Bill does nothing important but bring Scottish law into line with that of England. For people under 21, Scottish law is much better than English. If we had to have a change, a Scottish Committee should have considered the matter instead of our legislation being based on the recommendations of a Committee which considered England and Wales. This is the case,
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
after all, with the law of marriage, which is now being inquired into by a Committee under Lord Kilbrandon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This tagging at the heels of England happens too much. I agree that this is more convenient, but I would rather that Scottish changes were of Scottish origin. We have been told that a trade union member could not be a secretary at 18 in Scotland without the Bill. But there is a law revision Bill every Session, and surely it would be easy to include a Clause to provide for this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not oppose the Bill, but I am not enthusiastic about it. We could have done without it, when we already have so many important Bills. However, it does no damage, and, to the extent that it brings marginal benefits, it should be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With great respect, the right hon.

	<br><blockquote><p>"	<i>To the Right Honourable the Lord GARDINER, Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain</i> … We were appointed by your Lordship on 30th July 1965, with the following terms of reference:—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>'to consider whether any changes are desirable in the law relating to contracts …'"</p></blockquote>
That can only be taken to refer to the whole of the United Kingdom and not just to England and Wales. There are also statistics and explanatory memoranda in the Report dealing specifically with Scotland. So the right hon.

There did not seem to one to be much in the Bill when one read it when it was published. It seems rather a small thing to put before the Committee, but the speeches from both sides, notably that of the hon.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0200">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
cause of the United Kingdom, it makes nonsense of a great deal of her pronouncements and of her party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So the hon. Lady is not espousing the cause of the United Kingdom: she makes that crystal clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are just two aspects I should like to point out to the Under-Secretary. First, I have a certain doubt about what might be termed our weaker bretheren, our weaker sisters—those who are, perhaps, while not mentally deficient or handicapped, possessed of weakened intellects. It is possible that these unfortunate people will be battened on by some unscrupulous sections of the community who are trying, for instance, to exploit hire-purchase agreements. It is conceivable that such people, now over 18, will be in grave danger. It would obviously be too much to expect a Bill like this to cover all eventualities and all problems, but this aspect needs careful consideration. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be able to give me some reassurance on this point. What about hire-purchase itself? Frankly, I must confess complete ignorance on this subject. I do not know whether it is possible at present to make a hire-purchase agreement when one is under 21. I would like guidance on this. It affects the first point I made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lastly, will it now be possible for someone between 18 and 21 to float a company? This may seem to be a very small point, and no doubt it will affect only a limited number of people, but if it is possible, it is conceivable that we may have some extraordinary happenings, even at high schools, and the like. Again, I would ask the hon. Gentleman to give some advice on this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This has been an interesting debate, because it has brought forth some interesting reactions, not least from the hon. Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. W. Baxter). I agree with much of what he said. We are entitled to know what basically was at the back of the Government's mind in bringing the Bill forward. One is bound to have certain suspicions, and I do not think my suspicions are far removed from those of the hon. Member for West Stirlingshire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a briefer debate than is usual in this Committee. I am sorry that the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis), has left. He complained that the Bill was the result of the Latey Report, which dealt with the law in England and Wales, but my understanding is rather different. The changes proposed in the Bill are minor, because in Scotland the position is not altered very much in lowering the age of majority. The repercussions are not very great.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill, as I see it, has been brought in on the merits of the case for lowering the age, and if a separate Committee had been set up for Scotland, it would not have had enough to do. I sympathise, as I often do, with the right hon. Gentleman's complaint that the Report of a body set up for England and Wales should automatically be applied to Scotland, but he is off the track here, because the case in Scotland is much simpler. It is more a question of timing: when the change is being made in England, it is convenient for us to do it at the same time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With only one exception, that of the hon. Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. W. Baxter), the Committee finds the proposed small changes generally acceptable. Neither the general acceptance nor the one exception are surprising. This is the pattern that I expected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Banff (Mr. W. H. K. Baker) and the hon. Member for West Stirlingshire on being able to take part in two debates concurrently, here and on the Floor of the House. I am sorry that that should have been necessary, but I will not pursue that further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill recognises that, at 18, young people can assume responsibilities for themselves. Marriage, which is one of the major decisions in a person's life, and which involves great personal responsibilities, has always in Scotland been left entirely to young persons from the age of 16 onwards to decide for themselves. This is a rationalising Measure in lowering the age of majority to 18. As my hon. and learned Friend has pointed out, the changes which are involved do not make much difference in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present system has contained some special protection for young persons,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0201">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
not only up to the age of 21, but, in effect, up to the age of 25. On the one hand, such young people in Scotland have been free to acquire and dispose of property, to make a will under 21, and to enter into contracts. On the other hand, they have enjoyed special safeguards, so that a contract into which they have entered could be altered later if it could be proved that the contract was seriously to the detriment of the young person concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This has had the disadvantage that there has been an unwillingness by some people to enter into a contract with a minor because they felt that such a contract might later be changed. The Under-Secretary of State mentioned the difficulty in regard to mortgages. I am glad that he also mentioned that certain other difficulties prevail at present in regard to the attaining of mortgages, owing to the high interest rates and the credit squeeze. It would be damaging to Scotland if the age of majority were reduced to 18 in England and Wales and then some of our enterprising young couples, who are earning enough money to obtain mortgages, were attracted to move to England in order to be able to enter into mortgages, facilities which were denied to them in Scotland because of the present unwillingness to make mortgages available to young persons. This is a reason for lowering the age of majority to 18 in Scotland at the same time as it is being done in England and Wales. I look forward to the day when mortgages will be much more easily available in Scotland, though it may require a change of Government before this happens. We must not risk losing those young people who are seeking mortgages for their own homes. Scotland's progress in the coming years will be directly linked with enterprising young people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baxter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman mentioned young people in Scotland going to England and Wales for their mortgages. I believe that young people up to the age of 21 should not have put upon them greater responsibilities than are necessary. The whole matter of their having put upon them the responsibility of a large mortgage at the age of 18, when they are not sure about their future, should be looked at in another way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is a businessman who is normally quick to see the point. I thought that he would see this as one reason for the Bill. There are other reasons, but it is one of the reasons why I believe the age of majority should be moved to 18 at the same time as it is happening in England and Wales. Clearly, there is a difference of opinion between the hon. Gentleman and me about the reasons for young people entering into mortgages. Personally, I can think of young, enterprising persons in Scotland, who have the money and the responsibility to enter into an agreement of this kind, who would wish to become homeowners. If such people were tempted to go to England because the building societies and local authorities there have a greater discretion to give them mortgages, it would be a great disadvantage if Scotland were to lose them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Lawson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to ask the hon. Gentleman what he was doing at the age of 18. Was he an enterprising young person of the sort about which he has spoken, or was he still at school?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to tell the hon. Gentleman that at the age of 18 I was commanding a large number of men. Of course it was during the war, when such responsibilities came to us; and I had to take decisions involving their lives. I was a captain at 19 and a major at 21.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would add that I was unable to vote until I was 30 because of the accidents of the voting procedure, a subject upon which I could talk at length. At the time of the 1945 Election I had been wounded four months earlier and was lying flat on my back in hospital, and my vote never caught up with me. Later I was in the public service and it still did not reach me. It is important that when people are qualified to vote they should get the opportunity to vote. The whole system relating to the absent voter and proxies ought to be improved, otherwise people who are qualified to vote, as a result of the recommendations of the Latey Report and other measures, will be disappointed when they find that, because of technicalities, they will lose the opportunity to vote.

hon. Gentleman. He will realise I was not at school when I was 18.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scotland's progress in the coming years will be directly linked with the enterprising young people in Scotland who are now in their teens. I believe that young people today have as much ability, seriouspurpose, energy and talent as they have ever had. Let us not be misled by television or Press coverage relating to a small minority who deliberately seek publicity and give a different impression.

Last weekend I visited a large firm in Glasgow which for many years has operated a sound and successful training scheme. I saw there many apprentices at work, and I had discussions with them and with their instructors. Their instructors told me privately that the large majority of these young men were concentrating hard in a responsible way upon their work and upon their future. The five years' apprenticeship which had previously been the rule had been reduced, by agreement with the trade unions and others, to three years. But at the end of the three years, I was told, those young men are better trained and have more knowledge and skill than their predecessors. In other fields, too, young people in their late teens are accepting responsibility for their affairs and their future and are giving service to others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I deplore criticism of young people based simply on the behaviour of a few, whether that behaviour involves violence, idleness or drugs. I find that most young people are working hard to equip themselves for life and at the same time are enjoying such leisure as they get.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Young people today will question what they are told. They are not prepared to accept dogma or convention. They wish to know the reason why. A logical explanation, coupled with advice, will be taken seriously and, in all probability, will be accepted by young people. It is not enough to be dogmatic or to tell them that they must do something simply because it has always been done. This is no reason to detract from parental responsibility at an earlier stage. I do not believe that this Bill, or similar measures, will give parents an excuse to opt out. Parental influence and responsibility are more important today than ever. In the early days simple discipline is required, but later, in their teens, young people expect explanations and advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members have mentioned the matter of hooliganism, but this is certainly
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
not confined to young people. If the reasons for public order are explained, as well as the eventual effects upon the community and upon the young person himself, hooliganism will die out. Drugs are a cause of great anxiety to parents, but if it is explained that the taking of drugs involves the serious risk of being led on to really dangerous drugs, this will have much more effect in stopping young people from experimenting with preparations which may be represented by some people to be no worse than alcohol.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill suggests minor changes in a sensible direction. What is important is our general attitude to young people in Scotland and the sort of encouragement which we give them to create a worthwhile future in Scotland. This is of immense importance not only to all of us in this Committee but to all age groups in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill has been generally welcomed, with one or two reservations, particularly from hon. Friends of mine on this side of the Committee. The first reservation was as to whether it is necessary to have a Bill of this sort at all, when it makes so little change in the law of Scotland. I have already explained that this is a minor Bill in that sense, and I did not attribute to it an importance which it does not possess. The arguments which I used in my opening speech about the necessity for the Bill amount to a valid case for introducing the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second reservation related to the question whether young people today mature earlier. I personally believe that there can be no doubt about it either from the physical or intellectual points of view. We are turning out more educated and literate young people, who are financially independent, as compared with the situation in the past, and who, in other spheres, are asked to take on mature responsibilities. It may be, as my right hon. Friend said, that wisdom does not necessarily go with years. That is a thought which has occurred to me from time to time when listening to debates in the Scottish Grand Committee—but not of course when my right hon. Friend has been speaking. Taken as a whole, I would judge that young people of 18 are able to make decisions in maturity in a way in which they certainly would not have been making them a generation or two generations ago, and in a way which is equivalent
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0203">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
to that in which decisions would have been taken, at a rather greater age, even a comparatively short time ago.

It is worth making the point, which has been made by a number of hon. Members, that, when we are dealing with young persons between 18 and 21, we must always be conscious of the fact that the vast majority of them are responsible, mature young people who behave responsibly, not only in terms of questions of deliquency but as citizens. I agree with those who made that point. There is no real argument about the maturity point of view. The case for making the changes in this Bill is good in practical terms, although the kind of change, as has been recognised generally by the Committee, is quite small for Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What does my hon. Friend mean by "maturity"? Does not maturity take time? I have not yet discovered how a thing becomes mature by taking less and less time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Apart from anything else, I think my right hon. Friend is wrong about not attributing any connection between physical and mental maturity. All studies demonstrate that there is a very strong connection between physical and mental maturity. This is brought out in all educational studies, apart from other studies. Physical maturity is not something which can be completely disconnected from questions of mental maturity, because intellectual maturity comes very largely simultaneously with physical maturity. If my right hon. Friend wishes to see evidence of that, I shall be glad to present it to him, but not at this moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other point he raised about bringing Scottish law into line with that of England 'and Wales, obviously I am sorry to think, he was not listening to me this morning with his usual care. If he had been he would have seen that that is not what is happening because the special legal status which minors have in Scotland will continue, that is, in the case of females between 12 and now 18, if the Bill goes through, and in the case of males between 14 and 18. There will not be in Scotland legal disabilities at these ages
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
which there are at present and will continue in England and Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has not listened to me as carefully as he usually does. He said that the Bill concerned the status of young men and women of 18 in England and Wales as against those in Scotland. He went on to refer to those who suffer disabilities in Scotland. I did not say that the provisions concerning minors would not continue. I know they will, but I said that this Bill does not bring us altogether into line with England, which is a different matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend was not referring to the particular parts of the Schedule, which is all that he can refer to in the argument he has now used. If he wishes me to give reasons why these particular bits of the Schedule are bits of law where the age should be 18 rather than 21, I shall be glad to do so, but this rests much more in the maturity argument. I repeat that the law of Scotland is not being brought into line with the law of England by the introduction of this Bill, in the important sense that legal rights of minors in Scotland will rest at the age of 12 and 18 for females and 14 and 18 for males and there are no similar rights south of the Border.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nor is it true that the Law Commission will not be looking at this matter. I said in my opening speech that the Law Commission will look at the whole question of the legal position of minority, but that will be in the context of the age of 18 representing the age of majority, if the Bill is passed, rather than 21.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are some of the general points which were raised. I now say one or two things about particular things which have been raised. It was drawn to my attention that the 	<i>quadriennium utile</i> provision, which is retained, will still present a difference between Scottish and English law in this particular respect, but, as the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) will appreciate, the difference has always been there. We are not introducing anything in this Bill to continue it for more than four years past the age of majority. It will be four years up to 22 instead of 25 as it used to be. The position of minors in Scotland compared with that in England will be exactly the same, namely, with the addition of four years' protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0204">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
I was asked about company law. I would not like to give a complete answer off the cuff, but I am not aware of any special disability up to the age of 21 in company law that is affected. I have explained that these disabilities have not applied to 18-year-olds in Scotland at present, so there is no difference there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clark Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not concerned with company law, but with the law of contract. When a minor in Scotland is at the headquarters of a firm and the question of age comes in, there may be a difference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I mentioned company law not because the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South raised it, but because the hon. Member for Banff (Mr. W. H. K. Baker) raised it. There are not any difficulties which do not arise at the moment. The kind of example the hon. Member gave is not the kind in which this particular right of reduction, or right to take action for reduction, is very likely to be used. It is not a legal right which is very much exercised, in any case, but it has a certain moral effect, perhaps, rather than an effect in practice by being used on many occasions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, on matters such as hire-purchase law there have been no legal disabilities preventing an 18-year-old from entering a hire-purchase contract. The difficulties there arise from reluctance of hire-purchase companies to enter into contracts with young people without some guarantee, or consent of a parent, or something of that nature. There is virtually no legal change in the position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, with things such as mortgages one is making a change which one hopes will produce a change of atmosphere rather than a change which will affect the law very substantially. I think, nevertheless, as matters develop in future that may be very important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Questions were raised of whether or not a person, perhaps not of very great intellect, might be put at a disadvantage. There is no difference here because in Scotland at the age of 18 he has had the right to enter into contracts, making wills and the rest. If some of the arguments have validity in England they have not in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked about one or two matters in the First Schedule. My hon. Friend the
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Dewar) did not have sufficient faith in me to think that I would know what was meant by the Minority Act, 1663. I am sorry to disappoint him by saying that I know what this means, if only because I have it written on a piece of paper before me. It refers to cases where there has been a decree awarded in actions of adjudication against heritable property, a decree awarded against a debtor who is a minor in favour of a creditor. In that case there is a special provision in law that surplus rents—that is, surplus over the interest that would be payable on the sums due—revert to the minor up to the age of 21. Under the new law it will be up to the age of 18.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are several good reasons for all the items in the Schedule. I need not mention them all in great detail, but the reference to the age of 25 in the two Acts mentioned by the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) arise from the concept of maturity of full age in certain circumstances following at the end of the period of 	<i>quadriennium utile</i> at the age of 25 instead of 21.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think I have answered most of the detailed points. I reiterate the general reasons why we think that a Bill of this sort is necessary. I repeat that, of course, it is not a major Measure, and I do not think it an occasion for lighting bonfires and for celebrations among 18-year-olds in Scotland. Nevertheless, it is a useful Measure, and its usefulness will become more apparent as years go by. I recommend it to the Committee.

Before you put the question, Sir Barnett, may I thank you for presiding over this Committee this morning? I am not sure that I have had the pleasure of sitting under your Chairmanship in a Scottish Committee, although perhaps some of my hon. Friends have, but we are all very glad to have had you here. I hope that it did not prove too painful to you, as an English solicitor, to listen to all the criticisms which have been made of English law. We are very glad to have had you in the Chair this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
