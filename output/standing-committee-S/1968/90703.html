<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i></p>
<p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee have considered</p>
<p>Class VI, Vote 8, rate support grants to local revenues, Scotland;</p>
<p>Class VII, Vote 2, Scottish Education Department;</p>
<p>Class VII, Vote 4, Teachers' Superannuation (Scotland).—[<i>Mr. Millan</i>.]</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian MacArthur</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may be helpful if I start with a declaration of intent. It is always difficult to debate the Education Estimates with justice, because their scope is so wide and their importance so great. Also, the more hon. Members who take part the better the debate will be. This may be the only time when the Under-Secretary will agree with me that there is virtue in selectivity. I shall, therefore, resist the temptation to say a little about a lot, and take as my main theme the people who work in our schools and teach four children.<br><br>
But first I want to refer to the school buildings, which were the main subject of our debate last year and in previous years. After their miserable record in 1965 and 1966, the Government did better in 1967, as I mentioned last year. The latest figures for projects approved and started in 1968 show a further improvement, which I welcome, but the Under-Secretary must not get carried away by my magnanimity. He may boast about figures—my hon. Friends should not reproach him for doing that, and rejoicing over the single pearl in the dark crustacean bed of Government—but the recent figures for approvals and starts are a late repentance.<br><br>
The total number of places approved in the four years 1965–68, including last year, was 214,000, 13,000 fewer than the 227,000 started in the four years 1961–64. The starts went up from 199,000 to 231,000, the least that one could expect in the run up to 1970, when the school
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 54</span>
leaving age was to be raised. Now that we have the Departmental Report for 1968 we learn that the starts fell back during the year. They reached a peak in the early part of 1968, but, the Report says on page 81, that was
<br><blockquote><p>"before programmes were adjusted as a consequence of the decision to defer for two years the raising of the school leaving age."</p></blockquote>
What did this downwards adjustment amount to?<br><br>
Perhaps the Under-Secretary can also throw some light on the very bad completion figures. The value of secondary schools completed in 1968 was the lowest since 1964 and the number of places the lowest since 1957. And there is not much cheer in the primary figures.<br><br>
I want to refer to the general staffing problem and the difficulties facing the profession in its search for a truly professional structure. Perhaps I may make respectfully the bold but necessary observation that the status of the profession would be enhanced and would more quickly reach its proper level of dignity if there were less public squabbling between the teachers' organisations. If there are to be arguments, let them be conducted privately, and not in the full view of the public. No doubt, on occasion, teachers or groups of teachers feel aggrieved or provoked. But I hope that threats of strikes and, worse, the calling out of children to support public demonstration, will never be resorted to again. There is always the danger, in making this kind of comment, of appearing pompous, and I do not want to do that, or to appear disrespectful to a profession which I deeply respect, but the public expects a professional body to behave professionally on every occasion, all the time—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On what occasion were children called out to support public demonstrations?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will remember that there was at least one occasion last year when that happened.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The number of teachers rose again last year, but, despite that, there is still an acute staff shortage. I know that it is not easy to relate numbers to needs with precision, particularly when the size of the problem varies so much from area to area. For example, there is a current estimated surplus on paper of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0239">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 55</span>
over 1,000 primary school teachers, and this is expected to rise, yet it is in primary schools that the problems of part-time education are most actuely felt. This is simply one example of the difficulty of relating staff to needs.<br><br>
The staffing problems in secondary schools became more urgent as we approached 1970 and, now, 1972, the year when the school leaving age is to be raised. The demands on teachers will increase sharply from then, not only because of the rise in the number of pupils but because some at least of the children who stay on will be staying on reluctantly. They will be reluctant pupils, and they will be very difficult to teach. Also, they will be bigger pupils—less boys and girls than young men and young women. All this will increase the strains beyond what one would expect from the straight increase in the number of children.<br><br>
The traditional way of estimating the staff shortage has been by consultation between the Department and the local education authorities. This has never previously been questioned, and the system seemed to make sense, because the local authorities must be best able to assess local needs. The latest of these estimates of the likely secondary shortage was 3,868, but this year, the Secretary of State published Circular No. 714, and the accompanying memorandum, "Staffing of Secondary Schools in Scotland." Yesterday, he told me in a Written Reply that, in the course of discovering what he described as
<br><blockquote><p>"more objective standards for assessing the demand for teachers."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 2nd July, 1969; Vol. 786, <i>c.</i> 103.]</p></blockquote>
he had recalculated the shortage. The figure for 1972–73 is now 800, rising to 2,800 in the following year, or about 1,000 below the previous estimate.<br><br>
I accept that there is plenty of room for a continuing study of the way a teacher's time is used. This is a large research need, but I am far from convinced that the previous system of estimating needs and shortages was unreliable. That lack of conviction is encouraged by the shaky argument advanced on page 36 of the 1968 Departmental Report. There is a smack in all this of a happy fortuitous discovery at a time of great difficulty, just as the Chancellor the other day stumbled on a happy error in our system of calculating our export figures.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 56</span>
The study of staffing in the memorandum was based on a pilot survey only, and it would be rash to draw hasty conclusions.<br><br>
If one of the final conclusions turns out to be what we already know, that some areas are well staffed while others are under-staffed, which is clear from the memorandum, what remedies will the Secretary of State then propose? If there is a case for some redistribution of resources, how will it be achieved? I trust that there will be no suggestion of direction or compulson, because that would be intolerable and would be strenuously resisted. If the solution lies in removing the unattractiveness of the less attractive areas, what measures does the right hon. Gentleman have in mind, and to what extent is he prepared to inject financial inducements into the salary structure? This useful and helpful study must not conceal the fact that there will be a very large shortage of teachers at the critical and sensitive time when the school leaving age is raised.<br><br>
The recruitment figures are important, and they are a welcome advance, but what further steps are proposed? We must not let this study and reappraisal, helpful though it may be, divert our minds from the possibility that the raising of the school leaving age could be put in jeopardy a second time, not because of economic bungling, but because of an intolerable shortage of teachers.<br><br>
I must turn now to the General Teaching Council and the position of those teachers who have not yet reregistered with it. I take as my starting point the fact that the Council was set up with all-party support and, I believe, at the wish of the overwhelming majority of the teaching profession. The Conservative Government set up the Wheatley Committee. I recall the debate on its Report in this Room, and I understand that work on the drafting of a Bill had been started before the 1964 Election. The Labour Government introduced the legislation and, rightly, we supported it.<br><br>
So the G.T.C. came into being, and I have always understood that full registration with it would be necessary for the Council to function as a truly representative and professional body. Last year, a number of teachers decided not to register with the Council. I said at the time that, whether we agreed or disagreed with their motives, we should recognise that many of them had sincere reasons for not doing
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0240">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 57</span>
so. I regarded the most important of these as the doubts which many of the unregistered teachers, and some of those who had registered, had about the composition and functions of the Council.<br><br>
In a letter to the Secretary of State, which was published, I proposed that he should announce a review of the composition and functions of the Council and should state that the review would be held within a given period. Later on, the teachers' organisations asked for such a review, and, in the end, the right hon. Gentleman announced that it would take place. It was and it remains my belief that the Secretary of State was right to agree to the review, although he should have announced it sooner. I also believe that the teachers who had these doubts were right to register in the knowledge that the composition and functions of the G.T.C. were definitely to be reviewed. In the light of the Government's assurance, it would have been unreasonable for anyone in this position not to have registered.<br><br>
In the end, 21 teachers did not register and I regret that very much. Since registration had become a condition of their employment, they lost their jobs.<br><br>
10.45 a.m.<br><br>
Now we come to the present position. Teachers were required to reregister early this year but many did not do so. From the answer given to me by the Secretary of State in a Written Reply on Wednesday last week it appeared that some 2,000 had then still not reregistered. Perhaps the Minister can give us the latest figure today. Immediately after the Minister's reply last week I said that the Secretary of State was right to remind the teachers that reregistration is a condition of their employment. I also said that the G.T.C. was set up at the wish of the teaching profession and should be loyally supported. In the light of the Secretary of State's assurance that the composition and powers of the G.T.C. are to be reviewed I urged those teachers who had not reregistered to do so. Towards the end of last year, hon. Members will recall, we questioned the Government's handling of the situation, but as soon as the Secretary of State undertook to hold a review my belief is that he removed a major point of controversy. It is, therefore, right that we on this side should support the terms of his statement last week.<br><br>
I trust that those teachers who have still
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 58</span>
not reregistered should consider most seriously where the reasonable and constructive course lies. I suggest that the reasonable and certainly the constructive course is to reregister and await the outcome of the review. It is then, surely, and not now, that the representative quality and the rôle of the G.T.C. can be properly appraised.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. J. Bruce-Gardyne</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder if my hon. Friend could first clear up this point. In the Secretary of State's reply to him last week he said he would expect local authorities:
<br><blockquote><p>"to initiate as soon as possible any action that may be necessary to secure compliance with the Code in their areas."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 25th June, 1969; Vol. 785, <i>c.</i> 277.]</p></blockquote>
Does my hon. Friend support that proposition or not?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that will become clear as I continue.<br><br>
I recognise, of course, that a very delicate and difficult problem confronts the Secretary of State and the G.T.C. and I do not want today to say anything which will make the problem more difficult to resolve. Nevertheless, I must ask the Minister how long he is prepared to let the present situation continue. He cannot allow the period of grace to be extended much longer. He has already reminded the local authorities and the teachers of the statutory obligations on them, and he may have to decide very soon what further action to take. I would not want to say much more than that today. I hope his decision will be one which we can support, but he already knows from comments which my hon. Friends and I have made in the House that we will expect his decision to be an equitable one. Equity and logic demand that the 21 teachers who lost their jobs earlier this year should be treated no more disadvantageously than those who failed to reregister no matter how large or small that number may be in the end.<br><br>
For the future, I suggest that the G.T.C. should be disentangled from the mechanics of reregistration, and I welcome the Secretary of State's agreement at Question time that the reregistration procedure will be reconsidered. As soon as the review is completed and its results put into effect the G.T.C. will emerge, I hope, in a form which will be totally acceptable to the profession. The council will need to establish itself quickly as a body which is clearly seen to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0241">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 59</span>
be educationally constructive and totally involved in upholding and improving the quality and achievement of the great profession it represents.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Bruce Millan)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman that in these debates where we are dealing with a Department which ranges very widely it is to the advantage of the Committee if we try to confine our remarks to a particular set of problems rather than attempt to comprehend the whole of the work of the Department. I intend to follow the example he has set and confine my remarks almost completely to the question of teacher supply, and shall take up a number of points the hon. Gentleman has mentioned.<br><br>
In the first instance I would like to say a little about the question of school building before the school leaving age is raised. I would remind the Committee that originally the programme of school building starts for the three-year period 1967–68 to 1969–70 was stepped up to a record level of £26 million a year. Last year, following the decision to defer the raising of the age, adjustments were made reducing the programme for the three years to just under £73 million. With the addition of the two years gained, in the building sense, by the deferment there is now a five-year programme, from 1967–68 to 1971–72, and for this period we are aiming at starts totalling £125 million, an annual average of £25 million.<br><br>
So far as the three-year programme is concerned the education authorities, despite the adjustments made last year, have made much more rapid progress than had been expected, especially with new secondary schools and extensions. This is reflected in the published figures which show that starts for all school building rose from £24.5 million in the calendar year 1967 to £35.5 million in the calendar year 1968, an increase of about 40 per cent., and all the figures last year were in fact at record levels.<br><br>
This rapid progress is continuing into the current year, and at the present rate of progress education authorities will have started projects to the total value of about £89 million in the three financial years 1967–70. The Committee will notice that this figure is much higher than the figure of £73 million which I mentioned earlier as being the programme for the three
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 60</span>
years. The result of this considerably accelerated rate of progress will be that we shall now have a high rate of completions, especially secondary schools, before the leaving age is raised. The secondary schools and buildings we require will come in in good time for 1972–73.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Brewis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Am I right in thinking that the number of places actually provided by these large expenditures is comparatively disappointing? Are the costs of school building going up out of all reason?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will look at the tables on pages 131 to 134 of Scottish Educational Statistics for 1968 he will see that the figures for places are also rising very substantially indeed, except in completions for secondary schools, because completions are related to starts at a lower level several years ago, but in the case of completions the number of places under construction at the minute means that the high level of completions will show some considerable increase in the next two years.<br><br>
In the remaining two years of the five-year period the pace of starts, though not of completions, will be slower. My right hon. Friend proposes to make a further £17 million available for starts from April, 1970, and we shall be informing authorities of their allocations later this year when he also hopes to notify them of the further allocations they may expect for the remainder of the period up to March, 1972, up to the £125 million programme I have mentioned.<br><br>
Turning from school buildings to the question of staffing perhaps I should first of all say something about the General Teaching Council before dealing specifically with questions of teacher supply in primary and secondary schools. I agree with virtually everything which the hon. Gentleman the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) said about the General Teaching Council. There is little that I can add to what the Secretary of State said a week ago on 25th June in reply to a Question by the hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
At that time the number of teachers who had not renewed registration was 2,486. That was the figure at 24th June. The figure at 1st July was reduced to 2,139, so there had been a considerable drop of rather more than 300 in that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0242">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 61</span>
week, and I hope these figures will continue to go down.<br><br>
So far as action by the authorities is concerned, action in the first instance is primarily for the authorities. It is their statutory obligation to see that unregistered teachers are not employed in their schools. I can only repeat what was said by the Secretary of State in answer to a Question of the hon. Gentleman, that we expect the authorities:
<br><blockquote><p>"to initiate as soon as possible any action that may be necessary to secure compliance with the Code in their areas."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 25th June, 1969; Vol. 785, <i>c.</i> 277.]</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think the hon. Gentleman really does owe it to the Committee to explain what action he expects the local authority is to take in this matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is aware of the action that is involved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman spell it out?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The authorities are obliged to see that they do not employ teachers who are unregistered. Teachers who are unregistered have therefore disqualified themselves from employment and are subject to dismissal by local education authorities. That has been made clear on a number of occasions and I make it clear again today.<br><br>
So far as the 21 teachers dismissed last year who were mentioned by the hon. Gentleman are concerned of course the situation stands as it does at the present time. If they register with the General Teaching Council they will qualify themselves for employment. So long as they remain unregistered they disqualify themselves for employment, and teachers who have failed to register this year have disqualified themselves from employment.<br><br>
I hope that the result of the review will be a constructive one, but I am not in a position to make any statement about that this morning since we have just received the last of the representations and points of view from the various bodies and organisations interested in the review. Obviously, questions of reregistration and many others, including the composition of the Council, will all be taken up in the course of the review.<br><br>
I would like to turn to the question of staffing, particularly because we have in the Scottish Office been giving special
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 62</span>
attention to this in the course of the last year. The hon. Gentleman mentioned that early this year we published a memorandum on the staffing of secondary schools in Scotland which looked at the problem in these schools on a new basis.<br><br>
First of all may I look at primary education. The 1967 Annual Report of the Scottish Education Department contained a forecast of the demand for primary teachers calculated on present staffing standards which prescribe a maximum primary class of 45. Alongside were published our estimates of the future supply of primary school teachers, and this showed that by the current session the supply of primary school teachers in Scotland would have exceeded the demand. Since 1967 we have re-examined our estimates of supply, and the revised figures are given in an Answer which my right hon. Friend gave yesterday and which will be found in col. 102 of Written Answers. As these figures indicate, we now expect supply just to match demand in 1969–71 and not to begin to exceed it till 1970–71 and in that year only by a modest amount. It is worth pointing out that these are national figures and do not take account of particular areas of shortage which we know still exist. The main reason why the achievement of this surplus is likely to take longer than we thought—and "surplus," to some extent, is always in inverted commas—is that we had underestimated the wastage of younger teachers, largely through marriage. Nevertheless there is little doubt that on the basis of present standards there will be what I have described as a surplus before very long, although there is no question of teachers being redundant in the sense that there will be no jobs for them in Scotland.<br><br>
The better supply of primary teachers will enable us to do two things: first, to remove the remaining pockets of staffing shortage in schools where the classes are on present standards oversize, and, second, to bring about a general improvement in staffing standards throughout the country.<br><br>
11.0 a.m.<br><br>
When we are talking about staffing standards it is as well to be clear about the present position. Sometimes the impression is given that virtually every primary class in Scotland has about 45 pupils. This is very far from the truth. The average size of primary classes in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0243">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 63</span>
Scotland at January, 1968, was just under 33 pupils, and if one leaves out the smaller schools with four teachers or fewer and looks only at the large ones where 90 per cent. of our pupils are educated the average size of class was then just under 35, so that the overall position was that not all classes were around the 45 mark. However, we must recognise that in schools with five or more teachers there are about 3,000 classes, 19 per cent. of the total, with more than 40 pupils and of those there are 670 classes with more than 45 pupils.<br><br>
Just as there are geographical discrepancies in secondary education, the same applies in primary education, and the problem of classes with more than 45 pupils is largely confined to one geographical area and to the authorities of Glasgow and Lanarkshire, which have two-thirds of the primary classes over 40. As I see it, the first step is to try to ensure by every possible means at our disposal that as many as possible of the additional teachers becoming available go to the areas where they are most needed, that is to say, where over-sized classes are most prevalent.<br><br>
Until the present time we have been planning new schools on the basis of a maximum class size of 45. The authorities generally, I know, are anxious to reduce the size of classes, and many have for years been organising their schools on a basis of classes considerably smaller than the statutory maximum, where they have been able to. We have now decided to ask all education authorities, unless there are exceptional circumstances—and these are likely to be geographical rather than staffing difficulties—to plan new schools on the assumption of a maximum class size of 40. The maximum class size of 45 will no longer be used for the planning of new schools, and many local authorities may continue to plan on a class size of less than 40. This is a considerable step forward. It only applies to new building, and the problem there is comparatively simple.<br><br>
But now we come to the existing schools and what is required to bring the class size from a maximum of 45 down to 40. Then we have something which is much more complicated to deal with. In some cases this may involve reorganising catchment areas; in some cases it may be necessary to extend the schools by adding
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 64</span>
some classrooms; and in other cases it may even be necessary to build entirely new schools. If one has a single-stream primary school with classes of around 45 it may not be possible to bring them down to 40 in a simple way because there is no accommodation available and one has to look at the additional accommodation and the readjustment of zoning areas to enable one to do that. The problem in existing schools is a good deal more complicated, and we have to consider providing new schools built to a standard of classes of 40 pupils and whether we should alter the Regulations covering the maximum class size in schools generally by reducing them from 45 to 40.<br><br>
This is an attractive proposal, but I am not sure that it is realistic to carry it out at this time for the reason I have mentioned, of what is likely to happen at the schools. It is preferable, to get the flexibility which we require in the modern primary school, to proceed on a basis of average class sizes or pupil-teacher ratios rather than by reducing the maximum size of class. In doing that we will be aiming at higher standards. We intend to consult education authorities and the teacher associations in considering whether we can now amend the Regulations to bring them nearer the present situation and in considering the implications of that for teacher demand. I hope very much that we shall be able to make some change in the Regulations.<br><br>
In the primary field recruitment remains extremely buoyant. The number entering courses of training for primary work in 1968–69 was 3,043, an all-time record, which may be compared with the figure for 1964–65 of 2,049. The number has gone up by about 50 per cent. We shall continue to need a high entry into primary teaching, particularly where there are shortages at present.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In giving the total figure, would my hon. Friend divide it into two parts and tell us how many were men and how many were women?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The new three-year course for men for primary schools is attracting 300 a year, and up to a year or two ago there was no recruitment of men for primary schools at all. When these men come in they will provide a stabilising factor in an area where there is a good deal of disturbance, because of early marriage.<br><br>
The main emphasis in our recruitment
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0244">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 65</span>
effort will have to be in secondary schools. We published a memorandum on staffing in secondary schools in April this year. I think it would be helpful if I outlined the contents of the memorandum and the Circular which was sent out with it.<br><br>
The memorandum contained two complementary studies of secondary school staffing. The first, described in Part I of the memorandum, is a comparative analysis of pupil-teacher ratios in all secondary schools and departments in Scotland. The main findings of the study are, first, that there is a relationship between pupil-teacher ratio and size of school. In general, the larger the school the more economical it is to staff.<br><br>
The second finding is that there are no significant differences in the average pupil-teacher ratio in different types of secondary school. The figures are not much different whether they are four-year, six-year selective or comprehensive schools.<br><br>
Thirdly, the pupil-teacher ratio is worse in Roman Catholic schools than in other schools. The average for Roman Catholic schools is 20:1 while for non-denominational schools it is 16.5:1. That is the number of pupils per teacher. That is a striking difference, and means a serious staffing situation which applies particularly in the west of Scotland.<br><br>
The study shows wide variations in pupil-teacher ratios between schools in different parts of the country, ranging from an average of 13.5:1 in the city of Aberdeen to 21.2:1 in Lanarkshire. Differences of this sort are intolerable and there is an obligation on the Government to do everything possible to have these differences removed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will come to that. Part II is a study—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like my hon. Friend to give a little information, because the pupil-teacher ratio is causing concern in Lanarkshire. My hon. Friend says that the Government will do something about it. Would he give us an idea of what they intend to do about this serious problem?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will come to that in a moment.<br><br>
Part II of the memorandum is a study in depth of the staffing and organisation of 47 secondary schools of various types
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 66</span>
and sizes which was undertaken in order to throw more light on the factors affecting staffing and organisation and the efficient use of teachers. The hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire did rather less than justice to the study as a whole when he suggested that one had to treat the results with considerable scepticism as it had been a superficial study of the Scottish situation. That was unfair, not only to the Department but to the headmasters and teachers who co-operated, because the information for it was provided by headmasters of these schools and there were timetable details in respect of 2,500 teachers. We looked at a number of factors, the size and type of school, the shortage of teachers, accommodation difficulties, the range of courses and subject options offered, the time spent by teachers on non-teaching duties and the detailed organisation and timetabling of teaching groups and activities. This has drawn attention to the disparity of staffing standards which not only exists between schools in different areas but between schools in the same education authority area which is more undesirable than the other disparities I have mentioned.<br><br>
The memorandum is a factual account of the staffing studies and contains no recommendations for action, but in the Circular which the Secretary of State sent out with the memorandum he drew attention to the need for action at local and national level. At local level the requirement is clear and a good deal is within the responsibility and power of local education committees and local directors of education. They were asked to look at the staffing situation with their teachers and to try to ensure a more equitable distribution of teachers within their areas.<br><br>
We mentioned that further consideration might be given to methods of redistributing teachers between areas and measures to promote or reinforce such redistribution. It might be possible to modify the present scheme of inducement payments to teachers in designated schools of teacher shortage, called the Roberts payments. Some scepticism has been expressed as to whether they have made any difference. It is a little early to know the ultimate effect, but on one year's working, 73 secondary schools were designated under the scheme, and the figures so far show worthwhile results are being achieved in those schools. In the designated secondary schools the pupil-teacher ratio has improved from 22.7
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0245">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 67</span>
in January, 1968, to 21.8 in January, 1969, in spite of the fact that in Scotland as a whole in the same period the pupil-teacher ratio in schools worsened slightly from 17.1 to 17.3.<br><br>
In virtually every area the situation has shown an improvement in staffing standards in designated schools compared with the slight worsening of standards in other schools. This is a matter not just for the Government. It involves the Salaries Committee, and there is a strong argument that the scheme by itself could do a good deal in the redistribution of teachers, particularly within local authority areas.</span></p>
<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brewis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am reluctant to give way, because if I do so I shall go on for far too long, and that does not please the Committee.<br><br>
To return to the Circular, we also suggested a scheme of redistribution which would require the better staffed areas such as Aberdeen City and Fife to reduce the number of secondary teachers in their service. In addition, targets would be set to which the worst staffed areas, in particular Lanarkshire and Renfrewshire, would be encouraged to work. The remaining authorities would stand fast on their present ratios. I must emphasise that there is no question, in a scheme of this sort, of the better staffed areas being asked to dismiss teachers. Any reductions which they are required to make can be achieved by restraint in recruitment—there is no doubt about that: that is to say by refraining from filling vacancies which occur in departments where the staffing is generous.<br><br>
The third proposal was for the establishment of a more accurate and objective method of assessing the real national demand for teachers. For this purpose further studies are being made of actual teacher loads in the secondary schools in co-operation with the education authorities concerned. I want to pay tribute to the immense amount of help which we received from directors of education, headmasters and teachers, and which we are continuing to receive.<br><br>
We are, therefore, pursuing all these and other possible lines of action with all the interests concerned, including the authorities and teachers' Associations. The Com-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 68</span>
mittee will appreciate that till one has had all the comments of those interested bodies it is not possible to say what further steps may be taken by the Secretary of State, but I want to emphasise again that I consider the present position intolerable. I am clear that the Government must continue to take action, if not on the lines of the Circular, in some other way. We cannot allow the present situation to continue, and I have no intention of seeing it continue if the Government can do anything to remedy it.<br><br>
I turn now to a slightly different matter, but one which is basic to this. In the light of the study we have revised our forecasts for secondary teachers over the years up to 1975–76. As the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire said, these were given in an Answer to a Question by him yesterday, and in is HANSARD at col. 102 of Written Answers. I hope that hon. Gentlemen, and for that matter the teachers' Associations and others concerned, when they read that Answer, will pay regard to the various qualifications and notes which are part of it, because I do not want to give the impression that we are, as it were, changing the rules for calculating teacher shortage simply because it suits us to do so at this time. That is not so. I am sure that the demand figures which we have been getting so far from authorities are not accurate, and we must move to more objective calculations of teacher shortage. This is an attempt at it. I am not for a moment pretending that this is inviolable. That is something that will come out in discussions with the authorities concerned.<br><br>
The figures show that there would be a gap in 1973–74 of 2,800 teachers in the secondary schools. This is a serious gap, but it is not, in my view, an unbridgeable one. First—if I might mention one or two of the things we can do to meet this gap, apart from the measures to redistribute teachers which I have mentioned—we can intensify still further our efforts for the recruitment of graduates and holders of specialist diplomas. Sometimes the impression is given that these are going down, but that is not so. The numbers are going up considerably every year. For example, the number of graduate and specialist diploma entrants to secondary teaching went up from 1,780 in 1964–65, to 2,287 in 1968–69, which is very much a record recruitment, and we estimate that the figures will continue to increase.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0246">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 69</span>
Second, we now have the opportunity presented to us by the introduction of the B.Ed. degree which is now available at four of our colleges of education. In my view this is something with which we ought to press forward as rapidly as we can, because I see this as a most important and useful development which will enable us to secure a considerable increase in the number of graduate teachers. I hope to see a bigger proportion of these teachers going into secondary schools than is the case at the moment, but we want to see recruitment to this course increasing. It is already running at about 250 a year, and most of these are additional graduates. In other words, they are drawn from students, nearly all of whom would probably otherwise have become non-graduate teachers.<br><br>
It ought to be said, particularly in a period when primary education, we hope, is moving into a situation of overall equilibrium in teacher supply and demand, that about 30 per cent. of the girls who come from schools to the primary diploma course have at least four Higher grade passes, and therefore they are eligible, among other things, for entry to the B.Ed. graduate course, and I hope very much that we can persuade more of these girls to go in for graduate teaching and into the secondary schools, because they would provide a very important source of additional recruitment.<br><br>
Third, we rely still—and the figures are maintaining themselves, though unfortunately in the secondary field they are not improving as the other figures are—on the special recruitment scheme, and in secondary teaching we are drawing nearly 400 students per year into secondary training through this scheme. The figure is about 375. It is not increasing, but it is still a very important source of recruitment, and again I hope that, as opportunities for entry into primary teaching in some parts of the country among married women and others become fewer because of the situation in the primary schools, more of our special recruitment students will be encouraged to go in for secondary teaching. Many girls could take domestic science and become domestic science teachers in our secondary schools, rather than primary teachers and that sort of thing. I therefore look on this as an important field of recruitment.<br><br>
Finally, there is the further training of eachers in service. We have made improve-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 70</span>
ments in the financial arrangements which make it a much better bargain from the education authority point of view to second teachers for further training while still in their service.<br><br>
I should like to refer to one or two particular aspects of this, though not by any means the whole of it. For example, an ordinary graduate in mathematics can, under this scheme, raise his degree to honours standard. A scheme has been running in Heriot-Watt University, and although for the past two years the figures do not look spectacular, about 26 teachers have gone from ordinary graduate to honours graduate by this special course. Even a comparatively small number like that applied to a particular field of difficulty makes a very considerable improvement in the situation, particularly when one is turning out honours graduates in the subjects which are very much required.<br><br>
Another small example is that of primary teachers taking a one-year course leading to the diploma in physical education, where there are substantial shortages in the secondary schools. About 20 primary school teachers a year are doing this. Again, it does not sound a remarkable figure, but, applied to one particular source of shortage, and added to the recruitment from elsewhere, this is the kind of thing which helps very considerably. There are, of course, a number of other examples which I could mention.<br><br>
I should like to sum up by saying that in the primary field we are moving into a state of balance, but we still have problems of distribution, which I hope are by no means intractable. Some areas—for example, Lanarkshire—are beginning to gain from the output of Hamilton College in the primary field. In the secondary field, the shortages are much more difficult to meet, but again, in my view, they are not intractable shortages. Distribution is a considerable problem. By saying that, I do not intend to mask the full shortage, but the problem of distribution is certainly almost as serious as the problem of the overall shortage. We have shortages in the secondary field in particular subjects. I hope that the studies we are doing now on teacher loads, and so on, will make the problem in particular subjects a good deal clearer than we can see them at the moment.<br><br>
All in all, I think that the situation, while still obviously serious, contains many hopeful features in the secondary as well
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0247">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 71</span>
as in the primary field, and therefore, because of the various steps which are being taken, and which we hope to take within the next two years, I look forward with reasonable confidence to the situation in 1972–73 when the school leaving age is raised. This is a development to which I have looked forward for a long time, and I am sure most hon. Members share my sentiments on this. In the light of the figures which I have given, I look foward with confidence to that occasion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brewis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary of State has covered a wide field at a somewhat rapid pace. I shall confine most of my remarks to the General Teaching Council, but I should like to comment on two matters mentioned by the hon. Gentleman, one of which was the number of places completed. Perhaps when the hon. Gentleman winds up the debte he can give us a fuller explanation of this, because during the last four years the number of completions of places has dropped every year. I agree that there is nothing more dreary than entering into a wrangle about which side of the Committee spent more money, or built more places, but the fact is that the number of places, at 46,894, is more than 9,500 fewer than in 1958, and the number of secondary school places provided in 1968 was the lowest on record since 1957. We are spending large sums of money on school building. The costs of providing school places must have gone up considerably, in spite of such things as industrialised building, and I think that the hon. Gentleman should give us a better explanation of the present position when he replies to the debate.<br><br>
I also mention Circular 714. I do not dissent from what the hon. Gentleman said. I am sure he will agree that we do not want to coerce teachers into going to particular areas, and it is rather encouraging that in Aberdeen there are now more teachers coming out of the training colleges than there are places in the surrounding districts, but I think that the Minister might have considered what the local authorities themselves could do to provide better amenities for young teachers coming to their areas. After all, a young teacher coming out of training college and going to an area which is not his own, and perhaps having to live in lodgings, can find life extremely lonely. I think that the local authorities could do more to provide
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 72</span>
teachers' clubs, or to subsidise subscriptions to sporting clubs, and so on, to help themselves to get more teachers.<br><br>
I turn now to the General Teaching Council. Last year there were problems about registration, which was, perhaps, natural for the first year that the Council had been in existence. In the end, as we have heard, 21 teachers were dismissed. They made their point. Their stand can be admired, and, as a result of what they did, or partly as a result of it, the whole set-up of the General Teaching Council is now being reviewed. The review is not just confined to the composition of the Council, but goes considerably further and includes such matters as relationships between the Council and the Secretary of State. Under Section 6(4)(<i>c</i>) of the Teaching Council (Scotland) Act, 1965, those 21 teachers can return to the Scottish teaching profession on the payment of a trifling sum, and I think that the sooner they do so the better.<br><br>
11.30 a.m.<br><br>
This year, although the overwhelming majority have reregistered, there are at least 2,000, not 20, who have not. Once again we are faced with a cliff-hanging situation, and the same may happen next year and the year after. We cannot agree on this side of the Committee to see a score or more of qualified teachers being lost every year to Scottish education.<br><br>
The registration fee is only £1, but there will always be people who are ill, forgetful, who have changed their lodgings without leaving an address, who are overdrawn at the bank or who for various reasons put off paying as long as possible. The present system of registration is highly inefficient. It is wrong that head teachers should be delegated by the local education authority to go round asking teachers in their schools whether or not they will be registered and asking to see the receipt from the G.T.C.<br><br>
In parenthesis, last year the hon. Gentleman suffered from this when he made a statement in the House about a small number of teachers not having registered, quite in <i>bona fide</i>, I accept, and it was subsequently found that he had entirely wrong information from the G.T.C. This demonstrates that there is something very wrong with the present registration system.<br><br>
My view is that local education authorities should make bulk payments every year in respect of all the qualified teachers on
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0248">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 73</span>
their staff. The £1 could be deducted from the salary cheque of the teacher or, far better, at the next salary review the amount of money, which is in the region of £40,000, a comparatively small sum compared with the millions of pounds which are usually at stake in salary reviews, could be taken into account. This may seem to be an administrative matter, but I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not say that this is administratively difficult or requires legislation. I think all of us, with the exception perhaps of my hon. Friend the Member of South Angus (Mr. Bruce-Gardyne), would be prepared for this legislation to go through if it were in the interest of the teaching profession.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend has referred to me, I think I should make it clear that I would strongly support any legislation to eliminate this absurd business of threatening teachers with the sack.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brewis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Well, I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. The teaching profession must make up its mind whether or not it wants a G.T.C. I draw the attention of the Committee to a resolution which was carried unanimously this year at an English teachers' conference. The resolution reads as follows:
<br><blockquote><p>"This Conference, in recognition of the need for a wide measure of professional self-government, and in order to enhance the status of teachers and to safeguard and promote teachers' interests, calls for the institution of a statutory professional governing body for the teaching service."</p></blockquote>
That resolution, with a minor amendment saying that adequate class-teacher representation was wanted, was carried unanimously. The conference was the National Association of Schoolmasters Conference in England which, as hon. Gentlemen know, is not entirely unconnected with the Scottish Schoolmasters' Association. The resolution was moved by the President, Mr. Maurice Langdale, who is reported to have said that:
<br><blockquote><p>"Over the years numerous attempts have been made to persuade successive Ministers of Education of the need for and value of a Council to watch and guard the affairs of teachers. For far too long they have been treated as industrial serfs, liable to suspension, lock-out and dismissal, and having little say in the control of the profession."</p></blockquote>
It is true that the G.T.C. has been criticised on grounds of its composition. It is not always realised that it has a teacher majority of 25 out of 44, if the representation of the colleges of education is included on the teachers' side. The
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 74</span>
composition is at present under review. One wonders whether the Secretary of State needs four appointed members plus two assessors. Perhaps the number of representatives of local education authorities and directors of education could be reduced; their views are not likely to be incompatible. Four principals of colleges of education out of a possible nine seems to me to be an over-representation, although I agree that their presence on the G.T.C. is of considerable importance.<br><br>
What is undoubtedly needed by the teaching profession is more ordinary classroom teachers on the G.T.C. Here we must keep the division between head teachers and ordinary teachers. In the nature of things, the head teacher is likely to be better known in the town than a teacher who spends so much of his time teaching in the classroom. If the distinction were to be done away with, the result might be frustrating and, instead of getting more ordinary classroom teachers on the G.T.C, we might end instead by getting more head teachers.<br><br>
I do not favour an all-teacher G.T.C. It would be liable to be considered by the public as just a teachers' pressure group, or a trades union executive committee, and it would be in danger of losing public respect and esteem. In the last year the G.T.C. has made at least two public pronouncements which show that it is not just a teachers' pressure group. One was the acceptance of non-graduate male teachers in primary schools, and the other was the four-week refresher course for certain conditionally registered teachers. Neither pronouncement was entirely pleasing to the profession. I personally disapproved of one and approved of the other, but the taking of an independent line in this way was calculated to gain public respect for the G.T.C.<br><br>
To this extent I disagree with the views of the Association of Teachers' Action Committees which wants a full all-teacher G.T.C. The G.T.C. is there to enhance the status of the profession of teaching, and should be seen and heard to be doing this more than it is. When Lanarkshire reemployed dismissed uncertificated teachers as instructors the G.T.C. should have roared like a lion and not left it to a teachers' organisation like the E.I.S. to raise an action.<br><br>
Similarly, the G.T.C. should look into such questions as qualifications for promoted posts. It is surely wrong that an
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0249">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 75</span>
experienced teacher with an ordinary degree but not an honours degree cannot be considered in some areas in Scotland for a promoted post.<br><br>
The G.T.C. should also take action against canvassing and promotion for political reasons which are sometimes said to go on in the teaching profession. The G.T.C. should be seen to be safeguarding and promoting the teachers' interests, as well as the primary job of the teacher, which is the promotion of sound learning. This is a further reason why I think that there should be some more outside members of the G.T.C. If it is said, on the other hand, that the G.M.C. is composed almost entirely of doctors, or that the Law Society of Scotland is composed of lawyers, I say categorically that it would be more in the public interest if outside people were represented on these bodies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is not the hon. Gentleman a little unhappy about making a statement to the effect that it is sometimes said that there is promotion for political reasons? I would have thought that if this kind of damaging statement is to be made, it should not be made without concrete evidence. Frankly, my experience is the opposite, that often political reasons frustrate promotion because people lean over backwards not to be accused of them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brewis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I personally think that political views should not be brought into question when deciding whether a teacher should or should not be promoted to a post. I do not want to take this further.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Do not mention it then.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brewis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I mention it because it has been alleged, and there is no smoke without fire.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Right. Who alleges it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brewis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I allege it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Without evidence. It is sheer nonsense.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. J. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I join in? I can say, as a member of an education staffing committee, that what the hon. Gentleman has said is true. Allegations are made, but when the teachers' organisations, the E.I.S. included, are asked to make available to the local authority the necessary information, always of course they are not
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 76</span>
capable of doing it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brewis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) has taken up this point so strongly I will tell him that I personally, as a member of an education committee, have been canvassed by teachers who wanted promotion posts.<br><br>
Ultimately it is for the teachers to decide whether or not they want a G.T.C. To put it more crudely, they must decide whether or not they want to be a profession. If a minority of teachers pull down the G.T.C. and we go back to the old system, put rather graphically as "industrial serfs liable to suspension, lock-out or dismissal," it will be a long time before another Government put forward proposals for another G.T.C.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alex Eadie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There has been much discussion about the teachers and the G.T.C. Everyone of us is rather saddened because the continued washing of dirty linen in public is doing education and the teaching profession a great deal of harm. Quite frankly, I think, the reference to the political point in the speech of the hon. Member opposite, that those changes cannot be made.<br><br>
No political charges can be made against what has been done. The Scottish Trade Union Congress last year congratulated my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland for the way in which he had handled a difficult situation in relation to the General Teaching Council. The Scottish Trade Union Congress said that as an authoritative body it was entitled to make this comment since it regarded education as a community interest.<br><br>
As a former chairman of a county education committee, I have had many dealings with teachers. In this position of responsibility I came into close contact with teachers and gained a great respect and understanding for the whole profession. Even today the work done by teachers is not really appreciated.<br><br>
I cannot understand why, in the elaborate renovations of old schools and the building of new schools, so little thought is given to staff conditions. The problem now is not so great as it was when I first took part in education administration, but still, in some parts of the country, staffing conditions are inadequate. My reason for taking an interest in this is that, most of my life, I have campaigned for better working conditions, but to

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 77</span>
campaign for education to be a priority is not easy, considering the crime that we have.<br><br>
11.45 a.m.<br><br>
Like politicians, educationalists and students are going through a period of disrepute. Educated manpower is our greatest national asset, but it must be educated in the right way. I always think of the introduction of the Newsom Report, saying that children should have equal opportunity of acquiring education. Parents must understand the complex problems facing children in an age of science and technology, when they will require to go through a new industrial revolution. To retreat from making adequate provision is to do our children a great disservice.<br><br>
Therefore, all hon. Members must welcome my hon. Friend's statement that education projects now starting are the highest in history. That is a wonderful record. I would agree with the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) who dealt with this matter in a moderate and constructive way, that the problem of the school leaving age means that we must ensure not only adequate building and teaching provision but also that the curriculum does not inflict purgatorial boredom on those children who stay. The case is made for increasing the age, but we must take care.<br><br>
We have made tremendous advances. The inventiveness of men was probably one of the biggest factors in the emancipation of women, and to take the drudgery out of tending a home and family is one thing, but we must still ask whether we are using the educational talents of our women to the full in higher education. In a small country like Scotland, with a population of 5 million, two thirds in the Central Belt, we cannot afford to neglect this pool of ability. The principle that more means worse is nonsense when related to Scotland.<br><br>
I see from the Scottish Education Department's latest statistical volume, "Scottish Educational Statistics, 1968", that 90 per cent of our boys and girls with S.C.E. Higher grade passes enter some form of higher education. It is brought out that, proportionately, more boys than girls of all qualification levels continued in full time education—55 per cent as against 45 per cent. Boys entering employment, how-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 78</span>
ever, were more likely to be engaged in part-time study than girls—44 per cent. as against 25 per cent. Of those entering university, the inclination of boys was to study science subjects and of girls non-science subjects. Of the boys, more than two-thirds entered the main field of pure science, medicine and technology, and only one-fifth of the girls did so.<br><br>
I know that many reasons can be advanced for this, but I have a constituency problem here which is also a national problem. In the County of Midlothian we are to have a new technological university, and it is vital that more study should be given to reversing this trend. I hope that my hon. Friend will reply to this, which is of national as well as of constituency interest.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Margaret Herbison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) dealt with school building and said that the Under-Secretary would boast of our achievements, but anyone who listened to my hon. Friend will have realised that he had no need to boast, that he only had to state the facts to show clearly the efforts which the Labour Government were making to ensure that the school buildings would be adequate for the present till the raising of the school leaving age.<br><br>
On the subject of the General Teaching Council, I congratulate the hon. Member, who was most responsible. I hope that his speech will have an effect in Scotland. The Under-Secretary said that, on 1st July, 2,139 teachers had not registered. The vast majority have registered. It is because it is evident that here is a real desire by the vast majority to make the G.T.C. work that I hope that, particularly since there is a review in being, these 2,000 teachers will show their responsibility, and register. Teachers have always been responsible and reasonable; I hope that the 2,000 will take to heart what is being said today, and realise that the review is something they want, and is now in progress.<br><br>
My hon. Friend dealt fully with the supply and demand of primary school teachers, which, before very long, will be in equilibrium. Indeed, it is suggested that, by 1970–71, we will have a small number more than was considered necessary for that time. But my hon. Friend was right to point out that this did not mean that every area in Scotland would have enough primary teachers. He referred to Glasgow
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0251">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 79</span>
and Lanarkshire and said mat the Government would do everything possible to ensure that the extra teachers would go eventually into these two places.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire asked what financial incentives the Government intended to build into the structure. I am very glad that my hon. Friend gave us the information about the special allowance in designated schools. Perhaps we could have had this long ago. No financial incentive was built into the structure by the previous Tory Government. It was only our Labour Government, realising the seriousness of the position of places like Lanarkshire, who decided that something extra must be done to provide an incentive to get teachers into the grossly under-staffed schools, of which there are some in my constituency. I am glad that there is a slight improvement—the Under-Secretary did not claim more than that—but what examination has the Scottish Office given to the quota system which obtains in England? I should be the last to want direction of teachers; no one would sanction that, but, with the best will in the world, whatever the Scottish Office does, whatever financial incentives are given in designated schools, there will still be trouble in attracting teachers to the areas of grave shortage. So I should like my hon. Friends views on the quota system, which I understand works fairly well in England.<br><br>
Other matters, apart from financial incentives, would help in areas of grave shortage. In the last month or so I have been having discussions with a number of heads of secondary schools in Lanarkshire. I have been consulting the Director of Education and members of the Education Committee. Has my hon. Friend any knowledge of the other kinds of incentives which are given, say, in Glasgow, Renfrewshire and Dunbartonshire, to ensure that, particularly in our secondary schools, we first of all keep the staff we have there, and secondly, provide an attraction for new staff? My information is that, in these three education authorities, which are in close proximity to Lanarkshire, such incentives are being provided. An example is laboratory assistants. We are short of teachers in almost every science—physics, chemistry and biology—and what a help it is to the teachers of those subjects if all their time can be devoted to teaching and not to the setting up of apparatus and to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 80</span>
clerical matters.<br><br>
All that Lanarkshire secondary teachers are asking is that these facilities be provided in our Lanarkshire schools. I am not making these pleas only for Lanarkshire. I am asking that these facilities should be provided in any education authority area where there is grave shortage.<br><br>
There is also the question of more secretarial assistance. I can imagine the director of a school, the teachers and heads of departments being able to give much more of their time to invaluable administrative work, invaluable teaching and, what I consider of very great importance, getting to know their pupils and their problems individually. As things are at present, in an education authority like Lanarkshire, this is almost impossible.<br><br>
If these education authorities around Lanarkshire provide these incentives, they are, in effect, poaching teachers who are already in Lanarkshire. Every pressure should be brought to bear by the Scottish office on the Lanarkshire Education Authority and every other authority which is not doing everything possible.<br><br>
I am told by a headmaster that, in discussions with Lanarkshire, the Education Authority says that it is most willing to provide these incentives, but it has not the money. I would like the Under-Secretary of State to deal with that. It seems to me that if Glasgow, Renfrewshire and Dunbartonshire can provide them, and with the same kind of financial difficulties, there must be some very strange reason why Lanarkshire, for financial reasons, cannot provide them.<br><br>
12 noon.<br><br>
Finally, I hope the increase in the school bursaries will help us on this question of teacher shortage. Many over the years have tried to make the case that too many able pupils left school at 15 or 16 years of age, sometimes because of the attraction of the wages paid to youngsters of that age, sometimes because parents found it impossible financially to keep them at school. From our side of the House we always made the case that if school grants were raised it would be an incentive to the child and to the parents to ensure that the child stayed at school. I want to congratulate the Secretary of State and the Under-Secretary of State on the increasing of these grants. If they ensure that more of our able pupils stay at school they will
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0252">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 81</span>
provide a much bigger pool of potential manpower from which we can get for our various professions, including teaching, those people who are of great importance to the future of our country.<br><br>
I wish the greatest success to the Under-Secretary of State in all the plans he has outlined this morning. The picture is not a rosy one, but it is much better than one realised from the kind of criticism we get inside this Committee and outside in the country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I intend to devote my remarks to one matter exclusively. It is, I think, a matter which is fast approaching the dimensions of a national scandal. I refer, of course, to the situation which is continuing over registration by the General Teaching Council.<br><br>
I seem to recall that we have been regularly told that the purpose of the General Teaching Council was to enhance and is to enhance the status and to improve the quality of the teaching profession in Scotland. Yet one year after its establishment, what do we find? We find that several hundred teachers who do not have qualifications, and many of whom are very unlikely to attain qualifications, are continuing to teach in the schools. We find, on the other hand, that a score of teachers who have qualifications and years of experience behind them have already been sacked, and not only been sacked but, with a peculiar quirk of viciousness, have even been denied unemployment benefit on their sacking. We find that upwards of 2,000 fully qualified and experienced teachers are facing the threat of dismissal today.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Archie Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman refers to the vicious action of teachers being sacked and being disallowed unemployment benefit. Has he ever raised this in connection with all kinds of industrial workers who, in similar circumstances, have to wait that period of time before they qualify for unemployment benefit?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hardly think it would be in order this morning to discuss what has happened in other instances.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thomas Oswald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Answer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The position in this case is that the Government claim that the teachers dismissed themselves whereas the local authorities, the em-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 82</span>
ployers, made it absolutely clear that they were only dismissing the teachers because the Government gave them no choice and ordered them so to do. I shall revert to the way in which the Government seek to treat the local authorities as their scapegoats in a moment.<br><br>
The third thing we see a year after the establishment of the General Teaching Council is that the law has been brought into contempt. I think I am right in saying that there is not one local authority in Scotland today which is not in breach of the law and has not been in breach of the law since 1st May of this year. At the same time we have this flagrant contrast between the way one group of teachers last year or earlier this year was treated for committing a so-called crime, and another group of teachers has been treated this year although they have committed precisely the same crime.<br><br>
Finally, now we have the Government saying, in the words the Under-Secretary used this morning, that "Local authorities are obliged to see that they do not employ teachers who have not registered." Well, of course, as things stand at the present time with over 2,000 teachers having failed to reregister, if local authorities were to act literally on that tomorrow there would be some empty schools.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. A. Woodburn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making out that all this is a matter of principle. Does he not agree with his hon. Friend that it is probably much more a question of negligence and in some cases meanness—not being prepared to pay the £1—and sometimes the difficulty of collecting it, and it would be silly for the local authorities to act logically and sack 2,000 teachers, as he seems to want, merely because they failed to register in time? With due persuasion and the machinery his hon. Friend suggests the whole thing could be got over very quickly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not agree for one moment that this a question of negligence. One is not negligent for two months in a matter like this. That is absolute nonsense. I intend to refer to the constructive suggestions which my hon. Friend made.<br><br>
As I was saying when the right hon. Gentleman interrupted me, the Government have again repeated this morning that local authorities are apparently to be obliged to dismiss these teachers. I listened
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0253">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 83</span>
with interest to what my hon. Friend had to say on this matter. I am bound to tell him that I do not think this is a matter on which the Opposition can stand aside and shut their eyes. My hon. Friend said that it is a delicate matter. Yes; of course it is a delicate matter, but it is hardly a matter about which the Opposition should not have a view. If it is the view of the Opposition that the Government's action in telling local authorities to dismiss a further couple of thousand teachers is to be supported, that is an attitude which I myself cannot possible share.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend knows, I appreciate and respect his feelings on this problem and there is agreement between us on the point of equity. I chose my words this morning with care. May I suggest to him that it is right to consider very carefully the consequences of appearing to encourage any group of people which, unwittingly or not, puts itself in breach of the law?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was going to refer to that specifically. The point which, I cannot help thinking, my hon. Friend is overlooking is that the law is in breach today and has been in breach for months. We have passed a law which is being made to look a fool, and I believe we should not have passed that law, but it is no good saying merely that we should not encourage people to be in breach of the law, because if the law were enforced tomorrow the education system would collapse; therefore to argue acting within the law is rather meaningless in this context. We are told we must support the Government in their efforts to enroll the teaching community under the threat of dismissal, yet we all know that if the teachers stand firm the bluff will inevitably be called. Alternatively if, as happened last year, resistance can be reduced to numbers which this Government feel it safe to discipline we shall have further sacking of qualified teachers, which will continue next year and the year after that, till we arrive at the point which, I suppose, is the Under-Secretary's idea of heaven, where all the teachers are registered and half the schools closed. If that is what the Government want to achieve it is not a consummation which I am prepared to support or participate in.<br><br>
We are told that if we oppose the dismissal of unregistered teachers, then we
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 84</span>
are flouting the wishes of the vast majority of the teaching profession. We have had that point made by hon. Members this morning. I submit that we should examine this vast majority proposition with a little bit of care. There is no doubt at all that the professional organisers of the main teaching organisations have been very enthusiastic about getting the General Teaching Council established. I would be perfectly prepared to accept that in so doing they had the support of the large majority of their active members, but to say that the "vast majority" of teachers support the General Teaching Council because the "vast majority" of teachers have registered, knowing that if they do not register they will be sacked, is rather akin to the Inquisition's saying that everybody in Catholic Spain supported the Catholic Church—because if they did not, they were put on the rack until they did. It is a pretty strange definition of a "vast majority" to take a position of <i>force majeure</i> such as exists in this instance today.<br><br>
But suppose a majority, a large majority, a very large majority, or a vast majority of the teachers are in favour of compulsory registration, does this oblige us to ride roughshod, with the whole machinery of the law, over the views of a minority? I think the party opposite would naturally say "yes". I have always understood it to be one of their rules of faith, that a majority has always the right to impose its views on a minority, and has always a right to require the Government to enable it to do so. But I must confess that I am a little surprised to find my hon. Friend apparently endorsing this proposition, which, to my mind, is one which is entirely divergent from what I have always believed to be one of our most fundamental duties in this place—which is, to protect the rights and interests of minorities, however small.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Industrial workers?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I really do not want to give way again to the hon. Gentleman because I do not want to take up too much time. None of us knows what will happen if we allow and encourage the Government to carry on on this course which they continue to follow. It may be that resistance will once again be reduced to a number which the Government feel it safe enough to sack with impunity. That will not improve the position for a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0254">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 85</span>
further year, nor condone the offence, or the injustice. Personally, I think it is more likely that the hard core of resistance will be too much for the Government to pursue it and to harry out of the schools. Presumably then the General Teaching Council will collapse. I would not regard this as the end of the world. When I look at the consequences which have followed the establishment of the G.T.C. to date I cannot help feeling that sometimes we might be better off without it.<br><br>
12.15 p.m.<br><br>
It is high time to tell the Government to think again now. Surely, if we want to save the G.T.C. instead of traipsing along the trail of the obstinacy of the Under-Secretary and the Government we should say to them, "Think again. Withdraw the threat of the sack, reinstate the teachers who have been sacked, accept that the minority of teachers who also resent being asked to exchange professional qualifications of a lifetime for new ones must be handled in some other way.<br><br>
There was a good deal of sense in the suggestion made by my hon. Friend the Member for Galloway (Mr. Brewis) in this context, and anything we can do, so long as we eliminate this blunderbuss threat of the sack against the minority. I would be prepared to accept that there might be some incentive to registration built into the system. What I cannot accept, and what I believe this Committee is made to accept, is that we should go on encouraging resistance—because that is what it is—by waving this big stick, whose usefulness depends on the numbers against whom it can be applied.<br><br>
If this Government, like all weak Governments, find it impossible to accept the loss of face which, admittedly, would be involved in accepting the sort of suggestions advanced by my hon. Friend the Member for Galloway, then I submit that we must be careful to say that the responsibility for the collapse of the G.T.C, if it comes, will rest squarely on the shoulders of the Government, and, I think it is fair to say, on the shoulders of those among the professional organisers in the profession who have pursued the minority with such relentless vindictiveness.<br><br>
We cannot, I submit, support what the Government are about in this matter. Or, at any rate, I am bound to say that, if my hon. Friends feel able to support the Government in what they are about, I do not.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 86</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before calling the next speaker I would just draw to the Committee's attention the fact that there are, apart from the Front Bench spokesmen, only two hon. Members who wish to speak, and that if they are indulgent to each other it may be possible to call both, before calling on the Front Bench speakers. I hope the hon. Member I shall now call will bear that in mind. Mr. Dalyell.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think it would be a pity to allow this meeting to end without paying a tribute to a distinguished civil servant who used to attend our proceedings for some years, Mr. Harry Donnelly, who will be much missed, not least by the Scottish Education Department, and certainly by the University of Stirling, for which he did so much to give it a good start. I personally owed him a debt of gratitude in the matter of the British India Ship School. But for the things he did, in talking to us properly, beyond the call of his duty, the Dunera Ship School project would not have got off the ground.<br><br>
This is the time of year when many of us are invited to go to schools. Before making criticisms or suggestions we should register what is good about Scottish education, because so much is so good, as one sees especially when one has an opportunity of travelling in other advanced industrial countries. I recently had the good fortune to go to Japan and one realises there the great educational advantages which we have.<br><br>
In machine-gun rapid style, I shall raise four questions. First, nursery education. We must be clear that there will be no money from the Chancellor in order to further nursery schools or play groups. It is unrealistic to expect the Treasury to cough up so much as a penny for it at present. I think the Department could do much to help voluntary people who are qualified to run play centres, by advising them how to go about it. The Department, with its expertise, could do a useful job. To what extent is it my hon. Friend's policy to build nursery adjuncts to new primary schools? Infant school mistresses to whom I have spoken say that many pupils are immature when they arrive at primary school, particularly from high-rise houses, and this sort of entry, perhaps on a half-day basis, would be valuable.<br><br>
Secondly, playing fields. There is no time and I have no wish to repeat all that I said in the Committee Stage of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0255">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 87</span>
Education Bill. Yet, the Department should call together contractors to pool some expertise in this matter. Many of us have the impression that a good deal is being wasted in laying out bad playing fields which later prove unsatisfactory. In towns and cities, the Scottish Office could look at the land which they hold as an organisation, particularly hospital land, to see what could be used for the expansion of playing fields. Discussion should take place with the Ministry of Defence to see what can be done to have the Forces, particularly the sappers, laying them out as part of Opmac operations, following the good work I saw being done with Sir Derek Lang at places between Brodick and Kinlochewe.<br><br>
Thirdly, maths and physics teaching. I echo what my right hon. Friend the Member for Lanarkshire, North (Miss Herbison) said about mathematics and physics teachers. The report of the National Council on Education Technology gave the view that priority should be given to the development of teaching materials in mathematics and particularly the development of machines and different visual aids in schools and colleges. We can present modern methods and aids which enhance the value of teachers. I underline what my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary said when he attached so much importance to 26 teachers improving their qualifications from ordinary to honours degrees. This is obviously important in a specialist subject.<br><br>
Fourthly, could I raise, in shorthand, the issue of higher education. According to the figures that come my way, we are already, in 1969, 40,000 students ahead of the Robbins target. All this has to be paid for, and it creates a crisis in public expenditure. The Scottish Office, with Curzon Street, will have to be doing some tough talking to the Treasury. The Treasury is a hard bargainer and this is perhaps the realistic part of politics. I offer a suggestion to the S.E.D. in its talks with the Treasury—that, when it is asked for cuts, it should offer to cut the teacher-training course from three years to two years. If concessions have to be made in the explosion of higher education, it is this cut that I would wish to see offered. It should be a priority request to the Treasury that it should upgrade the pay of teachers in technical subjects and physical education. These salaries are
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 88</span>
extremely unsatisfactory, particularly at the lower age range.<br><br>
Finally, the hon. Member for Galloway (Mr. Brewis) should not come here and make statements which he cannot back up in black and white, especially as we all know that he is the accredited representative of the E.I.S. and occupies a position of some responsibility. I think he should be careful what he says, because politicians bring discredit on their profession when they become purveyors of rumours.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brewis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When I speak in this Committee I speak for myself and not for the E.I.S. I do not choose to take the course which the hon. Member took of using Parliamentary privilege of smearing Colonel Mitchell and Sir Colin Wilson of Glasgow University and not repeating the remarks outside.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Colonel Mitchell smears himself.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We cannot continue this subject. Colonel Mitchell himself substantiated what I said, by his own writing in the <i>Sunday Express</i>.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alasdair Mackenzie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I promise to be brief and also to confine myself to matters relevant to the area I represent. Education in the Highlands has always had a high priority and it is no less so today. In the changing conditions in which we live we hear a great deal about the benefits of centralisation. I am afraid that in many cases these benefits are very overrated, especially with regard to education. When we in the Highlands try to build up communities, by getting people of various skills into these areas, I inevitably find that when I am approached by people interested in going north, one of their first questions is about the educational facilities available in the area. If pupils have to leave home at the age of 11 or 12 this is a definite drawback in getting people to the areas which we and the Government are doing so much to build up at this time. We are all anxious to maintain the populations in these rural areas.<br><br>
To illustrate what I mean I would like to quote a case in my constituency. At Ullapool we have a flourishing and steadily growing community. We have a good school and an efficient staff. Under the centralisation scheme it could well happen that there might be a proposal to downgrade this school and transfer
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0256">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 89</span>
all the pupils over 12 years to Dingwall, 45 miles away. This would be very detrimental to the village and the surrounding area. It would upset parents and it would be harmful to the social life of this closely knit community. I give this instance to show what centralisation carried too far will mean and I hope the Minister will bear this in mind.<br><br>
The raising of the school leaving age is important and it will cost a great deal of money from Exchequer funds and local rates. Transport costs in an area where pupils have to travel long distances will be considerably increased when the school leaving age is raised. The big question is, will we get an adequate return for the money we use in this way? This will depend chiefly on the subjects taught in this extra year. I am sure that there will be many reluctant pupils, and there are various reasons for this. At the moment a boy who leaves school at 15 gets a very good wage indeed. This wage is a real disincentive to carrying on at school and it will be the same after we raise the school leaving age. It is to be hoped that those responsible for providing the facilities after the school leaving age is raised will ensure that pupils can benefit in later life by the tuition provided during this extra year. It will be necessary to have a wide range of subjects to suit the aptitudes and abilities of these pupils. I hope that this will be borne in mind.<br><br>
12.30 p.m.<br><br>
I am very pleased to hear from the Minister that there has been such good progress in the building of senior secondary schools to meet the changed conditions, and I think that this is true of the Highlands as elsewhere. We are coming to a very important stage with regard to the future of education, and I stress again to the Minister that, as far as I can judge, the main thing to do is to provide the sort of education in this extra year which will suit the abilities and aptitudes of the pupils for after life.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Esmond Wright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I begin by associating myself with two of the remarks of the hon. Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell). I am sure that I speak for all Members of the Committee when I salute the work of Harry Donnelly, not only in the Scottish Education Department, but as one of the real founders of the new University of Stirling. I also
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 90</span>
endorse what the hon. Gentleman said about the quality of Scottish education.<br><br>
I speak with some temerity, in that next to the hon. Lady the Member for Hamilton (Mrs. Ewing) I am the most junior Member of this Committee in terms of length of membership. As I listened to the debate, it struck me as a rather strange commentary on the organisation of this peculiar place that this is the only occasion—two and a half hours per year—that we have to discuss the broad trends of policy and administration of the Scottish Education Department.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman aware that this is entirely a matter for the Opposition? They could have a whole day in the House if they chose.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Even if we had a day, or two days, the point that I am making remains one of substance. We have spent a lot of time this year discussing education. That is not in question. Indeed, I am sure that the Minister will have "education" written firmly on his heart, if I may adopt a phrase of the sixteenth century. I recall that last night the hon. Gentleman was asked whether some Members of the Government had hearts, and whether some had minds, and whether some had both those organs. I am assuming that the hon. Gentleman has a heart, and it is this assumption to which I shall return. The point is whether this is the best way in which the House of Commons should be organised.<br><br>
Every speech this morning has hinted at the problem of selection. I congratulate all hon. Members, though there were many moments when I thought it was not going to be true, for keeping to the point, since the theme which my hon. Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) suggested at the outset has been followed right through, the theme of teachers, their work, their status, their numbers, and the schools in which they teach.<br><br>
It is striking, if we look at what is, after all, our nominal subject for debate this morning, the Estimates for this year, to find that we are spending £35 million a year on this head alone, and this is only one aspect of the Scottish Education budget. I go so far as to say that the Minister should be congratulated on some aspects of this expenditure, though with some qualifications, to which I shall come later.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0257">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 91</span>
I congratulate him on the fact that £1 million extra is being spent this year on teacher-training. I congratulate him on the fact that £1 million extra is going on awards to students. I doubt whether I can congratulate the Minister on the fact that £200,000 extra is going on administration, and perhaps when he replies to the debate he will clarify what that mysterious and ambiguous word covers.<br><br>
It is a matter [for congratulation—and here I am reinforcing what was said by the hon. Member for West Lothian—that there is a good deal that is creditable in the content of Scottish education, which I think is evidenced in the 1968 Report which has been mentioned.<br><br>
I want to pool my remarks into the form of looking at four aspects of the teachers and their numbers. First, status; second the supply of them; third, the subjects they teach; and fourth, the schools in which they teach.<br><br>
I begin, because it has been the preoccupation of the Committee, with status. I agree with everything that was said by my hon. Friend about the róle of the General Teaching Council. I support the notion of the establishment of a professional body which will look after the interests of the profession. Indeed, I think that the time has come to stop using the phrase, "if the G.T.C. comes". My hon. Friend the Member for South Angus (Mr. Bruce-Gardyne) feels passionately on this subject, and with some of his concern I shall identify myself in a moment. My hon. Friend used the phrase, "collapse of the G.T.C. if it comes". We must all ensure that a professional body, which was requested by all the professional teachers' Associations in Scotland, is established, and deplore that it has taken this peculiar cliff-hanging series of operations before it has come into being. I do not want in any way to prejudge what is now an issue of review, the composition of the G.T.C, though I thought that the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Galloway (Mr. Brewis) was extremely constructive and helpful.<br><br>
If I may, for a moment, cast a glance backwards, I differ from the right hon. Member for East Stirlingshire (Mr. Wood-burn) when he questions whether these 21 who were dismissed from the schools were dismissed because of issues of principle, and thinks that perhaps some of them were neglectful. I realise that the right hon.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 92</span>
Gentleman was reiterating one of my hon. Friends. I believe that the disturbing feature of this—and I am sure that this is very much in the Minister's mind—is that these 21 who were dismissed were people of outstanding principle. Indeed, this is part of their place in the history of this whole problem.<br><br>
What worries me still more is that it seems we have, inadvertently I am sure, sent 13 of them to reinforce the teacher supply situation in Sudbury, Ontario. I am referring to one prominent teacher who taught for a long time in Aberdeen, but who is moving there and taking others with him. I do not want to quote the statement which makes it plain that the lady who was dismissed after thirty years as a teacher in the English department in Glasgow is also a lady of principle.<br><br>
On this issue, I identify myself with the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for South Angus, who is properly raising questions of equity and principle—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. J. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman please tell me now what is his and the Opposition's point of view about the G.T.C.? Is it that expressed by the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur), or that expressed by the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Bruce-Gardyne)?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I had made my position plain. I said that, looking back, we find 21 people who are out of a job for reasons of conviction on their part. I deplore that this has happened, not merely because the schools are short of their qualifications, but that this should have arisen at all as a result of action taken in this place, and legislation which we passed. I was saying that this was a backward glance. I am now saying that it is imperative that hon. Members on both sides should do their best to see that a professional body is established which will marry the two notions—and this is the dilemma—of public responsibility and recognition of professional status. This is the core of it all.<br><br>
I reinforce some of the remarks which have been made that it would be wrong for a body to be set up which is composed exclusively of teachers, but equally there are overwhelming indications from all the professional Associations that there ought to be a high teacher component on this Council. I do not think that it would be proper for me to spell out how the body
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0258">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 93</span>
should be composed, but I should like to know from the Minister where he is in the relationship with the Associations, whether he has had time to study the memoranda which have been submitted, and what his views are on the difficult problem of marrying professionalism and public responsibility.<br><br>
Again, to reinforce what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Galloway, I think that we could have had a system whereby perhaps the local authority carried out an automatic registration. Looking back, I think that we could have had a system whereby those who were certificated and had long years of experience in the schools were deemed to be registered. I cannot for a moment believe that it was the mere matter of the payment of £1 which did this, and I should appreciate the Minister's view on the matter.<br><br>
I also reinforce what, I think, was running through the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for South Angus, namely, this question of redundancy. I feel that we have treated these 21 people harshly. I think that there could have been opportunities to indicate that perhaps this action had to be taken in law, but it was a sad blow for Scottish education and for the principles for which they stood.<br><br>
I should like the Minister to ask where he is in his discussions, particularly with Lanarkshire—because Lanarkshire was mentioned by the right hon. Lady the Member for Lanarkshire, North (Miss Herbison)—about the work of these registration panels. There has been some considerable discussion, and I endorse what the right hon. Lady said about the need for ancillary help in the schools, but there is a real danger that by the use of laboratory assistants, secretaries, technicians, or whatever word one uses, one begins a process of dilution, and it is this that worries the professional Associations. I do not want to develop this, except to ask the Minister to clarify Table B on page 42 of the Report, which describes some of the numbers engaged in helping in local authority schools. It seems that it covers a whole multitude of headings under three distinct categories.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Herbison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The need for laboratory assistants and technicians is supported by the teachers in Scotland. What I suggested is very far from the kind of dilution that perhaps is taking place in one local authority in Scotland.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 94</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What I am seeking to do is to emphasise that one step in any particular testing situation leads to the other, and there is real concern over dilution.<br><br>
I move now to the issue of staffing. I accept what the Minister said about the striking improvement in the supply of primary teachers in Scotland. I wonder, however, whether he can give us some more information, because there is beginning to develop in Scotland a certain concern, matching the concern in England, about the situation in which there could be a striking over-supply of primary teachers. The figures given by the Minister yesterday in a Written Answer suggest that by 1974–75 there will be a surplus of about 5,000 teachers in the primary schools.<br><br>
If that arises, perhaps the Minister will answer two questions. He says that the figures for wastage rose strikingly in the last two years. Why is it that an awareness of the impact of wastage is so recent a phenomenon in the Scottish Education Department? The wastage, particularly of women teachers, has been a striking feature of the last two decades. But more than that, can the Minister assure us, and there were moments in his speech when I became rather puzzled at one or two of the implications of domestic science, that there will not be a use of some of these ultimately 5,000 surplus primary teachers in the secondary schools? As his figures of yesterday suggest, there will be an acute shortage from 1972 onwards of nearly 3,000 in the first year, with the raising of the school leaving age. I hope that there is not an indirect assumption that some of these very gifted primary school teachers could go on and teach at the secondary level.<br><br>
12.45 p.m.<br><br>
The Minister indirectly conceded the point that in terms of staffing even at primary school level there is still an acute shortage in particular areas, not least in Glasgow. Of about 7,000 children in Scotland who are getting part-time education, no less than 55 per cent. are in the Glasgow area. Particular schools have been hurt by this, and I ask for as much assistance as possible from the Government.<br><br>
Staffing is especially difficult in the secondary schools. There is little time for me to question the Minister on Circular 714, but he is, of course, aware that the professional Associations are very worried
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0259">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 95</span>
about a form of direction of teacher supply. Every Association has made protests on this head, and it is important that the Minister should make a clear statement that there is no danger of direction of labour in education.<br><br>
The shortage of teachers particularly affects mathematics. It even affects Aberdeen, which is well off in many ways in comparison with other parts of Scotland. It affects commercial subjects, physics, chemistry and biology in Aberdeen, so even privileged Aberdeen is in this matter no better off than the rest of the country.<br><br>
More could be done to clarify the position of graduates in schools. The Minister spoke of the success of persuading more graduates into school teaching. The hon. Member for Midlothian (Mr. Eadie) said that more use should be made of women, but there is still an ambiguity in Scotland about this, particularly in respect of the wives of university staffs in the big cities who have teaching qualifications obtained in England and who believe, rightly or wrongly, that they are unable to teach in Scotland. To be personal, my wife has a First in History, she has a teaching diploma, and she taught in the Lake District in the war years, yet she could not teach in a Glasgow school because she was not at Jordanhill. I salute the quality of Jordanhill; it is an admirable place; but there is a need to make it plain to people in Scotland, particularly women, that there is no barrier to their employment as teachers even though their qualifications have been obtained furth of Scotland. The Minister made reference to the B.Ed. qualification, and I agree with what he said.<br><br>
It is perhaps the special schools which suffer most acutely from the shortage of teachers. I am worried about what will be the position in five to ten years' time. Some 75 per cent. of those teachers are now over the age of 45 and there is a need to begin the process of recruitment very much earlier than obtains at present.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the limited time available it will not be possible for me to answer all the points which have been raised, but I will at least try to answer a considerable number of them, in the same order as I used in my opening remarks.<br><br>
Little has been said, certainly by hon. Gentlemen opposite, about building, because the figure is extremely good. It is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 96</span>
true that the figures of places in projects completed are not as good as the figures for approvals, starts and under construction. I have never disguised the fact that that is so. The completion figures reflect the starts figures of two or three years ago, and these were, admittedly, nothing like as high as they are now. From the table which gives the completion figures on page 133 of "Scottish Educational Statistics", it can be seen that in 1968 the number of places provided in projects completed was 47,000, in projects approved for the same year the number of places was 84,000, in projects started the number of places was 84,000, and for projects under construction at the end of the year the figure was 99,000. The figures for starts will have their effect in the years 1969, 1970 and 1971, which are the years when the additional places will be needed to meet the raising of the school leaving age in 1972. I have no time to give more figures, but if hon. Gentlemen will refer to that table they will see that the preponderance of approvals is for secondary schools, so that the figures for secondary departments, which cost a great deal more per place than primary schools, will show a considerable improvement in the next two years. It is probably true to say that, with one exception, the Committee is in support of the principle of the G.T.C. and the way in which it has operated. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Wright) always finds it extremely uncomfortable to come down off the fence on this, or indeed on anything else—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not fair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Hannan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not unfair. It is absolutely right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: —but I take it that he is more or less in favour of the G.T.C. The hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) made a number of suggestions how the Council might be improved, particularly on the re-registration point, and the hon. Member for Galloway (Mr. Brewis) made similar suggestions.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman will appreciate that I am not this morning able to say what I feel about any of these propositions. At this stage of the review, when we have just received representations from the various bodies concerned, it would be quite improper for me to give any final view on any of these points. All I can say
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0260">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 97</span>
is that these points are all relevant to the review. In addition to considering the written evidence, before the review is completed there will have to be meetings with the principal bodies concerned to talk over some of the problems mentioned by hon. Gentlemen.<br><br>
I may add that any question of automatic registration, involving automatic deduction of the registration fee from the salary of the teacher, would almost certainly require legislation. There is nothing in existing legislation to allow such an automatic deduction from a teacher's salary, and this raises important implications for the status of professional councils generally. This matter will be taken up in the review.<br><br>
I feel a certain satisfaction in that no hon. Member has seriously questioned, or perhaps questioned at all, the assessment of the situation in the primary schools which I made in my opening remarks. It is accepted by all that the situation is improving and will continue to improve. One must not draw too hasty conclusions from the figures which were produced demonstrating that there will be a "surplus" in a few years' time. The improving standards will mean that an additional number of teachers will be required to get rid of the oversize classes. Secondly, if, having improved the standard, there were a considerable surplus, or likely to be, of primary teachers, we would have to do something about the recruitment of girls into colleges for primary teacher-training. We are not in that position yet, although I want to encourage more girls with appropriate qualifications to go in for secondary teaching. We are not likely to reach a situation in which there are large numbers of primary teachers available with no jobs to go to, and we could not allow that situation to be reached. There is much still to be done in improving standards before that situation could arise.<br><br>
There was a general welcome for the approach of the memorandum on staffing in secondary schools, although I appreciate that particular details of the memorandum and particular assumptions on which calculations have been based may be subject to query, or perhaps criticism. This was done in as realistic a way as possible, and with no intention of starting off with preconceived notions that there was not a shortage of staff in secondary schools and that if we adjusted the statis-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 98</span>
tics the shortage could be eliminated on paper. That would be absurd, and was not the approach of the memorandum. The E.I.S., while it reserves its position on the Circular has essentially welcomed the approach of the memorandum as giving far more systematic and coherent information about secondary staffing than ever before.<br><br>
We shall be pursuing the particular point in the Circular which we asked authorities to look at when we get their reactions to the Circular and to the memorandum.<br><br>
Several hon. Members have raised points about improving the attractiveness of teaching to the entrants to the profession. I agree with many of the remarks which were made, although the suggestion of the hon. Member for Galloway about encouraging clubs for young teachers and paying subscriptions and so on was turned down by the Roberts Committee as being of possibly limited value. It is important that authorities should give a real welcome to new teachers entering their service. I would like to think that the authorities with the greatest shortage were the most welcoming to young teachers and made them feel accepted, but, unfortunately, this is not so. Some authorities with no staffing problems take a great deal of trouble in welcoming teachers to their area, and provide extremely good facilities for them. Some authorities with bad staffing problems are not as good as this, and that is an appalling situation.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend mentioned the provision of laboratory assistants in secondary schools. Lanarkshire has said that it wants to do this in principle but is inhibited by financial considerations. There are at present 129 laboratory assistants in Glasgow schools. There are no laboratory assistants in Lanarkshire schools. That tells its own story. Were the authority able to recruit the teachers it needs, that itself would impose a financial burden on it, and an authority in this situation with a considerable teaching shortage should be improving the status of its teachers in every possible way, with laboratory assistants, secretarial assistants, and so on. I hope very much that this will happen in Lanarkshire.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) mentioned nursery education. He will be aware that under the urban aid programme something is now being done—admittedly, a limited amount—to provide more places for nursery
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0261">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 99</span>
education. I recently gave figures to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollok, which showed that, even before the programme started, there had been a considerable improvement in Glasgow in the last four years, although the figures are still very small in relation to the need. I am anxious that this provision should be improved, but it involves difficult questions of priority, and neither our predecessors nor the present Government have felt able to give the priority to nursery education which in other circumstances they would have liked to give. Developments are now taking place, and the provision is improving slightly. A number of studies have
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 100</span>
been progressing, in co-operation with individual authorities, on the best kind of accommodation to be provided, how it can be provided and the most economical provision, so that when we are able to go ahead more rapidly, we shall be in a position to do so. We should all like to see this happening when the opportunity arises. This is very much a question of priorities, but I think that—</span></p>
