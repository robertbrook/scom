	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Dr. J. Dickson Mabon)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) moved Amendment No. 51 at our last sitting. I should like to reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am very grateful to the hon. Gentleman for making it plain that this is not a general attack on Treasury control and for limiting his argument in this context to the method of fixing the interest rate as being unduly cumbersome. I believe that the Corporation of Glasgow has made a number of submissions and that, in particular, this is a proposal which they suggest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the hon. Gentleman's point that the money which is being recovered here is local authority expenditure and that there is no specific grant payable on that expenditure. There is, therefore, no financial interest for the central Government in the way in which recovery is effected. The reference to the Treasury in the Bill follows the wording of Section 12(3) of the 1966 Act which we are replacing. I have considered this point, and I agree that it is not essential to use these words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment as drafted would leave the fixing of the interest rate with the Secretary of State. That could be justified on the argument that it was desirable that the rate should be fixed
	<span class='label label-info column'>208</span>
by someone who did not have a direct financial interest, but it might be simpler to allow—as Glasgow Corporation perhaps intended—the local authority to fix the rate itself, subject perhaps to a power for the Secretary of State to prescribe a maximum. There is a precedent for such an arrangement in Section 56(3) of the Water (Scotland) Act, 1946—although no order by the Secretary of State has ever been made under that act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman withdraws his Amendment, I shall be inclined to consider what is the best course and to put down a suitable Government Amendment on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister of State for considering this Amendment, which he realises we put forward constructively in the hope of improving this Clause. Certainly we did not regard the Amendment as necessarily ideal in itself. I am grateful to him that he looks at it in the way he explained. In these circumstances, in view of the assurance that he will look at this matter between now and Report, I am prepared to withdraw the Amendment. I shall look forward to seeing which way he deals with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Personally, I agree with him that this should not be left entirely to the discretion of the local authority. There ought to be this final control by the Secretary of State, which is not quite so cumbersome as full reference to the Treasury, which is what I have tried to delete by my Amendment. But the Secretary of State should have some control over it, and something like the hon. Member suggested on the lines of the Water (Scotland) Act might be a sensible way of doing it. As he is prepared to look at this matter between now and Report, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to raise one or two general points on the Clause, and fairly quickly, too. I should like to ask the Minister of State exactly how he sees the Clause working in practice. While one accepts the procedure in the Clause for local authorities recovering, by charging order, expenses incurred by them on behalf of someone else, so
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1259">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>209</span>
that legally the situation is straightforward, in practice, as I am sure is borne out by hon. Members opposite who have had experience of it, one cannot necessarily or easily trace the person against whom one is trying to make the charging order. While I can see very litle else that can be done in the Clause, there is a slight concern, particularly in parts of Glasgow, that occasionally there will be difficulty in pursuing the procedure in certain circumstances. It is a small point. I cannot suggest anything better, but I should be interested to hear the Minister of State's view on how effective he feels it will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point which I should like to make is straightforward. Another matter raised with us is whether, in relation to this Clause, the limited liability which is given to a factor or an agent under Section 14 of the Housing (Repairs and Rents) (Scotland) Act, 1954, applies to this Clause and this procedure. That is quite important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer to the second part of the hon. Gentleman's question is, "Yes, it does apply". On the first part, I agree with him that a charging order is an instrument of last resort. We have charging orders, as he knows, under the 1966 Act, and also under the Building (Scotland) Act, 1959, but we have not witnessed charging orders being used very much. Fortunately, we have been able to use the other courses of action which are prescribed in subsection (1) and thereafter. The normal methods of recovery of a debt are available to the authority. But, of course, the demand, however it is made initially, must be a formal demand and it must be properly executed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</section>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 27</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>RECOVERY BY LESSEE OF PROPORTION OF EXPENSES INCURRED IN REPAIRING HOUSE</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Steel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 100, in page 18, line 22, leave out 'seven' and insert 'twenty-eight'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>210</span>
Clause 27 provide recourse to the sheriff in the case in which a tenant has incurred expenditure which he thinks he might recover from his landlord. My Amendment is concerned with the fact that this is possible only provided that, within seven days of receiving statutory notice requiring improvements, the tenant informs the landlord. I have put this down as a probing Amendment, because I feel that seven days is rather a short period. If he fails to take this action within seven days, his legal right under the Clause would be forfeit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To be honest, I have had second thoughts about my Amendment since I put it down some weeks ago. I think that 28 days is probably far too long. Since, in Clause 25, the minimum period laid down which may be specified in a statutory notice, giving a person a reasonable time to execute works, is 21 days, it may be that 21 days would be an ideal limit. I simply put the Amendment down because I feel that seven days is too short a time after which a person may be deprived of his legal rights under the Clause and I should like to hear the Minister's reaction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Clark Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rather agree with the hon. Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles (Mr. David Steel). Could the Minister tell me what is the usual period which we have had for similar procedure in other Bills. My recollection is that it is generally 28 days. If that is so, we should follow these precedents and allow that time. It seems to me that seven days is very short.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The origin of the period of seven days is Section 7 of the Housing (Repairs and Rents) (Scotland) Act, 1954, which we consolidated in Section 13(1) of the Housing (Scotland) Act, 1966. That is why we have chosen seven days. I am grateful for what the hon. Member for Roxbourgh, Selkirk and Peebles (Mr. David Steel) said about thinking it over again. If he works it out, given that under Clause 25 the repair notice may require the work to be executed within 21 days, it follows logically that the period in which the lessee gives notice to the lessor should be less than 21 days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that there is a choice within that range. We have not had much experience, frankly, of this, but any
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1260">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>211</span>
experience we have justifies the belief that seven days is reasonable. But I am quite prepared to look at it again, if the hon. Member will agree with me that it must be less than twenty-one days, which means that it would probably be a choice of either, seven days or fourteen days. I do not know how the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) feels about that, but if I give an undertaking to look at this in the light of the short statements which we have had from both hon. Members, perhaps that would content the hon. Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles. I do not wish to hold out a definite hope that I shall put down an Amendment on Report for, as I suggest, it is a very narrow point; the period must be either seven or fourteen days, as I see it, and I suppose it is a matter of judgment which is right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has been very reasonable about this matter. I agree that, on second thoughts, the period ought to be less than the twenty-one days. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. J. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we leave this Clause, I hope that the Minister of State will give us a little enlightenment on one particular aspect of it, and that is subsection (1)(c):
	<br><blockquote><p>"to the rent payable under the lease".</p></blockquote>
In my constituency there are still a substantial number of small landlords receiving rents down to £4 per annum which, as I think the Minister of State would agree, would not cover the half of the daily wage for a small team of workmen brought in to do a very small repair. It seems to me that, under these circumstances, and indeed up to several times that level of rent, it is quite inequitable that additional financial burdens should be imposed on the landlord under this Clause. I do not see how the type of landlord of whom I am talking could possibly be expected to meet expenses even running into £30, £40 or £50, because that far exceeds any expectation of rent he may have from the property for several years. As many of these people are retired, elderly folk, they have not funds to pour in and they
	<span class='label label-info column'>212</span>
simply cannot meet this sort of expendtiure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should, therefore, very much like to know how the Minister of State reckons that that reference should be interpreted where there is an appeal to the sheriff. If there is a very low rent under a controlled tenancy, should that be an overriding case for rejection of an appeal by a lessee, or is that merely one of the factors which is to be taken into account, and perhaps rather a subsidiary factor at that? If it is, I think that considerable injustice could be done by the Clause, certainly in my constituency and, I suspect, in some other constituencies, where the level of controlled rents is grotesquely low. I hope that the Minister of State, before we leave the Clause, will give us some enlightenment upon this point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the problem put by the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Bruce-Gardyne). He has been in correspondence with me about this in another context. From what I gather from correspondence covering most of Scotland, it seems to me that the situation which he describes is more common in his constituency and perhaps in other parts of the north-east of Scotland than it is in other areas. Nevertheless, I sympathise with landlords owning few properties which produce such a small amount of rent and which, therefore, present problems when it comes to the question of substantial repairs, arrangements for which are dealt with in the Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman knows that, under Clause 26(2), we allow the local authority to recover the cost from the owner by instalments over a period which may be as long as 30 years. That is a very substantial assistance in spreading the cost.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With interest?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, with interest. It is either that, or we depart from the principle that an owner is responsible for the upkeep of his property. That is the point one has to face. It seems to me a legitimate point to make when we are discussing the question of repairs to houses in the context of Part II that it is in the owner's interests, surely, that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1261">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>213</span>
these houses are repaired. After all, we are discussing houses in serious disrepair as well as houses in disrepair. It cannot be against the owner's interests for the repairs to be carried out. It may be beyond his immediate means to settle the bills all at once with the small rents which he is receiving. Therefore the repayment can be over a period of as long as 30 years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the Minister sees the full nature of the problem. He says that it is in the owner's interest to maintain his house in good repair. I can assure him that many of these owners would be delighted to get shot of the property if they possibly could. A rent of £4 a year is of no value to them at all. They cannot afford to maintain the house. They want to get rid of it, but they cannot do so. That is the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot deal with all the problems which are involved here by offering immediate solutions. If it is the case that these people want to sell the properties and that they are prepared to accept a peppercorn award, then they should offer them to the local authority—not that the local authority is obliged to accept them. But if they fall into serious' disrepair, then of course the houses become useless and are knocked down. They are declared by a sanitary inspector to be unfit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not see how the hon. Gentleman can ask me to do things which other Ministers and other Governments have not been willing to do. What we cannot do is to breach the fundamental principle that an owner of property is responsible for the upkeep of his property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we have done in subsection (2) is to accept that there is such a situation. After all, the Rent Act, 1965, is meant—it is built into the Act—to take over ultimately the whole housing stock in the private sector as soon as we can deal with it. The Conservative Party had a long time in office in which to do this. They decontrolled a number of properties in the 1957 Act, registered no rents and simply let things go. Then they hesitated about decontrolling any more. I will not go over that again, but I think that the Rent Act, 1965, has turned out to be a
	<span class='label label-info column'>214</span>
more acceptable housing Measure to both landlord and tenant than any Measure we have had before. I hope that both parties will maintain that policy and will seek gradually to extend the rent regulation system which allows a review of rents to take place every three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's grievance is not that the present Government have frozen rents for their term of office, but that the present Government, and the last Government, and Governments before that, froze the rents of these properties. That is his grievance. The grievance is not against the Labour Party; it is against his own party and all others who joined in this general acceptance that rents should be frozen. I do not think that it is fair to start a big argument about it now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the point that it is a heavy burden on landlords with a few properties which give them very small rents. That is why subsection (2) is written as it is. No doubt we shall debate this point in another context later. All I would say to the hon. Gentleman is that we cannot depart from the fundamental principle—and I am sure that landlords, on reflection, would realise that it would be very dangerous for them if we did. We cannot do that in this Bill and therefore we have drafted Clauses 25, 26 and 27 and the other Clauses of Part II in this way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to delay the Committee, but I do not think that the Minister of State answered the point on which I wanted elucidation. The specific point on which I wanted elucidation was how, precisely, these words in paragraph—
	<br><blockquote><p>"to the rent payable under the lease;".</p></blockquote>
—are to be interpreted. What guidance is the Sheriff to have in interpreting this paragraph? It is not good enough for the Minister of State to say that the unfortunate landlords of the type to which I have referred have been in this predicament from Government to Government for many years. What he overlooks is that possibly new injustices are being imposed upon them under the wording of Part II of this Bill in that they may have imposed upon them expensive repairs by the local authority, which the local authority will carry out if they cannot afford to do it, and they may then receive under Clause 27 a claim from the lessee, who has been paying a ludicrous
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1262">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>215</span>
peppercorn rent for years, and will be forced to meet that, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I am seeking from the Minister of State, and what I have not yet had, is an explanation of the extent to which the Sheriff, in dealing with appeals under the Clause, is expected to take overriding account of the rent which is paid. Of course, if the rent is a reasonable rent by modern standards—if it is even, say, £40 or £50 a year—it might be reasonable that the money should be recovered from the lessor, but if the rent is £4 or £10 or £12 or £20 a year, as it is time and time again in my constituency, it is not reasonable. I put it to the Minister of State that impositions should not be put on landlords in this situation for maintenance of their houses, which, as I say, they are simply not in a financial position to undertake. I am asking the Minister to make a statement which can be seen as guidance to the courts in dealing with appeals under this Clause—a statement which may impress upon the courts the importance of giving very high priority to the level of rents which the landlord is receiving when appeals of this nature come before the Sheriff.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman rather surprises me, because there is nothing which obliges the sheriff or any other officer of the law to look at the HANSARD proceedings on a Bill. The sheriff is obliged to look at Statute as it is and to interpret it as he thinks correct. There is nothing that I can say that obliges any sheriff to follow what I think is right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman asks me what I think is right, I would say that the sheriff would have to pay attention to all the circumstances, and certainly to the circumstances which he mentioned. If it is clearly absurd for the sheriff to rule that the owner should bear a very heavy proportion of this cost, then he will no doubt adjudicate accordingly. After all, we are not laying down how he must adjudicate; we are not even specifying, say, the three obvious circumstances, which are not only the size of the rent but also how long the lease has to run, or whether there are conditions of rent, such as obligations on either party in respect of repairs. All these have to be taken into account. But there may be other factors, too, and we should be very
	<span class='label label-info column'>216</span>
foolish in a Bill such as this to attempt to spell them out, because we might miss some, and in that case the sheriff would be circumscribed by our attempt to name them all. It is better for us to leave it wide open for him to take into account any circumstances which he considers pertinent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman's illustration is taken to the extreme—that is, that the landlord has no resources to meet the expenditure incurred by the tenant in following out local authority instructions or in some other way—then of course the sheriff must have regard to that. But the fact that I am saying this does not mean that the sheriff would necessarily do exactly what the hon. Gentleman wants or thinks ought to be done. I cannot guarantee that. All that he and I can ask is, are the words of the Statute phrased in such a way as to exclude the possibility which he raised? The hon. Gentleman must answer for himself, and if he thinks that other words should be inserted in order to provide against that, then he must propose them. But as far as I am concerned, the words as they stand seem to me to cover the situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Subsection (1) empowers
	<br><blockquote><p>"any person authorised by a local authority or by the Secretary of State"</p></blockquote>
to enter a house or a building of which the house forms part with a view to ascertaining whether the repairs required to be executed by a notice served by the local authority under Clause 25 have in fact been carried out. The second Amendment is consequential upon the first.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 144, in page 19, line 24, leave out '24 hours'' and insert 'seven days''.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reading this Clause, I was a little concerned by the wording of subsection (2):
	<br><blockquote><p>"Any person so authorised shall give 24 hours' notice of his intention to enter any house or building to the occupier thereof and to the owner, if the owner is known."</p></blockquote>
I hope that the Minister of State will explain why the period of notice should be limited to 24 hours. It seems to me that this may be rough on the occupant, and still more on the owner if the owner is not the occupier. In the case of the occupier presumably the authorised persons could not obtain entrance if, for instance, the occupier were away on holiday, for example, and therefore the notice would not be effective. Presumably the house would be shut up so that the authorised person could not get into it after 24 hours in any case. But in the case of the owner, unless some adequate period of notice is given, it may well be that the owner has no means of knowing that the inspection is taking place. I suggest that he should know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that even if we provided for seven days' notice it would not necessarily follow that the owner was informed in advance. But the chances of that being the case would be much enhanced. It seems to me that a seven-day period of notice, on the face of it, would be more reasonable both for the occupier and for the owner. The Minister of State may have powerful arguments why that should not be so, but unless he has such powerful arguments, it seems to me that a longer period of notice is desirable in a case of this kind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>218</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The powerful arguments which I have against this Amendment are, first, that this provision has been in existence since 1925–44 years—and has been applied quite successfully in different Statutes for all that time; secondly, that we have had no representations whatsoever from anyone that this is an unfair proposition; and thirdly, that it has been quite successful in practice, that it is a very practical method and that inspection usually takes only a few minutes, as the Sanitary Inspectors' Association would confirm. It is usually arranged in an amicable way. I can recall only a few instances in which that has not been so. The point is the obligation is on the sanitary department or whoever is carrying out the inspection to give 24 hours of it. The authorities cannot simply knock on any door and ask for entry at once. They must give 24 hours notice. In fact, in many cases, simply knocking on the door is enough. The housewife usually is anxious to have the repair done and is only too pleased to allow that inspection to take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see no reason why we should extend this period to seven days; it seems an unnecessary change. The hon. Member said that the owner might not be there. Of course, the owner might be in the Bahamas, on holiday for six months, on these fabulous rents which are charged—not in Angus of course—for these properties. In that case, one would have to extend the notice from 24 hours to three months or six months, which would be absurd.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where a provision in the Statute has not been the cause of complaint from any party and where it has been in operation for nearly half a century, it is surely unwise to change it. It is far better to stick to what has been proven in practice than to attempt a departure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not very impressed by the Minister of State's argument. The argument that a practice is satisfactory because it has been observed for 45 years is very feeble, particularly from hon. Members who used to like to call themselves a reforming Government. The argument that the Minister has had no representations on this point falls down; after all, what have I been doing? What does he think I have been doing this morning but make a representation on this point?

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1264">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>219</span>
I do not want to introduce a note of controversy, but I think that the Minister of State should be a little careful in what he says in the Committee, the proceedings of which are widely reported. I can assure him that it will cause considerable resentment in my constituency for the landlords about whom I have been talking to be told that they might be away in the Bahamas, on holiday. Such landlords as I am talking about are in no position to do other than try desperately to find ways and means of protecting what remains of their savings and to sustain an ownership of property of which they long to dispose. I realise that the remark was made lightheartedly, but the Minister of State should be careful how he makes lighthearted remarks on a subject of this kind, about which bitter resentment is caused in my constituency. He must know that from the correspondence which we have exchanged on this matter. I do not want to say more on this matter, but he should be careful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am prepared to accept that the procedure in respect of the 24 hours' notice has worked reasonably well in the past. I think that the Government should recognise that the new procedures are liable to be more onerous under Part II of the Bill, certainly on the landlords, and therefore every consideration should be given to the landlord. Nevertheless, I am prepared to withdraw the Amendment on the understanding, I hope, that the situation will be watched and that, if it became apparent in the workings of the Act that a longer period of notice was desirable, the Government or their successor would take urgent action to provide such a longer period of notice. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Clark Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that this is the right place to raise the matter or whether I should wait for the debate on Clause stand part but I wish to seek information. I want to know what exactly is meant by a "local Act", and what the Minister has in mind with this Amendment. What sort of legislation will be amended? Is this the right way to do it? Should we not have an Act of Parliament if we are to do any substantial amending?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Both Edinburgh and Glasgow have local Act powers relating to the repair of houses. It is not our intention to interfere with either of these. There may be other local Act powers which will no longer be appropriate in the light of the provisions of the Bill. What we are doing here is to vary local legislation in order to make it consistent with what we are trying to achieve throughout the whole of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other words, if Edinburgh has an Act stronger than the general provision, then the strength of its local Act will remain. If Glasgow, on the other hand, has a weaker Act, then it will be made stronger by this provision. Others, which have no provisions of this kind, will be brought up to the national minimum. This is what the Clause does. It does not detract from the stronger power in any other local provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clark Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister, but I wonder whether we are doing it the right way round. Is the answer not to amend the local Act to bring it into line? Secondly, is this the right procedure in any event to amend Acts of Parliament? Should it not be done by another Act of Parliament?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have the power to vary local Orders or Acts in accordance with national requirements. An example is the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act, 1960. We had some
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1265">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>221</span>
discussion about that when we discussed the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Bill. In that we have a provision which allows us to vary local Acts as long as they are varied in a principal Statute, of which this is undoubtedly one. That would be a precedent for this kind of activity. The hon. Member asks, is this the right place so to do? The answer is "Yes".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have also been advised of another precedent for what we are doing—Section 30 of the Building (Scotland) Act, 1959. If we wish to vary Orders or Acts of a local character we can do so through that Section in order to bring about what is, in effect, a national standard. I agree that this would be taking over these powers, but this is the right way of doing it and I have no reason to believe from Edinburgh that they are in any way distressed about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) raised a point of substance about what exactly it is necessary to do about other local Acts. The Minister of State has given an assurance, which is obviously the assurance which the Committee wants, that these powers will be used under this Clause only to strengthen any local Act up to the standards within this Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But it would be helpful if the Minister were rather more specific. He mentioned that the Edinburgh local Acts were probably adequate to cope with these provisions. He said that in Glasgow they were not entirely adequate, as the experience of the storm damage a year ago proved, and that it was necessary to make them stronger. We accept those two cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be rather interested to hear from the Minister whether his argument is confined to Glasgow. Can he give any other examples of local Acts in respect of which he sees the Secretary of State having to use his power under this Clause? It would be helpful in helping us to understand whether the provisions of this Clause are necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, is it necessary in every case to make Amendments to these local Acts? Will the local authorities not be able to do it under the legislation which we are passing? Will it be necessary
	<span class='label label-info column'>222</span>
in every case, where the powers are weaker, to amend the local Act or will they not be able to act under this part of this Bill? And to the extent to which 'the local authority want to use the powers under this Clause, cannot they just use this Clause when it becomes an Act rather than make Amendments to their own local Act?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising these points. It is too easy to pass these consequential Amendments without understanding what we are doing. In this case it would be helpful to have a wider answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have never known a drafting Amendment to bear such heavy arguments. We are taking this power so that we shall avoid two problems. One is the legal complications of duplicate provisions. The noble Lord the Member for Edinburgh, North (Earl of Dalkeith) always makes this point. I remember his making the point on legislation about air pollution and pollution by oil in navigable waters. When one can proceed under two Acts, it becomes very complicated in the courts. It is a mistake to have two separate provisions, because that can cause legal complications. Therefore, one may wish to repeal certain provisions in order to avoid this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Just as valid is the other argument, which is that local Act powers can be inconsistent with that provided in a general Bill, and it is important to try to get inconsistencies ironed out. I do not have, nor does the Department, a comprehensive, encyclopaedic knowledge of all the ancient Statutes governing the various local authorities in Scotland. We know of two principal local Acts which are often used governing Glasgow and Edinburgh. The powers of that for Edinburgh are much more extensive than that for Glasgow and they were used very successfully in the case of the hurricane damage. The powers of the Glasgow Act are not so strong. Certainly Glasgow is glad that we have these provisions in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be necessary to repeal parts of the Glasgow Act or the Edinburgh Act in order to achieve consistency or to avoid duplicate references. But if that is necessary, I assure the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South that we shall consult the Corporations, as we are required to do in subsection (2). Of course, if a result
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1266">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>223</span>
of that we need additional or supplemental or incidental provisions, to go with the Bill, under subsection (3) we shall put them in the Order. In other words, this is a very timely provision to bring about consistency and to bring about good legal practice in taking over from local Acts, whether they are recent Acts, such as the Glasgow and Edinburgh Acts, or Acts going back to Victorian times or even earlier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clark Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my memory serves me right, the Edinburgh Corporation Order Confirmation Act, 1933, is every bit as good an Act as this will be. What I do not understand is why this Bill should prevail and be used to alter provisions in the Edinburgh Act. It seems to me that this method of bringing the two Measures into line and making the alterations is faulty. I am sorry to badger the Minister, but I am slightly doubtful about the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the correct form for taking over from local Acts provisions which are to become a national standard. I have given two instances—in the Building (Scotland) Act 1959 and the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act, 1960. This is the correct procedure. The reasons for the procedure are as I have given them—consistency and the need to avoid duplication. If the hon. Gentleman is right about this, the Edinburgh Corporation will make that point to us, and if we have to vary the Order to meet Edinburgh's argument we are allowed to do so by subsection (3) and the reference to,
	<br><blockquote><p>"additional, supplemental or incidental provisions".</p></blockquote>
I do not have the terms of the Edinburgh Act in my head, and the hon. Gentleman would not expect that, but there might be provisions in that Act which have nothing to do with this action. In that case they will not be affected by it. We shall draw the Order in such a way as to leave them undamaged. In other words, we shall make no Order affecting Edinburgh without the closest consultation with the Corporation. That is the right way to do it. There is provision for consultation with Glasgow and with any other authority who may have local powers going back over some time. I know that we
	<span class='label label-info column'>224</span>
shall promptly be reminded by a Town Clerk of these powers if we seek ever to make an Order in relation to his authority. In any case, in Scotland we never take such action without consulting the appropriate local authority. Being a relatively small country, we are on very good terms with the chief officers of all the authorities, and we should not dream of making an Order referring to a local Act without going into the matter thoroughly, not only at the Solicitor's desk in St. Andrew's House, but also at the Town Clerks desk and the County Clerk's desk, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We pass to Part III of the Bill. Insofar as it is invidious to pick out any part of the Bill as being more important than another, there is no doubt that this Part, in relation to financial assistance towards the cost of improvements and conversions is one of the most important, as any hon. Member who is in touch with his local authority knows. Many people who might have been carrying out improvement grants have been holding up their applications in the hope that the Bill will be passed. It is important that we make sure that this Clause is passed in the best form possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would the Minister explain the precise purpose of the Clause. It amends Section 13 of the 1968 Act. In the first place, under Clause 32 the Secretary of State is allowed in special circumstances to approve for grant work which the authority has already started. That does not seem an unreasonable provision, but I should be interested to know the circumstances which have caused the Secretary of State to include this provision in the Bill?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1267">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>225</span>
Secondly, the Clause removes, as a condition for grant, the requirement that the building should provide a satisfactory housing accommodation for not less than 30 years. It appears to me that that provision of the 1968 Act is removed by this Clause. I have no particularly strong feeling that this should or should not be done, but I should be interested to know from the Minister of State why it has been considered necessary to do it. Presumably it is based on the working of the 1968 Act. What representations has the Minister of State had from local authorities which have given him cause to make these Amendments?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These points arise later in relation to more detailed provisions, and it would help if the Minister of State explained some of the reasoning behind this Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This Clause applies to Section 13 of the Act of 1968, but with two points which are worthy of comment. It goes right back to the origins of the improvement grant system which was introduced by the Housing (Scotland) Act, 1949. I will not go through the Act of 1949 because we are all familiar with the way in which the system has worked over the years. There has, of course, been amendment of the Act at different times by the Conservative Party and by ourselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In paragraph (	<i>a</i>) of the Clause we introduce a greater flexibility concerning the stage at which the approval of the Secretary of State may be given. The use of the word "proposal", for example, in Section 13 implies that the approval must be given before the work is commenced. A similar point arises in Sections 27 and 40 of the 1968 Act. The effect of paragraph (	<i>a</i>) is to enable the Secretary of State, if he is satisfied that there were good reasons for beginning the works before the improvement proposals were submitted, to give approval after the works have begun. This removes an irritant which we have seen over the years. Indeed, I have a case in my constituency in which this is very much a point in argument. It is still intended that approval should normally precede the beginning of the work, but it is thought that there may be cases in which there would be no reasonable
	<span class='label label-info column'>226</span>
grounds for withholding approval of the work at a later stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph (	<i>b</i>) has the effect of repealing subsection (2) That is because the detailed requirements as to the life of the improved house, which are contained in Section 13(2), are thought to be more appropriate to administrative guidance in the form of a circular or memorandum rather than to provision in Statute. The Secretary of State has it in mind to issue shortly after the enactment of the Bill a handbook giving comprehensive guidance to local authorities. The intention would be that those authorities should be given greater discretion in respect of the life for an improved house which would be appropriate in particular circumstances. I am sorry that the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Bruce-Gardyne) is not here, because this would be a point to meet the complaint which he made. The Secretary of State would expect, of course, to have increased discretion in this regard in relation to applications submitted to him by local authorities. But that I think, taken with the two modifications of Section 13, ought to be welcome to those who are beneficiaries of this legislation—which means Scotland as a whole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hector Munro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the burning topics at the moment is when the higher improvement and standard grants will be paid. Many hon. Members have had letters from constituents who are holding back on improvements in the expectation of getting bigger grants later this year. I know that the Minister will be the first to agree that it is very difficult to forecast when a Bill will go through all its stages and become an Act of Parliament. But I wonder whether he could forecast, for the benefit of those people in Scotland, when he hopes that this provision will come into force both for improvement and for standard grants. We hope that it will be 1st August.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition and ourselves are working very well together on the Bill to try and get it through as early as possible.

Stage in the House. Depending on their Lordships, we might be able to see the Royal Assent to the Bill, if not at the end of the summer, certainly early in October. I hope that we shall manage to get it by the early summer, in which case, of course, we can proceed to operate the Act earlier than if there had been delay. But I could not give a date. I hear mutterings on all sides about Parliamentary business during July, possibly going into August, and it may be that the Bill might be delayed. I am sure that that would not be the wish of any of us here, either on the Government side or on the Opposition side. We shall have to do our best to see how quickly we can get the Bill on the Statute book. We certainly cannot pay grants, as the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In this atmosphere of brevity, I shall try to be brief on this Clause. The Clause increases the amount of grant to local authorities carrying out improvements from £1,400 to £2,500, which this last Amendment technically was about. All I am interested to know in relation to that Amendment is whether the Minister can give us some indication as to what has been the average figure of costs of improvements carried out by local authorities. It would be interesting to the Committee to know to what extent this new amount of grant that we are being asked to approve in this Clause is related to what it is costing our local authorities in houses which they are improving at the present time. It is purely a question of information, and if the Minister has that information, we would be interested to hear how it is working.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1269">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>229</span>
Obviously, we want this figure to be adequate enough to encourage the improvement of older houses that are in the control of local authorities. We understand from representations of local authorities that they are unhappy about this figure of £2,500, and I for one would certainly be interested to know how this is related to the average costs of improvements that they have been carrying out in recent years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think all hon. Members would be interested to know how the figure of £2,500 has been arrived at. Has some calculation been done on an average property—if there is such a thing? I think everybody recognises the difficulty of doing this but, assuming that the original figure was £1,400 and that was intended to cover this piece of average property, what does the £2,500 do? Does it meet the additional cost, or the increased cost of this average property? We are talking in terms of an Act of some time ago. Or does it go a bit further in making more money available to increase the subsidy, if you like, to the owner of the property?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think this is important because, as the Minister knows, it is related to the return and the investment which is tied up with rents and so on. I think it would be appropriate if we had some information as to how the calculation is based.

Finally, could I ask whether it is desirable to have the figure specified in the Bill? Can this be changed by regulation? What is the time scale during which the Minister thinks £2,500 will be adequate?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are fairly relevant questions to which I would like replies, and I put them in a non-partisan manner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed that my hon. Friend put his questions in a non-partisan manner, because he speaks better when he is in a partisan mood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answer is that at the moment, the cost of works and acquisition amounts to about £1,000, but, looking at what should be done in tenements and so on, it really is desirable for us to encourage local authorities to be more ambitious in
	<span class='label label-info column'>230</span>
the way that they improve tenement properties in particular. That is the reason why we have chosen the figure of £2,500. You, Mr. Robertson, have knowledge of what has been done in Paisley, for example, and there are good examples in Port Glasgow and elsewhere in Scotland, where we have attempted, within the present provisions, to improve tenement properties. But they turn out to be quite expensive—certainly beyond the present limit of £1,400 in many cases. Indeed, I remember a whole street of houses being removed completely because £1,400 would go nowhere near the figure required to improve them, and where we did not think, in our discretion—because the discretion is usually reserved for buildings of some peculiar architectural or historic merit—that we could go beyond that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have preserved that in this Bill, but the £2,500 is really the kind of maximum that we think local authorities should move towards, particularly in tenemental properties which, as we all know, are very difficult to improve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the other points that have been made, when the Secretary of State is satisfied at a later stage of the need for additional works which could not reasonably have been foreseen at the time the improvement proposal is submitted, he is given discretion to increase the amount which he determined in the first place. But that amount is, of course, up to the figure of £2,500.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend asked me how long this provision would last. We would like to see local authorities being more ambitious than they have been, and we are now giving them the ability to be so. We should like to see what they do and, as a result of that, we shall then decide whether or not this is a limit to be kept or whether we should, at a later stage in housing legislation, improve on it. That remains to be seen. After all, we have received housing legislation frequently and it would certainly be the intention of this Government to see how this operated and, given three or four years of practice, decide then whether we should make this change or whether to keep it for another three or four years before making a further change, in conformity with changing circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the hon. Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Hugh D. Brown) raised an important point here, and I take it from the Minister's reply that the figure is not just an attempt to keep pace with rising costs, but is a real improvement in the situation, and as such is very welcome, I only wish to say in passing, dealing with the trival point discussed in the previous Amendment, that I must record my dissent from this happy agreement between the two Front Benches. Nobody talks these days of £2,500. The Bill was perfectly clear before, and if it is going to be read by laymen, I think the Minister should think carefully before he is seduced into giving away to the Opposition little Amendments which are the reverse of common sense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>DEFINITION OF IMPROVEMENT IN SECTIONS 13 TO 17 OF ACT OF 1968</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed</i>, That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of elucidation, Clause 34 now alters, under Section 18 of the Act of 1968, the range and type of repair that can be brought into consideration for improvement grants. I should like now a raise a narrow point on this matter, and perhaps return to it later on, if I may with your permission, Mr. Robertson, in relation to repairs so far as discretionary grants are concerned. This is a matter that has given cause to local authorities. We are discussing two different grants for local authorities' houses, and improvements to private houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In what way is the range of repairs that can be brought into consideration for grant widened? Can works of ordinary repair—which, according to my reading of Section 18(2) of the 1968 Act, are excluded, now be brought in, in specific circumstances, such as where, to quote the words of this subsection, they are "replacements" or "incidental" improvements or
	<br><blockquote><p>"are needed, in the opinion of the Secretary of State"?</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>232</span>
This introduces a completely new concept in the definition of repairs, so far as elegibility for grant is concerned. I should like to confine it to the narrow instance of improvement grants to local authority houses. I would like to return to this question later, and I reserve my position on this in relation to discretionary grants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The new definition in this Clause recognises that certain repairs or replacements are incidental to improvements or are necessary for the purpose of making them fully effective, and they ought, in fact, to be treated as improvements themselves. Local authorities have complained to us that they have been debarred from obtaining Exchequer assistance on all repairs which they have had to carry out when they have purchased a house and then wish to improve it. They have complained bitterly about this for some time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not our intention that we should make a major breach and allow them to claim for all repairs. The hon. Gentleman reflected on the handling by local authorities of applications to them by private individuals under the 1968 Act. As the hon. Gentleman knows provision is now inserted in Clause 36 of this Bill, which we will come to in a moment, that not more than half of the approved expense and improvement works is to relate to works of repair and replacement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While we are not putting in a specific provision here in relation to the Secretary of State's handling of applications to him from local authorities, I think the hon. Gentleman can assume as being quite right that we will, as a matter of administrative practice, in any normal case, apply a similar restriction. Of course, we are thinking of major works like structural or roof repairs of a substantial character.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other words, we do not want to leave the Statute as it previously was, which debarred any repair. We are prepared to allow some repairs, but not all repairs. It is very much a matter of administrative handling here as to how we decide. I hope the hon. Gentleman will agree with me that it is a welcome step forward. I sympathise with local authorities which buy these houses and find them in a state of disrepair and then want to improve them; that is why they buy them. I think it is only reasonable
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1271">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>233</span>
that we should be willing to look at this and give local authorities some assistance in this regard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister of State for his explanation. I certainly welcome this widening of the repairs because it gives a greater field of discretion. This affects the Secretary of State on the one hand, and the local authorities on the other, and therefore one will get a fairly consistent interpretation across Scotland as a whole as to the type of repair which will qualify for this grant. To this extent, I think a fairly wide degree of discretion is a good thing, in so far as one person exercises that discretion on one side.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, in these circumstances I certainly welcome in principle the widening of the type of repairs which can be taken into consideration for the grant. I think that in the administrative circumstances of grants to local authority houses this should lead to a fairly consistent application, which I think it is important to get, although I think this will raise other issues when we return to this matter in relation to discretionary grants by local authorities. I am grateful for the explanation and I certainly welcome the widening of these provisions in relation to repairs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>AMENDMENT OF S.27 OF ACT OF 1968</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed</i>, That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are making such excellent progress, Mr. Robertson, that I hope you do not grudge me a few words on some of these Clauses to which we have not put down Amendments. We agree with the principles of these Clauses, but it is helpful to have some further explanation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that Clause 35—perhaps the Minister will confirm this—applies to local authority grants for improvements the same discretion that is given to the Secretary of State under Clause 32, in so far as grants may now be approved
	<span class='label label-info column'>234</span>
where work has already started, provided that there is good reason to do so. If this is correct, I do not intend to go further into that question, because the Minister of State has already discussed the principle of this point in relation to Clause 32.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point on which I should be interested to have further elucidation, and which we have not covered yet, is that under Clause 35 the local authority, having approved a grant, now has power to put a time limit on the period within which the improvement work has to be carried out. I should be interested to know why this has been introduced. It is a new provision. A local authority does not have to specify a particular time limit; it only may do so if it wants to. Again, I should be interested to know what representations there have been from local authorities on this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that it must be extremely annoying and irritating for a local authority, when a grant has been applied for and approved and then the person for whom the grant was approved takes an age to get on with the work, for one reason or another, and the whole job is left outstanding on the local authority's books. I appreciate that this could be extremely irritating and annoying to a local authority. But at the same time I hope that in applying the provisions of this Clause, and where a time limit is specified by the local authority, this is something on which they will use a certain amount of discretion and common sense. After all—and here we return to the same arguments that were used earlier on—there are times, such as after the hurricane damage last year, when the resources of the building industry are very much occupied in other matters and it is difficult to get firms to carry out the work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that by the time a person applies for an improvement grant he has estimates, and so on, and to that extent there are firms which have expressed willingness to carry out the work. But, as I know from my own experience, even if there are firms which have quoted and are apparently willing to carry out the work, occasions arise when, for reasons quite beyond the control of the person who has applied for the grant, and on account of no dilatoriness on his own part, the whole work of improvement is delayed, quite contrary to the desires of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1272">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>235</span>
the person for whom the grant has been approved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that in these circumstances, where there has not been dilatoriness or carelessness on the part of the person who has applied for the grant, but where circumstances are beyond his control, which can certainly arise in practice, the local authority will be reasonable about the length of time limit that it specifies, and indeed, if there are special circumstances where a person exceeds that time limit, and particularly where those circumstances are beyond his control, the local authority will be lenient in making sure that the person does not forfeit his grant because of these circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have nothing against the provisions of this Clause, but certainly if they were applied too strictly and without some discretion in practice, I think they could lead to difficulty, and to that extent it would mean that sections of this Part of the Bill would not be applied to the best purpose to which we would wish to see them applied. If the Minister could give us an assurance on this point, it would be helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask my hon. Friend this question about Clause 35? I apologise to the Committee for not doing my usual homework on this Bill, due to absence on a Parliamentary Commission last week. May I refer to paragraph (a), which provides that the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"before the improvement works are begun"</p></blockquote>
in Section 27 of the 1968 Act shall be ignored. Without reading the Act, those words suggest that before the improvements could be begun permission of some sort is necessary. When we go on to the proposed amendment, it says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A local authority shall not approve an application for an improvement grant if the improvement works have been begun unless they are satisfied that there were good reasons for beginning the works before the application was approved".</p></blockquote>
In certain circumstances, this could suggest to me that there is a weakening of the provisions here. Would I be right in thinking that such work could be begun and an improvement grant given under certain circumstances, whereas previously under the Act such an improvement grant could not be given unless per-
	<span class='label label-info column'>236</span>
mission was sought and given first of all? I hope I have made the point clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a very important change. I wonder if the Minister could indicate who has been pressing for this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Which one?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first one, (1A). My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Hannan) pointed out that this is a substantial change. Who has been pressing for this? I am a bit suspicious about this, and therefore I should like to be quite sure that the reasons for accepting this are sound and valid. Has it been because there has been a delay in approvals by local authorities? What are the implications, and what are the good reasons for starting without approval? Normally, an improvement of a property does not seem to be a matter of life or death. It is something that somebody thinks about over a long while. Invariably, this could only arise in order to prevent a building from falling down. Therefore, why should we allow this to take place without approval?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to be too suspicious, but would it not involve local authorities in extra work, checking up on the work that has already been done? Without putting too fine a point on it, small private builders—and they are usually the ones who will be doing this work—have a very generous regard for the ability of the public purse to provide money. I think that has been everybody's experience in the past. It seems to me a rather dangerous precedent that we are accepting here. I should like to be quite sure that there are good and valid reasons for accepting it, and that there are sufficient safeguards, because there could be a fair amount of extra work involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Three points have been raised on this Clause. May I deal with the first one, namely, the question of 12 months. The hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) has argued the case from the point of view of the individual. I should like to argue the case from the point of view of the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The local authority associations have made quite strong representations to us about this 12 month period. The discretion here is given to the local authority
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1273">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>237</span>
to decide whether or not the person concerned has good reasons for not proceeding within the 12 month period. As it stands at the present time, applicants for grants, are able to get a commitment from the local authority, and therefore the authority is embarrassed in two ways if the applicant does not proceed. First of all, because money is always limited in any activity of government, local or central, it means that someone else who wants to get on with an improvement cannot have it, because the local authority cannot go beyond what it has agreed in terms of its budgetary estimate of expenses for that year. Therefore, a person who has an improvement grant can be holding back someone else who wants to get on with the work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, it would be embarrassing if someone is given the right, as is the case at the moment, suddenly to spring on the authority a demand for payment, with the authority not knowing how to phase its expenditure over given parts of the year. Those of us who have some knowledge of how burgh chamberlains and city treasurers conduct their affairs recognise the importance of that point. Therefore, it is in order to relieve the local authority of this embarrassment and to give more justice to those who want to get on with improvement grants but have not been lucky in getting first place in the queue that we are making this change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot give any assurance about this matter, because it is very much for the discretion of the local authodity. Local authorities will behave quite sensibly about this, and they will not seek to withdraw an application or stop a person going ahead. This is a right decision to make from the point of view of both the local authority and those individuals who want to get ahead with improvements but have not been lucky enough to get a grant and are being held back because of a commitment to another person who is not going ahead with the improvements they have secured in principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Hugh D. Brown) and my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Hannan) referred to the removal of the absolute bar on payment of grants when work has been commenced before application has been made. We have had a number of in-
	<span class='label label-info column'>238</span>
stances which I think could be called injustices when a person has innocently gone ahead without having secured formal permission so to do. Not only individuals but local authorities often get muddled at times when they have to seek the approval of different departments for going ahead with different projects. Dean of guild permission and planning permission are two examples. A person may innocently have gone ahead without having received all the necessary permissions. Often the phrase over the telephone is, "The corporation has agreed", meaning that the corporation in one of its presences has agreed, but the person concerned has innocently thought that the corporation in all its presence has agreed. In such cases, approval should be given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I take the point that this could involve some additional work for local authorities. To prevent injustice, when local authorities agree that, due to ignorance on the part of the applicant or muddle among themselves, and when they sympathise with the person concerned but they are statute barred from doing anything about it, it is right that this change should be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think this is a sensible change. I have one example in my own constituency which I cannot go into for the moment where, because of the present legislation, we are in the absurd position of not being able to pay improvement grant. I hope that this provision will not be abused. I think it is circumscribed enough, but if we have gone perhaps too far let us see how it works out and see if we have to amend it later. I think that we have struck the right balance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The three Amendments meet a sensible practical point which has been put to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Often in the course of carrying out improvement work it is discovered that dry rot or some other defect which was not detected in the early stages of assessment must be dealt with and requires prompt action. These Amendments make it possible for the authority to approve additional expenditure on work the need for which becomes apparent only during the carrying out of the improvement work. It may not always be possible to inform the local authority and get its approval for grant before starting to undertake these works.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These Amendments are a useful addition to the local authority's discretion in operating the grant scheme. We have had a number of examples of this, and I think that these Amendments are worthy of being inserted in the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the Amendments, which are important. They indicate to people who may apply for grants, and in particular to local authorities which will be administering the grant system, that the intention of the Bill is to apply the grant provisions as flexibly and as sensibly as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support very strongly what the Minister of State said about older property. These Amendments recognise the problems which arise when improvements to older property are being carried out. The need for repair is revealed only once the work has started. If the applicant has to go back to the local authority and suspend all work on the site until he gets approval from the local authority, this can lead to needless delay. It can also lead to needless expense if the contractor has to pull off the site and wait for the procedural stages to be gone through whilst the extra work is done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am encouraged by the Amendments. They indicate that the Government and the Secretary of State intend these provisions to be sensibly and realistically
	<span class='label label-info column'>240</span>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Hugh D. Brown) for raising that point. We could develop that argument on our Amendment No. 134, when we return to the wider argument, which I certainly want to do. The point raised by the hon. Member does not specifically apply here. I look forward to hearing what the hon. Member says about our later Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be interested to know why this Clause should be added to Section 27 of the 1968 Act. As I see it, it means that when a building grant has been approved by the local authority, the authority will have to specify how much is attributable to the different parts of the building. I should be interested to know why this is being done, and why the grant must be allocated in this way. Presumably the purpose is to meet situations which may arise in relation to tenements and buildings like that. I have nothing against the Clause, but I should be interested to know the reasons for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to the second point which I referred to earlier, in relation to the reference made to repairs and replace-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1275">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>241</span>
ments. Subsection (2) of the Clause reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>The approved expense of the improvement works shall not be such as to allow for works of repair and replacement more than one-half of that expense or such other part thereof as may for the time being be prescribed.</p></blockquote>
This sounds very simple. I am anticipating Clause 39, but I intend to raise the point now and I shall not return to it on Clause 39. Precisely what repairs and replacements will be relevant? I raised this point earlier on Clause 34. In that case, if there was any reason for dispute between the local authority and the Secretary of State about what constituted repairs and replacements and what constituted improvements, and to what extent repairs and replacements were relevant to the improvements, then the one authority, the Secretary of State, gives a consistent interpretation over the whole of Scotland in relation to different local authorities. With the discretionary improvement grant as administered by the local authority, one is liable to have as many different interpretations of what is a repair and replacement, and to what extent that repair and replacement is relative to the improvement, as there are local authorities administering the discretionary grant. Therefore, there will not be the same consistency of interpretation as there will be under the Clause dealing with the improvement of local authority housing. In principle, I am glad to see the element of repair being extended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second difficulty concerns the local sanitary inspector or clerk of works. He will have to examine the proposals in detail and examine the houses for which improvement grant applications have been made. He will be in the very difficult position of deciding what repairs are relevant when improvement grant applications are made. He will be in the front line of the application of the Bill in discussing and negotiating with applicants whether certain repairs are eligible. There could be dispute between the applicant and the officer of the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One could get an application for an improvement grant for improving the kitchen and scullery of the house. The applicant might say in his application that he wanted to replace bathroom fit-
	<span class='label label-info column'>242</span>
tings as well. He might argue that they were not in a very good state of repair and had been in use for many years. This could put the officer of the local authority in a rather difficult position in deciding how the additional items should be treated. This could lead to considerable practical difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come back to what I said earlier. In principle, I have nothing against this extension. On the other hand, I see considerable practical difficulties arising, particularly for the officers of the local authorities, who will be responsible for administering the improvement grants. We do not want disputes to arise between applicants and the officers of the local authority in deciding what is and what is not relevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps it would be easier to leave this matter for the handbook of guidance to which the Minister of State referred on many occasions. I hope that when the handbook of guidance is prepared the Minister of State will consider including in it specific reference to the type of repair which he thinks should be eligible for inclusion in an improvement grant. If he can be specific on that point it will help local authorities in interpreting this Clause and will help to avoid dispute. Therefore, I hope that, whilst we accept the principle of this Clause, the Minister of State will discuss with local authorities how the Clause may be applied in the most sensible and practical manner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are three points here. This provision is not new. It already exists in Section 27(5) of the 1968 Act. We have rewritten it in the Bill in this way purely for drafting reasons and for ease of reference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point concerns discretion. There are bound to be arguments over the exercise of discretion by local authorities in matters like this. But the final arbiter here is the local authority. The Clause lays down a limitation of up to one-half of the expense. This is perfectly sensible. However, there is no way in which we can oblige local authorities to follow specific points. In fact, the more specific one is, the more rigid one becomes, and it is very difficult to operate the provision properly. So we have to give discretion to the local authorities. We shall seek to give them guidance, but I do not think we can be very specific.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1276">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>243</span>
The hon. Member referred to the replacement of fittings. I think that the Clause, as drafted, is sufficient. It is a mistake for a Minister to try to argue every point in Committee when discretion is given to the local authority. The handbook will be only for guidance. It will not have the effect of a statute. A mistake in past statutes is that they have often been too rigid and have not achieved what they set out to achieve because somebody wanted to be administratively too tidy and to try to anticipate every possible situation, which is beyond human endeavour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the Clause, as drafted, is all right. I am very glad that, in principle, the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns agrees that this is a major step forward by the Government. It has not been done before, and I am sure that it will be welcome throughout Scotland in improving our housing stock.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for what the Minister has said. However, earlier the Minister of State put great weight on the handbook of guidance. When I suggest that something might be included in the handbook, he plays down the force which it will have. It is a pity that he should do that, because if it will not have much weight in relation to the point that I raised, then it cannot have tremendous weight in relation to the points which he has raised. However, that is a small matter. Many local authority people have told me that they use the present handbook of guidance and that the new one will have considerable weight in deciding how they should interpret this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whilst I agree with the Minister that it is very difficult to write in to the Bill exactly what repairs should be included, I hope that he will give an undertaking that, when the Bill becomes an Act, he will watch the situation to see how it develops as between different local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come back to the argument, which is important, about improvements to houses which are owned by local authorities. In the case of grants for local authorities to carry out improvements on their own houses, there is bound to be consistency on the question of repair because the Secretary of State will administer the grants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>244</span>
As the Minister of State knows very well, and as was pointed out in the Cullingworth Report, there is no uniformity of application in discretionary improvement grants over the whole of Scotland between different local authorities. Therefore, the Minister cannot expect consistency about the wider grants that we are discussing. Therefore, I hope that when this Bill becomes an Act, he will watch the situation carefully as between different local authorities' areas so that there is a measure of consistency about how this repair provision is applied. In the past, there have been invidious comparisons. I have spoken to people in certain local authority areas where there is a different attitude towards improvement grants from the attitude in other local authority areas. There is sometimes a feeling of unfairness when, in one area, it is easy to get a grant, but not in another.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very sorry that we are making such heavy weather of this matter. There is a basic difference between Part I and this Part in relation to the handbook of guidance. Clearly, it is important that the guidance should be written sensibly and with great emphasis. But here—and I do not know why the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) does not appreciate this point—the local authority is using its discretion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One can issue handbooks of guidance and administrative suggestions, and so on, but one cannot lay this down, one cannot instruct local authorities on this matter because the Clause spells it out. In fact, the words are "discretionary improvement grants". What more can I say on the matter?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I defy any member of the Committee to write a provision for a Statute that meets every case. I do not dissent from the hon. Gentleman's point that we should try to get a reasonably sound, consistent practice throughout Scotland, but if the choice is between leaving discretion, as the Clause chooses, or having a system which is spelled out specifically, and therefore with some rigidity, then the Government choose the form of the Clause. We have chosen the discretionary system. The hon. Gentleman is trying hard to get away from that to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1277">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>245</span>
some rigid system which, frankly, I cannot promise him we shall ever get. I cannot promise to get to that: I think it is beyond human endeavour. Even if we tried, I think that it would have a counter-productive effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the operation of the Bill, the Government will watch to ensure that the objectives which we are setting ourselves in the Bill are achieved by the use of the Bill. If we are frustrated by lack of or complication of the Statute as we are proposing it here, we shall seek to change it. After all, the 1964 Act was hardly a winner: it set out to do certain things and it achieved the improvement of not a single house. Clearly there was something wrong with that Act. We shall certainly watch this position very carefully. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept our view on that and will realise that the application of my arguments on the handbook to Part I is slightly more important than to this Part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. G. D. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like briefly to raise a point with the Minister: Clause 37 deals with the requirements precedent to the approval of application for these grants, and it refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"satisfactory housing accommodation for such periods and conform with such requirements with respect to construction and physical conditions …"</p></blockquote>
I should like the Minister to say what that period will be. It seems to me that if it is too long it may, to a large extent, stultify the repair of houses which, in the housing condition which exists, for example, in Cities such as Glasgow, would be well worth repairing because of the number of them. If he would give
	<span class='label label-info column'>246</span>
some indication as to what that period is, I should be most grateful to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows that our object is to simplify Section 28. As Section 28 is written, paragraph (	<i>a</i>) provides that the local authority must be satisfied that the houses will, after improvement,
	<br><blockquote><p>"conform with such requirements with respect to construction and physical conditions and provision of services and amenities"</p></blockquote>
as may be specified by the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In paragraph (	<i>b</i>) of Section 28, as it stands provides that the interests of the applicant for the grant must be ownership or the interest of a lessee under a lease with not less than five years to run. The period of five years is substituted for the more complex formula in Section 28(1)(c), which relates to the expected life of the house, and the period of 30 years, whichever is the shorter. We have had some debate, as I mentioned earlier, in the English Committee, dealing with a similar Section, and I promised the Committee, that we would make improvements as we went along. We have a similar provision in the English Bill, which is debated tomorrow, Mr. Robertson, and I hope that the Committee would welcome it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to think about it. I am not certain that it would be wise to specify a blanket figure.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although the Bill has its merits, and we are very glad that it is being pursued in principle, some of us still have lurking doubts that some property which we should prefer to see razed to the ground could be continued in use.

	<br><blockquote><p>"amenities as may for the time being be specified for the purposes of this section by the Secretary of State."</p></blockquote>

At the moment houses receiving improvement grants are expected to have a life expectancy of 30 years, but the local authority may still make an improvement grant if the house has a life of more than 10 years and if they consider it expedient in all the circumstances. What is to be the minimum time? Surely if public money is to be spent, we ought to know the answer. The Secretary of State has by this time some idea of how long the life expectancy of these houses is to be before such money is spent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that it would be a reasonably long time. It ought to be around seven to 10 years, before any public money is spent. This is important to the City of Glasgow. Statistics tend to show that much of the poorer housing in Glasgow lies in the group with low life expectancy. In Glasgow it is mainly in this group of houses that the problem lies. My hon. Friend appreciates the point. I hope that he takes the point that some of us are not so enthusistic about the Bill in respect of the maintenance of some of these houses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a very formidable alliance which I face—Hillhead and Maryhill together. But I must put a plea to them that at present regidity is the enemy of attempts to effect the limited works on some houses which the Bill seeks to secure. It might be the case that we wanted to see grants for appropriate works given over a range of years, as for a range of purposes. That is what the Clause seeks to achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that there are abuses. I realise that discretion here could lead to the possible waste of public money. I accept that there may be misjudgments. That is why it is giving us some concern as to how we should phrase the guidance which we will give to local authorities. But it is either that, frankly, or else we must come back to stating figures. And whenever one states figures, one immediately makes life difficult for those properties which, while not falling within the figures, might justify some expenditure in order to make life just a bit more tolerable for those who are obliged to live in them even for four or five years. After all, that is not a short time in a young family's life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put it to the Committee that it is not unwise to leave this open. I agree that it is unwise not to give
	<span class='label label-info column'>248</span>
guidance and, if the Committee likes, I will think about that further and see whether I can give a more satisfying reply to the two hon. Members at a later stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I, on the other hand, having the concern which the Minister pointed out for people who live in the houses, am afraid that the period may be too long.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am returning to a matter which was raised in an earlier Clause by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Hugh D. Brown) referring to the level of improvement grant. This, I think, is an important Amendment because it affects us throughout this Clause and opens up a debate on the whole question of the level at which the improvement grant ought to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like first to refer to paragraph 175 of the Cullingworth Report. In general the recommendation of Cullingworth was that the rate of improvement grant should be 75 per cent.—increased from the old rate of 50 per cent. to 75 per cent.—unless the landlords could be certain of being enabled to charge a fair rent. In that recommendation the Cullingworth Committee realised in practical terms that there was very little hope in tenanted property of landlords being able to take advantage of the improvement grant. Indeed, in paragraph 164 they have a list of the improvements and conversions carried out by different classes of owners between 1960 and 1965. The Cullingworth Committee rightly concluded, that unless a landlord were able to get a proper return on his investment, it was most unlikely that he would be able to carry out the improvements to his property. For that reason they rightly recognised that a landlord owning property was owning something of a commercial nature and that he must be able to get a return on his capital if we are to get the property improved. For that reason they said that the grants should be increased to 75 per cent. unless we were certain that landlords would be able to charge a fair rent on their property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we all know, under Part IV of the Bill the Government are making provision for rents to be altered, particularly in
	<span class='label label-info column'>250</span>
relation to property which has been improved. I ask the Minister of State whether he is satisfied that the provisions under Part IV of the Bill will be sufficient to enable landlords to charge that rent which will make certain that they carry out the improvements to their property which the Cullingworth Committee said they were unable to carry out simply because they had not the necessary finance. I do not intend to go into that any more deeply, because I have no doubt that we shall return to it in more detail later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the second point which I should like to make I regard as possibly more important, because later we are to discuss the provisions and whether we think rents will be fair. I return to a point which I think is important and more relevant to this Amendment, because we shall not be able to return to it so easily later. It is contained in paragraph 169 of Cullingworth. In paragraph 169 and in previous paragraphs of that section of the Report, the Cullingworth Committee call to their aid the Milner Holland Report, which was the Report of the Committee on Housing in Greater London in 1965. I should like to read paragraph 169, although I do not intend to go into all their arguments. The section relates to Scotland, remembering that the Milner Holland Report referred specifically to housing conditions in greater London. The Cullingworth Committee concluded:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Our evidence entirely supports the analysis and the views put forward in the Milner Holland Report. We can see no prospect of any significant increase in improvements by private landlords until they are allowed to charge reasonable rents"</p></blockquote>
—a point with which we have already dealt—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and to receive a reasonable post-tax return on their properties."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am trying very hard to relate the hon. Member's arguments about rent to this Amendment. The Amendment seeks to increase the proportion from one-half to three-quarters, and that is the point which he should argue in relation to this Amendment. If, however, the hon. Member feels that he has to develop the wider argument, it would mean that I could not allow such a discussion on the Question, That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1280">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>251</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intended to raise the point entirely in relation to the Amendment. I had not intended to return to this argument on the Question, That the Clause stand part of the Bill. It is much better dealt with in relation to this one point, otherwise we shall go over much of the same ground again. If you and the Committee are agreeable, Mr. Robertson, I would rather deal on the Amendment with the whole question of the level of improvement grants in relation to the return for the private landlord.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is acceptable to the Chair. I hope that the Committee will note that there will be no discussion on the Question, That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Robertson. I am sure that it will meet with the agreement of the Committee if I raise the whole question of the level of grants and the adequacy of grants on this Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I related the first part of my argument to the level of rents. I have turned from the level of rents to the second conclusion which was drawn in the Cullingworth Committee's Report, in addition to having a satisfactory level of rent in order to make sure that private landlords carried out the improvements which the Bill seeks. The Cullingworth Committee said that landlords would not carry out these improvements, and would not be able to carry out these improvements unless:
	<br><blockquote><p>"they are allowed to charge reasonable rents and to receive a reasonable post-tax return on their properties."</p></blockquote>
We shall undoubtedly return to the question of rents later in the Bill. The point which I much more specifically want to raise in relation to this Amendment is that so far the Government have done nothing—and I appreciate that it could not fall within this Bill but would presumably have to come in a Finance Act—the Government have not done and show no indication of doing anything to improve the post-tax return to landlords. I am relating the point to this Amendment, because if the Government are not prepared to improve, or have no intention of doing anything to improve, the post-tax return of landlords, then we must look at the question whether the level
	<span class='label label-info column'>252</span>
of improvement grants—the 50 per cent. level—is adequate. If the Government could give me an assurance in relation to the post-tax return of landlords, if they were prepared to tell us that the matter was under consideration and that the Government were looking into the question, then the arguments which I have put forward would tend to fall. Therefore, my purpose in raising the point is to discover exactly what are the Government's intentions in relation to this recommendation of the Cullingworth Committee about the post-tax position of landlords of private property. If the Government have no intention to assist landlords on the lines that the Cullingworth Committee recommend, we have to consider whether the level of improvement grant which we are discussing in the Bill is adequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we said on Second Reading and as we have said at all other stages of the Bill, if we are to seek every possible means of improving the housing situation in Scotland, we must consider not only local authority housing and privately-owned and occupied housing but also that section of housing which is owned by private landlords and rented out to tenants. We must not ignore the position of the private landlord, whether he is the owner of one or two houses or represents those larger concerns which own much more property. Unless we can make sure that landlords get a reasonable return on the money they invest, we shall close one of the sources of finance which is available for the improvement and the provision of housing in Scotland to that standard which we believe to be necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of moving the Amendment is simple and straightforward. It is to make certain that we mobilise the resources of all the different sections who can contribute towards improving housing in Scotland. That includes the private landlords, who have an equally important part to play.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Fitzroy Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I shall be in order in reverting to a point on which I touched when we were discussing the Bill in principle, and which I proposed to raise on the Question, That the Clause stand part of the Bill—namely, that provision should be made for bigger grants for restoration and reconstruction in remote areas, and particularly in islands. People who do not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1281">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>253</span>
live in islands or in remote areas—and some remote areas are very remote—do not always realise that building operations in these places are bound to cost much more than they cost in places nearer by. The reason is higher freight charges and higher transport costs, not only for material but often for labour, too, because if the labour is not available in the remote area, as it very often is not, it has to be brought specially from wherever it is available, and that very often means that the workers concerned either have to travel long distances back and forth, which costs much more, or, alternatively, have to be accommodated on the site, which also costs more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The County of Bute in my constituency, although it is not officially recognised as part of the Highlands and Islands, in fact consists entirely of islands, and in all of these islands, in Bute itself, in Arran and in Cumbrae, building costs are markedly high. One of the effects of this is that on the whole fewer houses are built than would be the case otherwise, and that, of course, makes it much more necessary to get the best use we can out of older houses, to restore them whenever possible and to encourage their owners to do that instead of just letting them fall into disrepair because owners feel that it is not worth their while to do anything about them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Minister of State has given a firm promise, which I heard him give, to link the Island of Bute with the mainland by bridge. I was particularly glad to hear him say that, because I know—and I hope that my hon. Friends on the Front Bench will also take in the point—that any future Administration are bound to regard themselves as bound by that promise. But what I fear is that it may be some time before it is fulfilled. No doubt some day building materials and building labour will come pouring across the new bridge from Colintraive to Rhubodach, but at present that is not so and the cost of building in Bute is still very high. The comparable problem in Arran and in Cumbrae can probably never be solved in the same way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Meanwhile, as I have said, not all that many new houses are being built at present. Many old houses, unfortunately, have been demolished or have fallen
	<span class='label label-info column'>254</span>
into disrepair which could have been restored. I hope that everything possible will be done to encourage restoration. The Bill offers an opportunity of doing so, and I hope that the Minister will find some way of helping the inhabitants of the Islands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I always admire the skill which the hon. Member for Bute and North Ayrshire (Sir F. Maclean) employs in bringing in constituency points. A fair example was the bridge to Bute. I think it is stretching it a bit to relate it to this Bill, because though he says that one of the reasons for the lack of improvements to certain houses in the remote areas is the cost, I do not think that that is strictly true. Take places such as Largs, Millport and Rothesay; the price of buying a room and kitchen in Millport, as a holiday resort, is much higher than the price of the same room and kitchen in Glasgow. I do not think that the reason is solely the fact of the cost of carrying out repairs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman not agree that the cost of building in Millport, Rothesay and Brodick is higher than the cost of building in Largs? The point which I am making is that the cost of building on an island is higher because materials and labour have to be carried over the water.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an obvious point. I had better not pursue it too far. All I was saying was that the cost of buying a room and kitchen is much higher in Largs and Millport or some of the holiday resorts than it is in Glasgow. I do not think that the problem is solely the additional cost of repairs and improvements and the cost of building generally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point which I wish to raise brings problems for all of us, let us face it, both ideological and practical, because it is related to the substance of the Cullingworth Report and the relationship between the money invested in property and the return which is to be expected on it. I should like the Minister to give us some information about who are the property owners in Scotland. About whom are we talking here? It has always
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1282">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>255</span>
been my understanding that, for example, the Churches were large property owners—certainly that in parts of Glasgow both the Catholic Church and the Church of Scotland were substantial property owners, sometimes of property of which one was not particularly proud.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But what information do we have about the changes which are taking place? We hear perhaps exaggerated stories about some of the property companies which have been set up. Are they genuinely interested in getting a return from the property or are they more interested in acquiring property because of the development value which will ultimately be attached to it? What change is taking place? We know about the poor widow who owns one house which is her sole source of income, and I should not like to be misled by that argument, but with whom has the Minister had discussions on the recommendations of Cullingworth? Personally I am in a bit of a difficulty. I want to be assured—I hope that this does not sound a Conservative argument—that some inducement is given to investment though, quite frankly, I would rather that we returned to the original conception of encouraging local authorities to acquire more property. But whichever way we do it, it presents us with problems. Can we have the maximum information as to the changes which are taking place in this property-owning democracy? Who has made the representations and what kind of case have they made?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Small</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In considering the difference between grants of a half and three-quarters, what element would it represent in fixing a fair rent? If there were a flood of applications to make improvements because more than 30 per cent. was paid, and we increased it to 75 per cent., at which point do we fix a fair rent? I do not find myself in support of raising it above 30 per cent. In view of the practices which go on at present, I prefer the approach of my hon. Friend the Member for Provan (Mr. Hugh D. Brown).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a case of shifting the blame on to the Government for the abandonment of people who reside in single tenement houses. Following 40 years of Rent Restriction Acts, landlords may have difficulty in modernising in 1969, but the quickest way to get rid of the problem

Maclean). After he has made a contribution like that, I have no doubt that great virtue will accrue to him in the local Press in his area and and that the citizens of Cumbrae will say, "Good. Here is our Member of Parliament speaking up for cheaper building. Here we want a bridge." All sorts of virtues will accrue to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a tenable point of view, except for one difficulty: I have a simple belief that politicians who bid for that kind of virtue in their own constituencies ought to give us some cost analysis, some indication of the cost to the Exchequer, of the programme which is proposed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did the hon. Member say that it was a "tenable" or a "terrible" point of view? Either way, if he is in agreement with the principle of the Bill, that we should try to restore old houses rather than pull them down and build new ones at much greater cost, then he will agree that that principle should be applied to remote areas where transport costs—and I can assure him that this is the case—make building very much dearer. It is an obvious point. The increase in the cost varies the whole time—and it varies upwards. It goes up the whole time, as anybody who has had any experience of these matters must know.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a perfectly tenable point of view and if I represented the hon. and gallant Gentleman's constituency, that is probably the point of view which I should hold. My objection is different, namely that far too many of us are against increases in public expenditure in general, but when it becomes a matter of particular public increases in expenditure which may be desirable on our own doorstep, we gaily put forward proposals without giving any indication at all of the cost to the Treasury. I think that when, in the Scottish Grand Committee or elsewhere, Members of Parliament put forward proposals which doubtless will be reported in their local Press, there ought to be some recognition of the fact that they will add to public expenditure.

I therefore ask my hon. Friend the Minister of State whether today or at some convenient moment he would ask the Department to do a brief analysis of the cost of the hon. and gallant Gentleman's proposals. We should get much further if some cost indication were done before such proposals were made. If it were, many of the proposals made by hon. Members, which, frankly, make politicians of all Parties look rather foolish, might not be made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman makes a blanket condemnation of what my hon. and gallant Friend said, he should refer to paragraph 176 of the Cullingworth Report:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As soon as a house is improved its valuation is increased. Indeed we have come across cases where the increase in rates is more than sufficient to 'pay back' an improvement grant in ten years. This may constitute a very good 'investment' for the local authority but it has been put to us (and we accept the contention) that the result is a serious deterrent to improvements."</p></blockquote>
That indicates, I think, that investment by the local authority or by the Treasury in house improvement grants gives a return to the local authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has it not also occurred to the hon. Member that, by preserving old buildings, one cuts down on the number of new buildings which have to be put up, and that is another way in which money can be saved in addition to the way which my hon. Friend mentioned?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I happen to be extremely interested in all points of view about the preservation of old buildings. I believe in their preservation. I completely accept these points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All I am saying is that, before speeches like that are made, some clear indication ought to be given of the financial burden on the Treasury in the short term. My objection is an objection not to the substance of the hon. and gallant Gentleman's proposals but to this constant hypocrisy—and, heaven knows, he is not the only guilty one; I think often all of us of all parties are guilty of it—of saying, "Yes, we are in favour of cutting public expenditure in general, but, when we have a pet scheme of our own, then of course the restrictions which we im-
	<span class='label label-info column'>258</span>
pose on the Treasury and public expenditure should be waived ".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that my hon. Friend the Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) is a very sincere man, and I know that he has often said the same thing in application to his own constituency, so I hope that his admonition to us all, even though it was initially directed at the hon. and gallant Member for Bute and North Ayrshire (Sir F. Maclean), is accepted in the spirit in which it was uttered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that any of us will quarrel over investment in housing. We all realise that investment in improvement grants helps to improve the stock of houses and eases the general housing position. By the way, I do not agree with the argument that, because we improve a house, we are therefore saved the prospect of building a new one. In the very long term—yes. In the short term—no. The more houses we improve, the more it should give us anxiety to get on with the new house-building programme so that we can reach the stage at which everyone is living in a good house. The danger of this Bill—and I think we are all very much aware of it, having debated it on the last Amendment—is that we may, by repair and patching, give ourselves a comfortable excuse to feel that that is all we have to do and that we can afford to reduce the house-building programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should regard it as a great betrayal of the people of Scotland if the Bill, particularly if it were a very successful Bill, were used as an argument for reducing the new house-building programme. I should regard that as reprehensible. I hope that we shall continue to build more houses each year than we built in the previous year. If the Conservative Party come to power, I hope that they will pledge themselves to do that, too. Come hell or high water in economic affairs, I hope that this is the pattern of programming in Scotland. Whatever we do under this Bill, in Bute or elsewhere, we should maintain a level of house building higher than that of the year preceding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most important question—if I may say so without unfairness to the others—was raised by my hon. Friend the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1284">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>259</span>
Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Hugh D. Brown) when he asked, "Who are the property owners?". I cannot give a great dissertation of the change in the structure of ownership in Scotland in relation to property companies, although I think it is a valid point. Many of these companies are not coming into property to improve the housing stock of Scotland. They are coming in to secure advantageous points in certain great cities and large burghs in order to seek the demolition of that property and its replacement with commercial enterprises of different kinds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I can acknowledge, in considering the Bill and improvement grants generally, is that it is quite clear
	<span class='label label-info column'>260</span>
that this Measure will be used more and more by owner-occupiers. Taking the present rate, out of every six houses which are improved by improvement grants, five are improved by owner-occupiers. Let me give the figures as at the moment: 3,064 for owner-occupiers, compared with 670 under other headings. It shows clearly that, with the change in the position of landlords, who more and more are tending to sell their properties, it is to the owner-occupier that we are addressing the plea to improve his house.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
