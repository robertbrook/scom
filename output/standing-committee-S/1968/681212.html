	<div class='title'>MEANING OF APPOINTED DAY</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed</i> [	<i>10th December, 1968</i>], No. 7, in page 1, line 19, leave out from 'Act' to the end of line 23.—[	<i>Mr. Manuel.</i>]</p>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir John Gilmour</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sir Myer, on the last occasion I was telling the Committee about difficulties experienced in other countries, for example, Australia, not with foxes but with dingoes, which do equal harm to sheep stocks. I fear that if the course the Minister has agreed is followed sheep farmers in the north of Scotland will be driven to using poison in a large way to control foxes. This would have a bad effect on wild life in general, and poison can also be picked up by domestic animals. I hope, therefore, if the Amendment is accepted, that the Minister will give us some indication how the fox population, particularly in the north of Scotland, will be controlled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This proposal is bound to have a serious effect on farming. I do not think that the hon. Gentleman realised sufficiently on Tuesday the difference between the lowland sheep farmer, who is able to bring his lambing ewes in by the steading and have them in an area where artificial lights can be fixed and so on, and the hill farmer. For that reason, the Amendments put down by my hon. Friends commanded a good deal of support among agriculturalists and even among the Committee as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that in doing what all of us seek to do, which is to get rid of the gin
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>46</span>
trap, the Minister will definitely admit the necessity for and will provide some other means of protection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is always an element of risk attached to a very quick reaction to an entirely unexpected announcement. The announcement made by the Under-Secretary was, in the light of what he said at Second Reading, calculated to take the Committee by surprise. In the course of what I have to say I shall remind the hon. Gentleman of the case that he detailed in the debate on the principle of the Bill. Since Tuesday there has been time to reflect, time to read the hon. Gentleman's speech at Second Reading, and time to read what was a quite extraordinary contribution to the debate on Tuesday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was surprised that the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) should lend his name in support of the Amendment which we are discussing after the admission which he made in his speech at Second Reading that this was a very difficult matter and one that we must weigh very carefully indeed. All his arguments at Second Reading were against what he is now supporting. He devoted nearly all of his speech to claiming that the Bill was not necessary—that was the whole trend of his remarks—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archie Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So did the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: —and that the present procedure was perfectly correct. That is what the right hon. Gentleman said throughout his speech. He said:
	<br><q><p>"With a difficult problem which we do not know how to solve, but for which we are hoping for a solution, surely we need flexibility."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Scottish Grand Committee,</i> 26th November, 1968; c. 24.]</p></q>
One thing which this Amendment does not provide is flexibility. It provides a date of termination with none of the flexibility which the Order provides and which the right hon. Gentleman advocated at Second Reading. But it is perfectly clear, looking back, that the right hon. Gentleman was goaded far beyond endurance by the deplorable performance of the Minister. In what I might describe, sadly for all of us, as the sunset of his days in this Committee, who shall blame him perhaps for kicking over the traces on Tuesday?
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0433">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>47</span>
I now want to deal seriously—I presume the hon. Gentleman regarded it as a serious contribution to the debate—with the speech of the Minister in reply to the Amendment. It was an extraordinary speech for the absolute falseness of its reason. The hon. Gentleman, after referring to Ministers listening to the views of democracy, said that
	<br><q><p>"the Committee has made it clear that hon. Members want a definite and absolute date laid down …"—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 10th December, 1968; c. 39.]</p></q>
The Committee did no such thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting to go back through the contributions made by the hon. Gentleman at Second Reading. There was no question at that time of the Minister's view. He came strongly out against a fixed date. He said:
	<br><q><p>"Why do we introduce the possibility of deferment? Not to wait for a set of circumstances to arise which will let us do so, but because nobody can predict a situation in four years' time."</p></q>
After having drawn a little breath, he went on:
	<br><q><p>"Discretion should be left to those whose responsibility it will be to deal with that situation to bring in the order."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Scottish Grand Committee,</i> 26th November, 1968; c. 41–2.]</p></q>
The Minister's view at Second Reading is clear. My own views on the matter were expressed with the lucidity for which I am famous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is not serious!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Then we went on to the speech, to which I thought considerable attention should be paid, of the right hon. Member for East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn). He did not come down on either side, but he advised the Committee to be extremely cautious about taking this step. The hon. Member for Ross and Cromarty (Mr. Alasdair Mackenzie) was dead against it. As I said on Tuesday morning, no one in this Committee has more practical experience of the likely effects of this Measure than he, with the possible exception of my right hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble). Then we went on to the speech of the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East, to which I have referred, and then to the speech of my hon. Friend the Member
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>48</span>
for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) to whom I pay tribute for his complete consistency in the matter. He has been strongly in favour of a fixed date being laid down as soon as possible, and he has never made any bones about it. The hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Mr. Maclennan) was not at all critical of Clause 2(1)(	<i>b</i>) during his speech, but he made an intervention in the Minister's reply which made it clear that he would like a fixed date. So did the hon. Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. W. Baxter), and, quite definitely, the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel). But my hon. Friends the Member for Banff (Mr. W. H. K. Baker) and the Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. Wolrige-Gordon) were against it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So we have a tally of five hon. Members in favour, five hon. Members against, and two right hon. Members who did not really declare themselves on the matter at Second Reading. Therefore, no one can say that the Committee had made it absolutely clear that it wanted a definite decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the course of the Minister's remarks on Tuesday morning, we had what I thought was a highly enigmatic remark about the National Farmers Union. He said:
	<br><q><p>"I assure hon. Members that I am not ignoring them to any extent."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>First Scottish Standing Committee;</i> 10th December, 1968; c. 39.]</p></q>
He is ignoring them completely and absolutely. They are the views of men who think as they do not because they lack compassion, not because they want to do cruel things, but because they have a much greater insight—I do not blame the hon. Gentleman for this, but it is one of the facts of life—into the likely effects of the ban being made absolute in the Highlands area of Scotland in 1973.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The compassion that I hold for foxes caught in gin traps I extend to the hon. Gentleman, because he was totally unable to be straightforward with the Committee on Tuesday morning. He was asked three times what his intentions were regarding an Amendment which had the greatest relevance to the Amendments we were discussing for most of the morning. On three occasions he hedged and evaded and refused to take the Committee into his confidence. Not until ten minutes to one, a time when he was
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0434">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>49</span>
clearly hoping to get the Bill that morning and could conceal the matter no longer, did he make his intentions known.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. A. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman think that he is making rather heavy weather of this? When 1973 comes, whatever Government are in power will be able to take any necessary steps if there should be any different circumstances, and different from those foreseen today, but, as the Minister said, somebody has to get a move on, and setting a date will help to get a move on. If, by any unfortunate chance, the problem has not been solved, the Government at that time can deal with it. We need not deal with that today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman is making a very good case for not having had the Committee's time wasted for the last three days over a matter which, under order, can at this moment be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude with a quotation from the Minister's speech at Second Reading in which he rebuked his hon. Friend the Member for Caithness and Sutherland. I thought it was a rather stinging rebuke. He said:
	<br><q><p>"There is no intention to defer it. Deferment will depend on Parliament allowing it to be deferred after an assessment of this situation. It may only arise if there is a gross or catastrophic change in the situation. I hope that if such a situation arose my hon. Friend would be prepared to have another look at this in four years' time."</p></q>
The hon. Gentleman was referring to the hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland.
	<br><q><p>"I am responsible for Scottish agriculture, and for the first time I would give him a little advice on his responsibility for his constituency."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Scottish Grand Committee;</i> 26th November, 1968; c. 43.]</p></q>
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What could that catastrophic change be? It could only be the possibility of a large increase in the number of foxes. If that happens now, there could be no scrutiny by Parliament, which was one of the major points made by the Minister, not once, but several times, in his speech. If we are talking about responsibility, my view is that, in the light of the remark he made and of the rebuke he then passed on his hon. Friend, the hon. Gentleman has completely abdicated his res-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>50</span>
ponsibilities in this matter. I therefore hope that he will think it right seriously to consider whether, if he is going to evade his responsibilities in this way, he should continue to hold his office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened to the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) with great interest. He made a Schoolman's speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Norman Buchan)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Junior or secondary?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In other words, he went through the debate which took place last Tuesday and that which took place at Second Reading and picked out points on which he could offer a few remarks. I am disappointed in the hon. Gentleman. I should have thought that he, who prides himself on being a practical farmer, would have laid the practical difficulties before the Committee. We heard no word about them. At least the hon. Member for Fife, East (Sir J. Gilmour) tried to deal with some of the practical difficulties. An exposition of practical difficulties from the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West would have been helpful. A university debating society attitude towards speeches, and a consideration of how one phrase should be interpreted and how another should not be interpreted, is not good enough. The hon. Gentleman, with his long experience of the Committee, should know that this is essentially a practical Committee. The Scot has a reputation for being essentially practical. We want some facts. We want to know what the difficulties are. I think that there are difficulties, but I would have liked to have heard the hon. Member on this, because he has practical experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that it would be out of order to discuss this in detail, but in passing may I say that there was an Amendment which would have created a very stupid position in some areas of Scotland, in that small areas which would have been affected would have been surrounded by areas which would not have been affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, West was very fair in quoting what I said. As he said, I outlined the difficulties but did not come down on one side or the other. I took the view that the Bill was unnecessary in view of the present position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0435">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>51</span>
I had a long argument with my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, in my customary mild manner, about the interpretation of the words which determine the Government's action under present legislation. My hon. Friend said that he would look into this. He said that the legal advice he has received is that it meant what he said it meant. I accept my hon. Friend's contention, although I still have the right to be rather dubious about it, because, after all, only the courts can interpet legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is so, and we intend to legislate, we should do something more definite than is done in the Bill. The Bill creates uncertainty. There is no certainty in the Bill that anything will be done. As I said on Second Reading, there could be a sort of Expiring Laws Continuance Bill every year covering the Bill; and the present position could continue indefinitely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question was, did the Bill mean that we intended to abolish the gin trap? My hon. Friend said that the Government wanted to. This was not clear from the Bill. The agricultural community in Scotland might well take this view: "If a suitable trap has not been designed, we will not have to do anything about it. It does not look as though a suitable trap will be designed. Therefore, we will not do anything about it." I would not blame the farmers for taking that view. I am trying to understand the practical effect on the minds of those living in these areas. They would weigh up the pros and cons and say, "There does not seem to be any need to do anything. Till we have this cheap and efficient trap, nothing need be done. It has not been possible up to now to get it. Therefore, we do not think anything will be done."
There is no incentive. This is part of the uncertainty. It is a kind of guessing competition on the part of those affected as to what they think the effects are likely to be and whether they think anything is to be done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the group which must show the greatest incentive, not the farmers, to whom I rather think the right hon. Gentleman has been referring, but the Humane Traps Panel, which has been charged with the job of finding a tray and on which body the Government, in the form of the Department, are repre-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>52</span>
sented? Therefore, the Government have a great responsibility to give an incentive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was coming to that. Having dealt with the people living in the areas affected, I was coming on to deal with what incentive is given to the panel, which is supposed to try to invent a humane trap. There is no incentive for the panel to do much about it, because it knows that, if it cannot do anything, the present position merely continues. This is unsatisfactory. Even though the Government are represented on the Panel, the fact that there is no urgency about this is not likely to stimulate the body to making tremendous efforts. There is nothing like saying, "We want something done by a certain date", to get it done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the Bill as it stands is undesirable. If we are to do anything about the problem, we must say, "We intend to abolish this. We will allow reasonable time for the necessary arrangements to be made. Then the Bill will take effect". The date is to be 1973, which is reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Fife, East asked what the alternatives were. As I said last week, I have never known an animal which, when men decided to pursue it, hunt it and kill it, was not almost exterminated. Some of the most difficult species to find, track, hunt and kill have been almost exterminated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With an incentive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are problems about foxes. One problem in some areas has been the fact that the fox has not been hunted out of necessity, but for sport. Therefore, there was a need to preserve some of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir J. Gilmour</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The problem is what is to happen in the sheep rearing areas of Scotland, particularly the Highlands, which is one of the areas where hunting has never been practised. Therefore, the right hon. Gentleman's argument is nonsense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that the Highland terrain is not suitable for fox hunting. I said that in some areas foxes have been preserved for sport. They must be preserved if people are to get sport out of them. One of the difficulties is that foxes have been preserved to cater for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0436">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>53</span>
those who love to chase them about the countryside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem in Highland areas is more difficult, but it is not beyond ingenuity to solve it. At Second Reading my hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. W. Baxter) asked, "Why not pay so much a head to catch them?"</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So much a brush.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not being a fox hunting man, I got the terminology wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This has been a useful method with other animals, so why not adopt it with foxes? A lot of foxes would be caught if it were worth while catching them. There may well be other methods of catching them. On Tuesday I suggested that, if foxes became the great menace to livestock that people say they are, far more energy might be devoted to pursuing and killing them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is not insoluble, given time. Four years seems to be a reasonable time. If we insert the date, it will at least make the Bill meaningful and clear up doubts as to the Government's attitude. It will provide a spur to people to tackle the problem with more vigour. Such vigour has been lacking because it has been realised that the date was not fixed and could be indefinitely postponed. I recognise the difficulties but we must make up our minds some time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) expressed on Tuesday more eloquently than I could the desire to abolish the gin trap, but the proposal shall not be hedged with qualifications. We should not be prepared to have a system of uncertainty. That was the hon. Gentleman's argument, and I myself am not convinced that there should merely be a vigorous statement of intent hedged around with qualifications. On balance, I come down for a definite date, as the hon. Gentleman did. This would at least satisfy a number of his criticisms of the Bill made at Second Reading. I supported those criticisms. I give him credit for having dug out a great deal of material. I was particularly impressed by his question as to whether the Bill was really necessary. That arose because it was tending to prolong the existing situation. However, we now have the proposed change which is neces-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>54</span>
sary because it will do something positive. That is a good thing, and the Committee should support the Amendment. I am glad that my hon. Friend has decided to accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Clark Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the Amendment. I am only sorry that the date is not earlier than 1973. If the Under-Secretary of State had made his ideas clearer earlier on, he would have saved me and the Committee a lot of bother. However, he has done the right thing. I want to be shot of the gin trap in Scotland. The earlier the better. I have never wavered from that view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, want to see the gin trap abolished as soon as possible. In the south of Scotland, I would be happy to see it go tomorrow but, broadly speaking, our main worry has always lain with the Highlands, and my remarks will be mainly directed to that area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary of State has not yet given a clear indication of how he thinks things will develop in that area with the abolition of the gin trap by 1973. We on this side were disappointed by his attitude on Tuesday. Had he been honest at the start, had he come clean, the course of the debate would have been different.

However, I want to deal with the main issue. We have heard of the serious situation in which a large number of small lambs are killed by foxes in the Highlands. Over and above the more important issue of the death of young livestock, this represents a serious financial loss. What incentive has the hon. Gentleman been giving to the production of a humane trap? Why cannot the Department, with the co-operation of the Humane Traps Panel, offer a prize of £1,000 in the hope of getting a quick result? Economically, this would be well within the bounds of the hon. Gentleman's power. Taking into account the loss of lambs over the years, it would be of tremendous benefit to the country. The loss of lambs is about 2,000 a year. Let us make a dramatic effort to find a solution. How often has the hon. Gentleman met the Panel? Has he met it this week? Has he asked it to make a big effort now? We have to find a solution now that the Government have decided that the trap will go in 1973. Has the hon. Gentleman spoken to the Forestry Commission? It does not use the trap. Has he taken its advice? Has he encouraged it to increase the number of its keepers? What practical steps has he taken to help farming in the Highlands on this serious problem?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) asked what incentive the hon. Gentleman was giving to the killing of foxes in the Highlands? Why cannot he give a big sum of money—perhaps £5—for each fox killed? And let not that be entangled in red tape; let it be a simple system of producing the fox at the police station and getting cash on the nail. Let us have speedy action. What incentive is the hon. Gentleman giving to fox clubs? What help is he giving to the establishment of more fox and vermin clubs in the High-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>56</span>

My hon. Friend began by saying that the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. Wolrige-Gordan)
	<br><q><p>"seems to be the only hon. Member who recognises that I propose to abolish the gin trap."</p></q>
He added that the Bill
	<br><q><p>"proposes to abolish it."</p></q>
A little later, my hon. Friend said:
	<br><q><p>"We are putting down 1973 as being the date on which the gin trap will be abolished."</p></q>
Again, he said soon afterwards that
	<br><q><p>"we are saying that we will bring it in whether the humane alternative is introduced or not."</p></q>
Later still he said:
	<br><q><p>"However, we are saying that we intend to abolish the gin trap whether or not there is an alternative or the circumstances have changed."</p></q>
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) quoted that sentence himself but did not quote also the crucial sentence:

	<br><q><p>"… I am proceeding to abolish the gin trap, but allowing four years to do it. I am pleased to be abolishing the gin trap."</p></q>
It seems to me that my hon. Friend should have been brought to order for tedious repetition. Despite these reiterations, he repeated:
	<br><q><p>"The purpose of the Bill is to set a date when the gin trap will be abolished unless the Secretary of State, approved by Parliament, decides to bring it forward or to push it back."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Scottish Gland Committee,</i> 26th November, 1968; c. 40–6.J</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The hon. Member for Edinburgh, North (Earl of Dalkeith) spoke of the treatment of lambs. He said that to his knowledge no lamb had been attacked if it had been treated by creosote. My hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. W. Baxter) suggested giving a sum of money for each brush. The hon. Member for Banff (Mr. W. H. K. Baker) spoke about fox cubs. It is nonsense to suggest that, within four years from all the suggestions that have been made, we cannot find a way of dealing with this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been said, I believe by Dr. Johnson, that the thought of approaching execution concentrates a man's mind wonderfully. I wish that this could be applied to foxes. There has been reference to enforced co-operation—I do not know how co-operation could be enforced—with fox hunting clubs to try to achieve some success.

I do not think the N.F.U. in its circular letter of 6th December was altogether hostile to the proposition. I admit that I can quote only the first sentences. It said:
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>58</span>
	<br><q><p>"We would recommend that the Bill be amended to ensure that it does not come into effect before 1973."</p></q>
That seems to suggest that the N.F.U. is accepting that this proposition will come about. All it is asking is that it should not come into effect before 1973. It is true that the letter says:
	<br><q><p>"This would still leave the Secretary of State power to withdraw authorisation to use the gin trap before that if an effective humane trap were discovered…."</p></q>

This morning we are disputing the date. It is quite wrong to impute dishonesty to my hon. Friend the Under Secretary. My hon. Friend the Member for Central Ayrshire was perfectly right. All of us felt inhibited at our last Sitting. We knew that the later Amendment would come up for discussion and we could refer to it only in passing.

Everyone who has been in the Committee as long as he has knows that no Chairman of a Committee—nor the Chair in the House—would ever stop a Minister saying, "In order to help the progress of the debate, I announce that it is my intention to accept the next Amendment." That would have changed the whole character of the debate and would probably have

That is neither here nor there. The argument we have had these last two mornings is much more important in some areas of Scotland than many hon. Members appear to appreciate. I can understand why so many hon. Members opposite appear to be sitting on the fence. There is a clash of feeling between those who consider the cruelty of the gin trap and those who think of the enormous cruelty which animals do one to another. This is understandable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument of the hon.

The difficulty which hon. Members in this Committee have had is that in dealing with the problem of foxes the amount of available statistics is inevitably extremely limited. The Minister told us at Second Reading that approximately 10,000 foxes had been killed in Scotland in 1965–66. I have no statistical method of knowing what proportion of foxes running amound the countryside are killed. I should guess that at the most it is one in five. If so, there would be some 40,000 to 50,000 foxes alive in Scotland at any given moment. If that is even faintly accurate, hon. Members on both sides of the Committee will see that there
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>60</span>

Friend the Member for Fife, East (Sir J. Gilmour) has spoken of the problems which arose in Australia over the dingo. I have seen exactly the same problem in New Mexico in connection with a different animal. They call it the mountain lion, but it is the puma. Over enormous stretches of wild country keeping of sheep has had to be abandoned altogether because it is impossible in modern conditions, with the high cost of wages and the difficulty of getting workers, to control the mountain lion. The result has been that in the great scattered areas which traditionally
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>62</span>
for many years had been sheep country, sheep had to be abandoned because of the problem of the puma. The right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) told the Committee that in his opinion it is almost inevitable that if man makes a concerted attack on an animal that animal can be got rid of. This has often happened when the animal has value in itself, but I ask him to bear in mind the problem of the common mouse or rat. I will not make any allusions. People have tried for centuries to get rid of these pests, but they have survived with remarkable tenancity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Highlands probably for many-centuries people have tried to get rid of foxes because of their threat to the way of life in that area, but they have not been outstandingly successful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the extent to which the fox and other animals continue to exist is the result of a kind of balance of effort and expenditure against the damage and the threat.

If the extent of the damage increases in the Highlands, which is the nub of the argument, this probably would be met by greater expenditure of energy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to pick that up at the appropriate point in my speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Up to date there has been a good deal of discussion about foxes killing lambs, but we have not the faintest idea of the numbers involved. Somebody quoted a figure of 2,000, but I should not trust that for a second. I have never been asked how many lambs have been killed by foxes in my area. Nor, if I were asked, could I possibly give any sort of accurate estimate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason is perfectly simple. During the lambing period one knows that there are a lot of lambs running around the hills, but when one comes to mark them a month later one finds that there are considerably fewer. Some of them will have been drowned, but many of them will have been picked up by fox dams. Anybody who wanders around the hills will see the bits of 10 or 15 lambs around a fox hole. I cannot put my hand on my heart and say whether the fox concerned killed the lambs and took them
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0441">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>63</span>
there, or whether it found them dead. Even the late Sir Bernard Spilsbury would probably have been puzzled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But there is no doubt that a large number of lambs are killed, and the figure is probably vastly in excess of 2,000. The statistics are simply not available. One can get the figure if a fox comes to the fold and takes lambs, but these are not the conditions which operate in Ross and Cromarty, Caithness, Sutherland, Argyllshire, and Inverness. At times—and this is known by the N.F.U. and the Department—a large number of adult sheep are killed by foxes, besides a large number of hogs, which, for those who are not acquainted with this, are year-old sheep. There was a considerable loss immediately following the outbreak of myxomatosis because the balance of food had been interrupted, and foxes took to killing sheep rather than picking up the odd rabbit, or mouse, or whatever was available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a really serious problem in places which rely very largely on sheep as their main source of income. It therefore seems to me to be important to study—because I was not here for the Second Reading debate—what was said then. I think that it was unworthy of the Minister to accuse my hon. Friend of indulging in junior secondary stuff. The practical people in this Committee know that there is inevitably a certain amount of badinage between both sides, but the Minister is in a different position, because he is stating clearly what is Government policy, or should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I found it puzzling, and that is why to some extent there were so many appeals to get the Minister earlier on Tuesday morning to declare his hand. I found it exceedingly difficult, on reading his speech, to find out, not what he personally felt, but what was Government policy, because there were two definite streams. One was the continued repetition by the Minister, "We are going to abolish the spring trap"; the other was the perfectly clear proviso that it would continue 	<i>ad infinitum</i> unless the Secretary of State decreed otherwise, and those two things were conflicting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said:
	<br><q><p>"We are introducing the Bill basically on humanitarian principles."—[OFFICIAL REPORT,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>64</span>
	<i>Scottish Grand Committee,</i> 26th November, 1968; c. 48.]</p></q>
I have no objection to that. The hon. Gentleman is entitled to bring in the Bill on purely humanitarian principles if he so wishes, but there are many other factors involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The economics of the hill areas is one factor which was rather lightly abandoned. It must be remembered that, in asking the farming community to step up its agricultural production, the Minister of Agriculture asked it to increase sheep production considerably, and said that he intended shifting this industry into the hills—into the jaws of the waiting foxes, one presumes. I make that comment frivolously, but this is a serious matter because the economics of hill farming are very important indeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Everything that has been said by hon. Members on both sides is valid when they have asked how, having changed their position, the Government are now going to occupy their time over the next four years to try to minimise the serious financial loss that could come because of the removal of the gin trap.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel) asked whether I use the gin trap on my farm. I do, and we catch a lot of foxes in it. The traps are, I hope, extremely carefully watched so that they are not left for a long time, and we use them in the most humane way that we can. I accept, of course, that many farmers do not use this trap. indeed—and I am surprised, in some ways—many farmers simply do not know how to use them. It was part of the old shepherd's training to know how to set a gin trap properly, with a little water in the neck to drown the animal caught in the trap. But modern shepherds are not trained in that way, and, therefore, in many areas these traps are not used. Nevertheless, from the evidence given by the Minister, and by others, it is obvious that a high percentage of the foxes killed in the Highland areas are killed by gin traps.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One or two alternative methods have been suggested, and perhaps I might comment on them. My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North (Earl of Dalkeith) talked about creosote being used in the Border areas. This is an extremely good way of keeping off foxes,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0442">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>65</span>
but it involves being able to bring the sheep into parks. This is normal practice in the Border areas, but if the Minister is going to rely on that sort of approach, the bill for creating hill parks into which one can bring lambs will be very large indeed. If it is not done in that way, I do not think anybody will seriously suggest that shepherds should tear around on the open hills trying to catch every lamb and put a little creosote on it. I assure the Minister that it would be totally impossible in Highland conditions at lambing time. It is an effective method, but in the Highlands it would need enormous expenditure on hill parks to make it practicable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that clubs serve some purpose. In my area we have a fox club, and have had for a long time. The farmers pay so much per score or hundred ewes. I was asked to retire gracefully from the club, except an honorary capacity, because it cost the club such a lot to pay my keepers for the number of foxes they killed. It did not stop us going on killing foxes, but it was killing the club. It paid a reasonable bonus per fox, and in those days we killed a great many more foxes than in the whole of the rest of the Cowal put together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If these clubs are to be effective, again this will be fairly expensive, because if they have to pay large bonuses it is an expensive operation to have enough keepers all the year round to get rid of the foxes. The idea is possible, but, if the scheme is to be self-balancing, on a sheep farm it would come to the equivalent of 2s. or 3s. a ewe if the club were to be satisfactory. There are possibilities of going in this direction, but if it is to be done the Government will have to put a great deal of money into making certain that it is effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole problem of trying to get a better trap, or a more effective method of getting rid of foxes, needs, and perhaps could well be done by granting, a subvention from the Government. If I am right, I suspect that the fox is causing well over £100,000 worth of damage a year to the agricultural industry as a whole, and it would be worth offering a really substantial prize, or spending a really substantial amount of money on research, to find the right way of dealing with this problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>66</span>
If the Minister is keen to justify what I believe was a serious change in direction in this Bill, and which was announced on Tuesday, he ought to be able to tell us what he is going to follow this up with. The Minister said:
	<br><q><p>"I shall make sure that the implications for destruction clubs of the ban on the use of the gin trap—"</p></q>
and here again we have these words—
	<br><q><p>"we certainly intend to abolish it—are taken into account before any decision."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Scottish Grand Committee;</i> 26th November 1968, c. 48.]</p></q>
Have the implications been taken into account in making this decision? The hon. Gentleman has not told us anything about it. It will make this whole concept very much more acceptable to those hon. Members who are interested mainly in this on humanitarian grounds, and will make it slightly less totally unacceptable to those of us who were born and brought up in the hills and care about what happens to the sheep as well as to the foxes, if the Minister comes clean and says what the Government intend to do to protect us from what is a really serious menace in those areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I asked the right hon. Gentleman whether he used the gin trap, and he admitted that he did. I recognise that he cannot speak for his hon. Friends who are engaged in farming, and that it is for them to admit whether or not they use this cruel method of killing foxes when there are alternative methods of controlling foxes. I know a fairly large number of sheep farmers who do not use the gin trap, yet they control the fox menace as effectively as those who do. I do not think the right hon. Gentleman would disagree with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fox population has multiplied in the Highlands since the decline of gamekeepers. The number of gamekeepers has dropped remarkably over the years. It may be that estates are not rich enough to employ them, but in certain areas where at one time, half a dozen gamekeepers used to be employed, not one is to be found nowadays, or there may be just one keeper whose main duty is not the destruction of foxes, but that of looking after a lucrative stretch of salmon water to make certain that the Highland people residing in that area do not snitch the odd

salmon. But the original duties of controlling vermin are not being carried out today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a possibility that in many areas not enough labour is employed by the farmers. We see too many dead animals lying unburied. This should not happen. If that happens, I can imagine gin traps left unattended or not looked at for many weeks. Therefore, this becomes a crueller thing than many of us thought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a growth of fox clubs because the number of gamekeepers employed has dropped so much over the years. There were no fox clubs when the Highlands were employing gamekeepers to the extent they did when I was a young man. I never heard of fox clubs in those days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Vermin have increased. I want to put on record that the responsibility lies on landowning interests not employing the gamekeepers who used to keep the foxes under control along with other vermin. We have heard a suggestion from the hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) that the Government should pay £5 a brush to make up the leeway for the evasion by landowning interests in not controlling foxes. I think that that money should come from nearer home, out of purses otner than the common purse. This argument is much too often used to evade responsibilities that should be private, not public.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate has gone on for a long time, and perhaps it should. I am surprised that hon. Members opposite, who have said that up to now the main weakness of the Bill was its indecision, should have chosen to make such a splash about a fairly minor change which was entirely in harmony with its basic principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Hannan) quite correctly said that I might have been drawn up for tedious repetition. But why was the necessity for tedious repetition? Time and time again in the debate on consideration of principle I had to make it repetitively clear, because hon. Members were challenging the validity of what I was saying, that we intended to abolish the gin trap in 1973. They said, "But you leave it open under Clause
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>68</span>
2(1)(	<i>b</i>). Therefore, you do not intend to abolish it in 1973". This was the need, and so I plead guilty to tedious repetition. I had to make it clear that this was the date we intended, and that only in abnormal circumstances did we consider there would be any possible need for deferment. As I say, I had to repeat that time and again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart), for whom I have the greatest respect—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He has none for my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—especially when I think with whom else he is sharing the Opposition Front Bench today, said, quite rightly I think, that I had had a mauling over this point. I could quote the point that the hon. Gentleman made. He said that
	<br><q><p>"this is a point which made a very much more severe impact upon the Committee, to postpone the withdrawal of the Secretary of State's powers indefinitely. On Second Reading Clause 2(1)(b) got a pretty substantial mauling. Through these Amendments we seek to be much more positive and practical."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 10th December, 1968; c. 5.]</p></q>
The hon. Gentleman was referring to his own Amendments. When we follow his instruction and avoid the indecision and are eminently positive and practical, he accuses me of lack of truth and honesty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. Just a moment. The right hon. Gentleman has said enough and more than enough for the high office which he once held. There used to be a principle in Rome when accusations of dishonesty were made: 	<i>cui bono?</i>—for whose good?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us examine this. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison), for whom also I have the greatest respect, said that he was disappointed, and that, if he had known what I intended to do about the Amendment, he would at least have been saved some heartburning during the discussions on Tuesday. I. too, would have been saved a great deal of heartburning. It did me no good that I did not refer to the following Amendment. We could have cut through a great deal of the discussion on Tuesday, and I know where the hon. Gentleman's allegiance would have lain on this matter, because I know

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>69</span>
how firm are his convictions and beliefs on this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why did not the hon. Gentleman do it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because, rightly or wrongly, it has been a basic principle of democracy that arguments are heard before decisions are taken. Are hon. Members opposite, particularly the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble), a former Secretary of State for Scotland, now saying that when Amendments are brought to the Floor of the House or Committee the arguments should not be considered before people's minds are made up? Is this the democratic principle—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just a moment. Is this the democratic principle that is being enunciated? I do not think that I should preempt decisions. Furthermore, this is my position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just a moment. This argument—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is long, tedious and stupid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This argument that I have been dishonest must fall, and I hope that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South recognises it. It would have been easier for me to make a decision earlier and get it through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman is keen to come, is he not? I hope that on this occasion it will not be a repetition of the kind of prep school juvenile abuse to which we have been listening for most of the morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the extraordinary courtesy which the Minister, as usual, displays. He talks about prep school nonsense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. Juvenile abuse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does not need him to tell the Committee how to behave, because the hon. Gentleman, twice in the last three minutes, has totally misrepresented what was said: totally. First, he suggested that I said that Ministers should not listen to arguments before they answered them. I said no such thing. I said that Ministers traditionally have helped Committees, where there was a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>70</span>
considerable argument, by saying what their policy was and, therefore, avoiding prolonging the argument. I never made any statement that the Minister should not listen to the argument. I come back to what the hon. Gentleman believes is his great honesty in suddenly announcing this decision. When he discussed the Bill with the N.F.U., did he or did he not tell the N.F.U. and the sheep interests that he intended to bring in a change to the Bill—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: —that altered what he had said was to be in it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to look into this. My recollection is that this point was put. I will have this point looked into. I certainly indicated it informally, but I should like to know whether it was done formally. The answer, which I now have, is that the National Farmers Union has been told. [HON. MEMBERS: "When?"] We only made the change of decision this week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the right hon. Gentleman saying that the Government should always wait for the decision of groups outside the House before making decisions? The right hon. Gentleman has not understood my argument about listening to arguments. Of course, he did not say that. He would not do so. However, he does not understand the implications of some of his own arguments, and I must dismiss most of his contributions over the last two days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, West is a different kettle of fish. I understand the seriousness with which he approaches this matter. His argument deserves repect. I understand the reasons why he feels I have behaved unworthily. I think that it is the first time that the hon. Gentleman has used language like this towards me. I believe that he feels that on this occasion my behaviour was unworthy of my own past, because I think that he has respected the way we have conducted our controversies previously. I thought that I had made it clear, in intervention after intervention throughout the debate on principle and throughout the first Sitting of this Committee, that we envisaged 1973 as the date, and that only in abnormal circumstances would this be altered. The hon. Gentleman attacked the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0445">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>71</span>
indecision. He praised some of my hon. Friends who said that we would postpone it to the year 2,000, and so on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us have no misunderstanding. The trend of my objection was solely because of the waste of time in Committee if those powers already existed. Many hon. Members attacked Clause 2(1)(	<i>b</i>) on the basis of whether it was necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand this. But, having established that it was necessary, it became a different argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry to work like a Schoolman. It is no great joy for me. I would rather be discussing the principle, but I must put up a defence because of the headline hunting that we have had from the right hon. Member for Argyll. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, West said:
	<br><q><p>"In view of that. I should say that this Bill contributes absolutely nothing. The firm date of termination is not the date four years hence; it can be extended, it can be brought forward. It can be determined a year hence now. because no period of time is prescribed in the Pests Act; the Minister has only to be satisfied that a suitable alternative is available. It is absurd to say that by giving this limited extension a year at a time over and over the Government are now moving towards the elimination of the use of gin traps."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Scottish Grand Committee,</i> 26th November, 1968; c. 11–12.]</p></q>
If this is not an objection to the fact that we are not moving to the abolition of gin traps by putting in a date, I do not know what it means. It was made clear from the beginning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no regrets about what I have done. I think that it was correct. We intend to abolish the gin trap in 1973. It seemed to me then and it seems to me now to be impeccably correct intellectually to say that that kind of flexibility should be brought in. Hon. Members on both sides have made it clear throughout the debate that they regarded the greatest weakness as being the absence of a clear termination date. We have put in a clear termination date, and I hope the Committee will approve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon. Gentleman feels rather strongly that the language I used about him was not justified. I feel that I was being particularly courteous in view of what I feel about his behaviour. That is neither
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>72</span>
here not there. Hon. and right hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have asked, in the course of this morning's debate, that the Government should tell them what action they propose to take to deal with a serious problem that will certainly arise in three or four years' time. Not a single word was said by the Minister to all the very serious points raised on this problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I make a brief intervention?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. Could I, through you, Sir Myer, make an appeal to the Committee that we do not allow our good manners to deteriorate to the extent they have today. We should remember that Members are right hon. and hon. Members on both sides, and that these terms of abuse are not worthy of the Scottish Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point has been made. I hope that hon. and right hon. Members will pay some heed to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have used no terms of abuse. As to the argument which has been put forward, I was deliberately waiting for the Question, That the Clause stand part of the Bill, which seemed the obvious point at which to discuss it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sir Myer, may I on behalf of the Committee, thank you for taking the Chair? If it seemed that the arguments got a little rough, and that some things said from a sedentary position, as happens in the Scottish Committee, were not as peaceful as always, I am sure you took it as no disrespect to the Chair. We are grateful for the way that you took it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I add my thanks to the Chair? Any heat which has been engendered has not come from the Chair. I think that the Chair has behaved with great equanimity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
