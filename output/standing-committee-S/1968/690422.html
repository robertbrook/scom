	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. N. R. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 107, in page 5, line 31, after "him", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"and after consulting the Countryside Commission for Scotland",</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think it would be for the convenience of the Committee to discuss with this Amendment, Amendment No. 108, in page 6, line 11, after "but", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"subject to the provisions of subsection (1) above ".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This proposition has been canvassed in more general terms at an earlier stage of our proceedings. This Amendment is an attempt to ascertain with a little more definition than we were favoured with before exactly what are the Government's intentions in regard to the co-ordination of planning authorities, in the exercise of their duties in respect of structure plans, and the Countryside Commission for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the 1967 Act the Countryside Commission, in a sense, has fairly wide planning functions. The kind of things which the Countryside Commission has to take into account are planning considerations in many instances. It has certain statutory functions specifically in regard to planning matters. These are set out in Section 8 of the Countryside (Scotland) Act. Subsection (1) of that Section provides:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Commission may, and if so requested by the Secretary of State or any local planning authority shall, advise the Secretary of State or, as the case may be, the authority, in relation to any matter arising under the Planning Acts which affects land in the countryside."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>146</span>
The Countryside Commission has discretionary powers to give advice either to the Secretary of State or local planning authorities, and a statutory obligation to give that advice if it is requested either by the Secretary of State or by a local planning authority. It is perfectly clear that when dealing with structure plans there will be an overlapping of functions, because the structure plan in a county area will very likely—indeed, almost inevitably—impinge on the jurisdiction and responsibilities of the Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State has to designate certain areas as countryside areas before the Commission comes into play. We would all be interested to know if the Minister of State could give us some idea of the extent to which the Secretary of State has proceeded with the responsibilities imposed on him under that Act. I imagine that, by this time, considerable progress has been made by the Secretary of State in designating areas for the purposes of the 1967 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it be the case, as it seems to be, that there is an overlapping of functions here, and in the structure plan field, it is difficult to envisage circumstances in which the Secretary of State and/or the local planning authority would not wish to consult the Countryside Commission. There may be a case for writing into the legislation an obligation, rather than leaving it to the looser terms of the 1967 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What happens if the local planning authority does not choose to consult the Countryside Commission? There is no statutory obligation on it at the moment to do so. This Amendment does not seek to make it so, but at some stage there should be a statutory provision for consultation, and if that stage is not to be an early stage, when the matter is in the hands of the planning authority, one would expect it to be appropriate for such consultation to take place when the structure plan is being considered by the Secretary of State. That precisely is what the Amendment seeks. Under the 1967 Act it is not obligatory on the Secretary of State to consult the Countryside Commission, but he has a discretion to do so. If he does so, of course the Commission has a statutory duty to comply and to give him the advice he seeks. The Amendment seeks to say that when the Secretary of State is considering a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0900">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>147</span>
structure plan submitted to him or re-submitted he must consult the Countryside Commission before taking a decision. I think he would almost inevitably do that in any case, but it would be better to face the fact that in effect he will have to do this. This should be recognised in the legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. A. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that we shall not clutter up the Bill with all sorts of bodies which should be consulted. I am a member of the Historic Buildings Society. That is entitled to be asked by the Secretary of State for advice. Much of this planning involves buildings which are listed for preservation, and in many cases we would require to be consulted. To some extent the National Trust might have reason to be consulted in certain areas. There is no evidence that the Secretary of State will have to consult the Countryside Commission in every case. There may be cases where that does not arise, but if we put in this provision we are taking an unnecessary step when it should be possible for the planning authority and the Secretary of State to get on with the job. The Secretary of State is responsible both for the Countryside Commission and for the overall decisions about planning in Scotland. One of the advantages is that he can co-ordinate these things under his powers. The hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) has agreed that such powers already exist. I think it would be a disadvantage to put into the Bill the name of one body because then there would be a legal presumption that all the other bodies would be excluded. It would be very bad if the impression were given that only the Countryside Commission is to be consulted. Because there is a much more general power and duty on the Secretary of State to consult all interested parties, we should not tie this to consultation with the Countryside Commission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am rather disappointed with the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie). I am one who sits at his feet trying to promote my understanding of the world of law. I expected to hear from him this morning a well-knit, cogently argued legal case for the inclusion of these words in the Clause, but what did I hear? A lot
	<span class='label label-info column'>148</span>
of waffle about the Countryside Commission. He was struggling to make a case. That case could be made only by struggling, because there is no reason to put in these words. These words would be a nuisance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Suppose Edinburgh Corporation sent its structure plan to the Secretary of State and it were then said that the Secretary of State must consult the Countryside Commission. The Countryside Commission has very little to do with Edinburgh Corporation and Edinburgh. Suppose Glasgow sent in its structure plan. I cannot understand the Commission saying, "We shall sweep away this and make vast parks and recreational spaces in this area". This provision is quite unnecessary. As my right hon. Friend the Member for East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn) said, if this legal obligation is placed on the Secretary of State, almost inevitably it would have to be placed in relation to other societies which, to Edinburgh, would be much more appropriate than the Countryside Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think the hon. and learned Member did himself justice. I have great respect for him. I hope that, having heard two excellent speeches from this side of the Committee, he will see that the wise course would be to withdraw his Amendment. We would respect him as a result.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to intervene at this stage of the debate but the words spoken by the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) have brought me to my feet. Up to the point on which he spoke I confess that although I was quite impressed by the argument of my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie), I did not think it was quite so necessary to have this Amendment as he suggested. The words of the right hon. Member raised in my mind fears which I now see rightly animated by my hon. and learned Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is suggested that someone, such as the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East, might one day be in charge of affairs at the Scottish Office and have before him from the City of Edinburgh a structure plan and that he might say that the plan could not possibly be the concern of the Countryside Commission. I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0901">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>149</span>
am sure my hon and learned Friend, and my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison), would agree that it is quite wrong to think that the City of Edinburgh excludes every possible part of the countryside which might be involved with the Commission. It was this that my hon. and learned Friend was trying to avoid when asking that we should write these words into the Clause, to prevent someone such as the right hon. Member from saying glibly, "This is a city, and it could not involve the Countryside Commission."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Member think that the council for the preservation of Scottish buildings is much more important in the activities of Edinburgh, than the Countryside Commission?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a perfectly arguable point, but we are not discussing whether or not the Council for Historic Buildings or the National Trust should be included. We are discussing whether the Countryside Commission should be included. Another point, which the right hon. Gentleman may not have appreciated, is that whereas the Countryside Commission is a statutory body the other bodies are not statutory bodies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is mistaken. The Historic Buildings Council is a statutory body.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am corrected on that. I was thinking of the National Trust, which is not a statutory body. Although I am sure they would be consulted on any matter affecting Edinburgh, I can see that there is an argument for saying that they should not be specifically written into the Bill, but that is not true in the case of the Countryside Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When taking this Amendment further, or possibly moving a similar one later, my hon. and learned Friend might consider that if we are to include the Countryside Commission, as I think we should, and have it consulted as of right when all structure plans are approved, it would also be right for the Highlands and Islands Development Board to have a right to be consulted on any structure plans involving an Highland area concerned. Those two bodies have a very special and essential interest in matters of structure plans, whereas the other
	<span class='label label-info column'>150</span>
bodies mentioned do not have such an essential interest, although they have a close and real interest. If my hon. and learned Friend's suggestion were accepted, there would be nothing done which we do not all want to be done anyway, and the Countryside Commission, which is trying to do a good job throughout the whole of Scotland, would at least have an absolute assurance that no structure plan would be passed, even if it were for the City of Edinburgh, without its being consulted as of right. This is a very good suggestion, and I hope that the Minister of State will accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archie Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to enter into this debate, but after the contribution from my neighbour from Ayr (Mr. Younger) I feel that I have to say something in reply, because when we who are experienced in planning debates, both in local government and in Parliament, get a young fellow jumping in at the deep end and getting out of his depth, we try to rescue him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) was a bit sweeping in his condemnation of the contribution of the hon. and learned Gentleman——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was not condemnation. It was really a feeling of sorrow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am having great difficulty in hearing the hon. Member's argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am getting too much support, Mr. Brewis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point I want to make is that I thought the hon. and learned Gentleman possibly moved this Amendment as a probing Amendment. I am very keen on the provisions for the Countryside Commission, and many of us took part in debates on this subject, but the point made by my right hon. Friend the Member for East Stirlingshire (Mr. Wood-burn) and by my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East, shows that we would create an anomaly if we lifted the Countryside Commission into this rather superior position. Possibly we have been talking without scrutinising the Clause as we ought to have done. Subsection (2) gives all the protection that is necessary, because it reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In considering any such pian the Secretary of State may take into account any
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0902">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>151</span>
matters which he thinks are relevant, whether or not they were taken into account in the plan as submitted to him."</p></blockquote>
If the Secretary of State and his officials operate that provision, then, obviously, they must look at the commitments of all other statutory bodies in Scotland in connection with any structure plan. I have often been critical of Parliamentary draftsmen, but on this occasion subsection (2) has taken cognisance of the fears raised by hon. Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a very interesting argument, but can the hon. Gentleman tell us what would happen if his right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis), were the Secretary of State? He has already stated that it would not be appropriate to refer a structure plan for Edinburgh to the Countryside Commission. How does that fit in?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is much too hypothetical a question to envisage. However, I think that subsection (2) covers the position, and I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister of State will concur in that argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Dempsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have liked to have heard some mention of the voluntary organisations, because all we have heard is that the Secretary of State should consult the statutory bodies, bodies appointed by the Secretary of State, bodies which have the umbrella of Government authority. That is rather surprising, because only recently I heard the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) making a plea on the Floor of the House for voluntary effort—in connection with the Territorial Army. Voluntary effort is very important. After all, what is wrong with the country at the present moment is that there are too few people giving voluntary effort. There are far too many organisations and individuals looking for payment, for salaries, for whatever contribution they make towards the society which we in this building represent at the present time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Will the hon. Member please bring his argument back to the Countryside Commission? It is much too general for this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dempsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, I heard Ancient Monuments Eoard and the Historic Building Council being brought
	<span class='label label-info column'>152</span>
into this debate, and they are not in the Amendment or in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Up to now the argument has been completely in order, but the hon. Member must come on to the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dempsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the greatest respect, Mr. Brewis, the argument at present is as to whether we should incorporate in this Bill a requirement compelling the Secretary of State to consult the Countryside Commission. This has been followed up by the argument that the Ancient Monuments Board should also be consulted. That was regarded as in order, so I thought I was entitled to argue that we should consult the Archeological Society, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I explain the position to the hon. Member? He will be in order in putting forward this argument on the Question, That the Clause stand part of the Bill, but not on this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dempsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am willing to accept your Ruling, Mr. Brewis, but in view of the fact that the debate had been widened, I thought it was in order that I widen it even further. However, I shall endeavour to restrict my discussion to the narrow limits which you have now set in connection with the Countryside Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel that in matters of this nature it is wise to leave a Secretary of State with a certain degree of discretion, because if he is a good Secretary of State and a good planning officer he will consult the Countryside Commission and any other organisations which he thinks can make a substantial contribution towards preserving and improving the amenities of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Dr. J. Dickson Mabon)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am embarrassed by the abundance of riches that I have on my side this morning, and I am substantially with the arguments which have been adduced by my hon. Friends. I though that the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) rather entrapped himself in accepting that, at least, there was an arguable case for a reference to the Historic Buildings Council for Scotland. Edinburgh undoubtedly has a very great concern about this, and I imagine that any corporation which advanced any
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0903">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>153</span>
proposition without having consulted the Historic Buildings Council, or even the Royal Fine Art Commission, was not being fair either to its citizens or to the Secretary of State. Incidentally, may I say that the Royal Fine Art Commission is not a statutory body, although it has a Royal Warrant? On the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge and Airdrie (Mr. Dempsey), about there being other bodies, not necessarily statutory bodies, which it would be quite sensible to consult in certain cases, it is the argument of flexibility that we are having to choose from this morning and there are a number of other side issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the classic argument that if we nominated the Countryside Commission we should thereby imply that, since we had not put in other people, they are in a second-class category at best, and can be ignored at worst. We have had time and time again, and I am sure it will come up in this Committee on later Bills, the argument, 	<i>Inclusio unius exclu sio alterius</i>. If one is named, then why not name the others? Why not include them all? The Nature Conservancy was mentioned at the second sitting by my hon. Friend the Member for Motherwell (Mr. Lawson), and there are a number of other bodies. Under Regulations at the present time, in the case of a development plan, the Secretary of State asks authorities to remember the position of agricultural executive committees—which have not so far been mentioned—and the National Coal Board, and, expressly in Statute, there is a requirement about adjoining local planning authorities. That is a perfectly valid point, but to start to name each one is an error.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the sense of the argument which the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) has advanced. We are here talking about the Secretary of State's powers or obligations. But I hope we are remembering that when a local planning authority goes through the proper procedures it will if it is a sensible one, have taken into account the different views of these other bodies and will have consulted them. The Secretary of State then looks not only at the plans presented to him, but also at what has gone before, and it should be remembered that he has an interest in the earlier stages. If he thinks that an
	<span class='label label-info column'>154</span>
authority has been negligent about consulting various bodies, or that they have just been forgotten, or if he wants specific advice from one body or another, then he can ask for this. It is true that in statute, he is not in every case obliged to get this advice from the proper body, because some are not statutory bodies. The essential point is that the Secretary of State has here a power, while the Amendment would make it an obligation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not the case that all the bodies which find they have an interest which has perhaps been neglected have a right to send their views to the Secretary of State on a subject of this kind?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Dickson Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, and I am trying to say to the Committee that, while I accept absolutely the position of the Countryside Commission, and its need to make comment to the City of Edinburgh or any other part of Scotland, I do not wish to accept the Amendment because it might imply that the Secretary of State did not have the same regard for many other authorities, some of which are not statutory bodies. In other words, to use a medical metaphor, the Bill is a physiological Bill in as much as it has life and flexibility and growth in it, but the Amendment is anatomical in that it confines to one piece of firm anatomy one obligation and says nothing about the rest. That is an error.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill as it stands is flexible. It provides for proper consultation with the Countryside Commission, and the regulations could so provide if the hon. Gentleman insists that it must be mentioned. But it does so without disrespect to any other body than the Countryside Commission. If the Committee felt that we had to mention the Countryside Commission, the Government would have to give serious consideration at Report stage to a very long list of other bodies which we should have to add. Not only that; we should have set a precedent for future legislation, that in every case where consultation has to take place these bodies must all be prescribed. That would be a grave error, because I assure the Committee that on some occasions we would not make an exhaustive list. In other words, we would create a grievance in trying to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0904">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>155</span>
correct a grievance, and mat would be an error.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I strongly advise the Committee that, while every one of us agrees with the importance of the Countryside Commission and its proper place in the functioning of this Bill, it would be wrong to include it as in this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are grateful for the observations from both sides of the Committee, and I am particularly grateful for the complimentary remarks made by the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis), whose views on these matters, drafting matters particularly, I always treat with the highest regard, because he has an uncanny knack of sometimes putting his finger on a rather delicate point that misses most of us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not at all happy about the Minister's reply. One recognises the importance of 	<i>inclusio unius exclusio alterius</i>; it is always a dangerous thing to pick out one body and mention it if there are a substantial number of other bodies which could equally well qualify for this special treatment. This is the argument which has been adduced against mentioning the Countryside Commission. But the Commission is a very special case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is in a different position, even from the Highlands and Islands Development Board, which is not merely a planning authority. The Commission has positive planning functions and it was deemed necessary and advisable to put into the Countryside Act that there will be an obligation on this body to give advice, either to local authorities or the Secretary of State, when asked to do so. For these reasons it seemed to us that the Countryside Commission is in so special a position that one could properly and without reflection on other statutory or non-statutory bodies with an interest in planning matters, and without prejudice, mention the Countryside Commission by name.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East referred to Edinburgh. The classic case of the function of the Countryside Commission in relation to a structure plan for the Edinburgh region would have been that stretch of hillside in my constituency, the Pentland Hills. The Committee may remember that about two
	<span class='label label-info column'>156</span>
years ago we had difficulty in that area with the Ministry of Defence. It was just when the Countryside Bill was going through the Committee. I recollect it being said that that stretch of countryside, in close proximity to urban development, was just the kind of area which would properly be designated a countryside area. Edinburgh is a good example of a structure plan which would involve the advice of the Countryside Commission, where an area has been designated as countryside, and I was hoping that the Minister might have given some rough idea as to how he is getting on with the designation of countryside areas. It is inconceivable that the Secretary of State would not consult the Countryside Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no strong views on this, because I appreciate that it is always dangerous to mention one statutory body when there are others which would have an interest, but I would have thought there was a case for mentioning the Countryside Commission in the Bill because of its peculiar position in town and country planning. Despite the view expressed by the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East I do not feel disposed to withdraw the Amendment because it seems that there is an arguable case for this particular statutory body.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed.</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This Clause imposes the statutory duty on the Secretary of State to consider the structure plan submitted, or resubmitted, to him and under the provisions of subsection (1) he may either approve the plan in whole or in part or reject it. What is the position with regard to objections to the plan? I notice in subsection (3) that the Secretary of State has to
	<br><blockquote><p>"consider objections … so far as they are made in accordance with regulations under this Part of this Act",</p></blockquote>
and he must also
	<br><blockquote><p>"… afford to persons whose objections so made are not withdrawn an opportunity …"</p></blockquote>
of stating those objections. Do we understand that there will be provision made by regulation for the whole matter of hearing objections to structure plans and inquiries into objections to structure plans, because I am not sure whether
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0905">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>157</span>
there is anything in the Clause making provision for this?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister tell us how the structure plan phase is expected to work out? Is it expected that there will be only a minimal opposition to the structure plan, and is it expected that the real crunch in planning will come only at the local plan stage, or, conversely, does he feel that the real objection will come at the structure plan phase, when decisions in principle are taken, and that that, to a large extent, will supersede the likelihood of objections at the local plan stage, if there is such a stage?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that view is that opposition to the structure plan is not anticipated to any great degree, I hope that he will bear in mind some of the criticisms made in Committee about the action area part of the structure plan. That is a feature of the structure plan which has caused, and is causing, some concern, because unless there is some definition as to what is comprehended in the action area it is likely, or possible, that unnecessary opposition will be generated simply because people are not sure whether they will be affected. We are dealing with a new type of plan, which the Secretary of State is being asked to approve or reject. We would not like to see the Clause leave us without some elaboration of the kind of matters I have mentioned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What does the Minister feel the position of the statutory undertakers will be in relation to the structure plan? So often we say, for instance, "We will have a steel works here" and then forget that to bring power to it will create a great deal of inconvenience, with pylons and so on. Is it at this stage, in the structure plan stage, that it will be subject to approval by the Secretary of State, or does the Minister feel it is more likely to be involved in the local plan? This goes for the Gas Board, British Rail, and the Ministry of Defence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The statutory undertakers have to operate, the Ministry of Defence in particular. We need national defence of the highest order, but, frequently, what the Ministry alone says goes. There, for example, are astonishing things such as the N.A.T.O. radar set-up across that beautiful part of the Solway in Cumberland; there are dozens of enormous pylons, which I am
	<span class='label label-info column'>158</span>
sure are highly important to the defence of the country. The local planning authority would not have had much say in the siting of those. It has just had to take place. Does the Minister visualise these problems of the statutory undertakers being dealt with at the structure plan stage, or are they more likely to come in with the local plans, under Clause 6?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) has raised a very important point, to do with the structure plan and spoliation. Necessary though this may be for certain purposes, there is already blight in the countryside. Does the structure plan take cognisance of this as something which should be prohibited?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have to think things through. At present there is great pressure to electrify the railway from Crewe to Glasgow. We want this, but has anyone thought that to do it we will have to bring in a great deal of power? Has anyone thought of the power lines which will be needed in Scotland and Cumberland to carry out electrification? I am not sure that we are thinking things through. We say, rightly, that we will have an aluminium smelter at Inver-gordon, but have we thought of the complications in the years to come, with provisions for servicing? I want to know whether at the structure plan stage, or the local plan stage, the statutory undertakers will have their recommendations scrutinised carefully.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the Minister one question for the purpose of clarification? Could he give the Committee any idea how long the Secretary of State may sit on a structure plan before giving his approval? There seems to be no indication as to the time limits which may be imposed by the Secretary of State. I ask this question rather specifically in the context of possible planning blight which may arise, because, as we all know, a plan may be drawn up by a local authority and it may cause blight; and we may wait six months, a year, or even five years before the Secretary of State gives his decision. I wonder whether the Minister could give us some indication as to how his mind is running on this, and whether he thinks there may be a time limit for the Secretary of State to give his answer. I do not know whether
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0906">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>159</span>
it is in order to bring this up at this stage, but structure plans are possibly the cause of planning blight. It is difficult to separate this part of the Bill from the second part dealing specifically with it. I gather that this would be out of order, from the shaking of your head, Mr. Brewis. However, could the Minister say how long the Secretary of State will sit on structure plans before he produces his answer?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To take the last point first, this is a matter of administration rather than of writing anything into the Bill. It is impossible for any Minister to anticipate the maximum time that would be required to consider, with his Department, all the consultations we have discussed earlier before making a final decision. Many people tend to forget that once a public inquiry has closed and part I has been circulated, there is a time when the reporter writes part II. That is never known to the public. They are never aware when part II is submitted. I do not know whether the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) has ever written a part II; but, after it has been submitted, the Secretary of State has to consider it. The Secretary of State is often blamed for the time taken between the closing of a public inquiry and the decision, when it may have happened that the Secretary of State was expeditious with his decision, having got a much delayed part II. There may be good reasons for having to write a closely argued and circumspect report for the Secretary of State's benefit. Later on the decision is published and people see it, but it does not follow that the general blame on the Secretary of State is entirely his. People just do not appreciate that. I do not wish to go into particular cases, but I can assure the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North (Earl of Dalkeith) that since I have been at the Scottish Office we have gone to considerable lengths to make sure that the time between receipt of the final documentation and the decision is as short as is humanly possible, taking into account the fact that we have to consult a number of other Government Departments to get a proper assessment of the Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the point that it is wrong that it should be a lengthy period. Five years
	<span class='label label-info column'>160</span>
takes my breath away. I have been involved in one particularly difficult inquiry, which went on for a year and a half. The people concerned were very angry about it, and they did not understand all the circumstances until the decision letter and all the facts became known. Then their antagonism towards the Secretary of State fell away, because they realised what a difficult problem he had had to referee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an administrative matter which we could not, with good sense, put into the Bill. We would hobble the Secretary of State to a point where he would become inefficient by having to make a decision within a specified time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to go into the question of statutory undertakers just now. I am sure, Mr. Brewis, you would want us to leave that till we reach Clause 68, and in particular Clauses 69, 70, 71 and 72. Statutory undertakers are in the same position as any other body in that they are required to get planning permission. I take the point made by the hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) not only about defence, but about economic developments, such as electrifying a railway line, which we should all like to see done reasonably soon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answer to the first major point raised by the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands is that we would, under Clause 13, make such regulations. We are not specifying this in the Clause for reasons that I tried to adduce on Clause 3 when there was a suggestion that I might make a reference to regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the hon. and learned Gentleman's second major point about what we think is likely to happen at this stage, whether we will get minimal opposition at the structure plan stage, it is difficult to say. It depends on the size of the plan, the area covered, and the nature of what is proposed. If the authority were doing its publicity and presenting its case well and with some conviction, a lot of misunderstandings would disappear and a lot of the formal objectors who are there, not because they are objecting but because they want to know what is happening, would not be present at the stage we are now discussing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the structure plan goes forward to the Secretary of State,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0907">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>161</span>
as well as looking ahead and foreshadowing proper planning in future for whatever development may take place, will it show where irretrievable mistakes have been made that cannot be removed and those which could be removed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As far as possible, yes. Knowing my hon. Friend, I am sure that he has something in mind, but I cannot anticipate what it is. It is reasonable that the structure plan might point out where certain developments had taken place which were not capable of adjustment. It could also demonstrate where others literally changed the face of a particular part of the area. This is right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To come back to the point made by the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands about minimal disturbance, I think that it would vary according to the area and the scale of the proposals being made. If the Clyde Valley Planning Advisory Committee had been a planning authority proposing a structure plan it would have had to spend a great deal longer than we have in reading the Metra report and would have had a great deal of argument with different people before it ever came to the Secretary of State. In other words, it would have been the largest structure plan in Scotland and probably one of the most hotly contested. Even with the most carefully argued case prepared in the best possible way by the sponsors, it would not have had minimal disturbance or friction. It would have been a hotly contested matter at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that the local plan is difficult. We come to this in later Clauses about the chiming in of the local plan and the structure plan. This raises again the question of blight. The structure plan is painted on a large canvas, and, to my mind, will probably cause less trouble in terms of argument and of convincing people of its need than some of the action areas and some of the local plans. Once we get to the local plan stage we are arguing plot by plot, street by street, and area by area, and we are then in trouble. Hon. Members who have had local authority experience of planning committees know that 90 per cent. of their work is spent on matters of minor planning significance, while the large, real issues can take up only 5 or 10 per cent. of their time. It is sad that it
	<span class='label label-info column'>162</span>
should be so, because the planning committee has to plan on a large canvas, and it is not fair to burden it with minor matters. I know some planning conveners who spend three or four days dealing with what are basically minor issues of planning, although they are very important to individuals. At the local plan stage we shall probably get maximum unavoidable trouble in trying to settle issues between the authority and individuals, not at the structure plan stage. However, it is important that the publicity should be done well, although we are trying to reduce the areas of argument between people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that the Clause is considered important and that the Opposition would like to see it taken in with the rest of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister of State for answering my question so fully. We would all agree that timing cannot be written into the Bill. The whole Committee will agree that the minimum time spent by the Secretary of State considering or approving a plan is desirable, but this raises the important question of staffing in the Scottish Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I imagine that there will be a considerable increase in the number of plans coming before the Scottish Office. I wonder how much of an increase in staff the Minister visualises may be necessary if those plans are to be considered and dealt with expeditiously. I do not know whether he has made any precise calculations about the percentage increase. I do not know what staff the Minister has in his Department at the moment, or whether he has made any precise calculation of how many extra people he may need. Planning is a particular science, and throughout the country there is a shortage of planners with expertise. I think that liaison with the universities may possibly be the answer to ensure that there is a sufficient flow of new recruits into the necessary Departments and branches, of which the Scottish Office undoubtedly will be one. If the Minister could give us an indication of the increase in staff which may be necessary it would be helpful to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North (Earl of Dalkeith) about staffing. We on this side are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0908">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>163</span>
anxious that the Development Department should play as big a part in planning as possible. We shall oppose certain proposals about leaving the last word with the local planning committees for that reason, because we respect and admire the work of that Department. We must bear in mind that when the Act, as it will become, gets off the ground it will presumably be in an entirely different local government context. With the groupings of local authorities into groupings which will be capable of operating the structure plan concept there may be a saving of skilled personnel by reducing the multiplicity of planning authorities, where we all agree there is already a staffing problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister mentioned action area designation. There is to be a local plan for the action area, and we understand that that will not necessarily be produced concurrently with the structure plan. Is there not a danger that opposition will be generated at the structure plan phase, which includes action area designation, because of the lack of definition of the action area? Whether there is such opposition or not, presumably there would have to be a public inquiry into the action area plan, which is to take the form set out in Fig. 3 of the Planning Advisory Group's Report. Then follows the local plan in the proper sense of the term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, that means that there may be objections to the structure plan because people are not sure whether they will be affected, and, secondly, there will perhaps be a more detailed and bitterly fought objection to the action area local plan. I presume—perhaps the Minister can confirm this—that there would have to be public inquiries into the structure plan and also into the action area local plan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I deeply deplored some of the things that the Minister said on planning last week. I do not wish to raise disagreements that we had at our last meeting. However, things were said by the Minister—and, being a Minister, he is widely reported—about people objecting against all planning and attempting to prevent all planning, about lawyers making a killing out of this and a beanfeast out of that. I do not think that such observations are helpful, because they are not
	<span class='label label-info column'>164</span>
justified. In the proposals we are putting forward for changes in planning proedure we have to recognise that people have a legitimate right to object to proposals which affect their property. It is one of the liberties left to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I ask the Minister to confirm that not only will there be an inquiry into the structure plan, as such, if objections are lodged and maintained, but that there will also be an inquiry into action area local plans where objections to those detailed proposals are put forward and maintained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer to those questions, of course, is that there will be public inquiries, if they are necessary, into both types of plan, but the object of the Bill is to reduce the area of disagreement between the individual and the local authority as far as possible. The successful local authorities will see fewer and fewer objectors at the formal stage and more and more at the preliminary stages and there will, therefore, be fewer inquiries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not share the hon and learned Gentleman's opinion of what I said last time. It is right that individuals wiil defend their property to the bitter end and will employ lawyers to frustrate the general intention, and they are right in doing so, for that is their birthright, but we must not deceive ourselves that this is the individual challenging the almighty State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The community has an interest also. The purpose of the Bill is to convince the individual either that his property is not as badly threatened as he thinks or that the change of use is such that he ought to agree to it. Hundreds and thousands of our constituents in Scotland are giving up their homes. Many of them have bought their single end on a pittance, but, nevertheless, they represent the owner's life savings of £100, £200 or more in one room and a kitchen, in property which is redeveloped for the benefit of the community. Many lose their savings and all they get in return is a council house, admittedly a good one, but they have still lost their savings. Opposition on the ground that they should not lose a single thing is harming not only themselves but the whole community when they say an area should not be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0909">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>165</span>
redeveloped since they want to stay in a room and a kitchen because it was bought with their life savings. I respect the right of the individual, but there comes a time when we have to measure it against the welfare of the community. The Bill is not intended to stop objections, but to persuade people that what is happening is fair. Where the plan does not coincide with the local plan, that objection should be made at the early stage, and the person affected can show that the local authority's intention on local plans might be challenged. There is also the case where there is dialogue between the objectors and the local authorities. I have never known a planning committee in Scotland to be completely insensitive, although there are, I admit, degrees of sensitivity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members must realise that, with the bulk of planning applications and the shortage of professional staff—even though we have made manful attempts to get more—we are facing a difficult staffing situation. We have to delegate more and more decisions further down the line. A lot of the work of the planning conveners should not be done by planning conveners and committees but should be handed over to officials, subject to recall by council members. otherwise life for planning conveners and committees will become impossible under the Bill. Similarly for the Scottish Office. I accept the compliments of the hon. and learned Gentleman to the Department. If anything, they were not fulsome enough. Many officials there are subject from time to time to abuse by M.P.s on issues affecting their constituencies and it is good to get this blanket endorsement that we have such a healthy staff at St. Andrew's House. There should be more of them. We should remind hon. Members opposite of this when we get downstairs and talk about public expenditure and the number of civil servants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are able to handle the increased volume of the structure pians but we shall not be dealing with the local plans, except in exceptional circumstances. The volume of work will be the same but it will be work of a different quality and of a quality more suitable to the talents of the people who everyone here agrees, work well for Scotland. We do not envisage a substantial increase in staff in the Scottish Office. We already have some vacancies in the establish-
	<span class='label label-info column'>166</span>
ment. If we were to get them filled we would be criticised for having so many civil servants, but we would like to get them. They will be dealing with different work, much more commensurate with their capacities.

Hon. Members should not agree 100 per cent. with one position or another. The reporters are mostly lawyers, but not in the category of which I was speaking, and one does not have to be a lawyer to be a reporter. However, we have a strong tradition of non-legal reporters in Scotland and their reports are good. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>168</span>
hon. Member should not imply that anyone put forward who was not a lawyer was somehow a second rate man.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister of State has referred to the words he used last time. He said:

	<br><blockquote><p>"These Amendments would be a delight in the profession if ever they were put through."—[OFFICIAL RFPORT, 	<i>First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 17th April, 1969; c. 129.]</p></blockquote>
That seemed, as reported, to be referring to the whole profession. The hon. Gentleman is now stating that there is frustration in our planning procedures in Scotland in some cases. There is no disagreement about that. We are sitting here trying to put it right, and trying to improve the planning procedures in Scotland, but the Minister was being scathing about a whole profession in saying that it was the legal profession that was at fault. As my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) was modest in defending himself I feel I must say that the Minister, as usual, was making a statement which could have been misunderstood. If he wishes to correct it, he has corrected it today. Of course there are frustrations, but he is wrong to blame the legal profession as those words appear to do. Some of the reporters, who are mostly members of the legal profession, have done a good job in their tasks of making inquiries and reporting. That is one of the reasons we have not had the delays which there have been in England and Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may briefly end this unfortunate discussion I would say that, in all the inquiries in which I have been involved, I know of no instance in which an improper approach has been made by any member of my profession in promoting the legitimate interests of his client. We have to watch that, in our anxiety to get planning going ahead, we do not fall into the trap of assuming that opposition is meant to defeat the purpose of planning. We must always accept, in a democracy, delays in planning, and I am sure the Minister of State accepts that this delay is a price

	<div class='title'>ALTERATION OF STRUCTURE PLANS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed</i>, That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This Clause is particularly important. Although no Amendments have been put down to it we do not want to allow it to pass without discussion. If the structure plans are to perform the function we wish them to perform it is important that once they have been drawn up it should be possible to amend them and bring them up to date in the light of circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to ask how the Minister sees this alteration procedure working. For example, how frequently does he imagine it will be necessary to renew these plans? He said that a structure plan is a broad canvas. Therefore, one would not expect the same kind of review to be necessary as in the case of a local plan. How often does he think it will be necessary to review these plans, and in what detail will it be necessary to carry out a review?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, there is a duty on the local planning authority to keep its plans under review. How often does the Minister of State envisage a new plan altogether coming forward? This may be looking a good way ahead, but how long does he imagine that a plan would remain effective and not require to be made a completely new plan? If he envisages a very long life for a structure plan the procedure during that long life will be all the more important than in a shorter life. I appreciate that the Government have been trying to get away from the rigidity of quinquennial reviews under existing planning procedures, and we want to get flexibility, but it would be helpful if we could know how often the hon. Gentleman thinks a
	<span class='label label-info column'>170</span>
complete review and new plans will be necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, because this is not written into the Clause, I ask what publicity will be available for alterations. We had a long discussion on Clause 3 about publicity. If publicity is important in relation to the main plan, it is equally important in relation to alterations, so that people may know what is happening to the plan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I raise a particular point which was brought out in the report by the Planning Advisory Group. When it discussed amendments to structure plans it pointed out that, in its opinion, because the plan was a broad canvas, the amendments would tend to take place mainly on the written part of the plan. The Group did not envisage great alterations being made in diagrams and maps. Could the Minister say whether he envisages these alterations following the lines suggested by the Group—mainly to the written part, and recognising the difficulties of alterations to the diagrams and maps? When alterations are made the plan should be reprinted and brought up to date in its full amended form. We should not just have amendments noted, so that one would have to refer somewhere else to find what amendment was made. It was a proper recommendation made by the Group that the plans should be reprinted so that an up to date plan could be seen, and not just a bit of an original plan to which amendments had been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important, if we are to keep structure plans up to date and flexible and to take account of changes, that the Minister should enlarge on the points of detail which I have raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is right in suggesting that there is no Section comparable to Section 4(1) of the 1947 Act, which requires quinquennial reviews. When we debated this matter in principle I made some remarks about the fact that there have been delays in one or two places. Some counties have not submitted a development plan and no one has kept exactly to the requirement of the 1947 Act that there should be a development plan with a five-yearly review; the demand is far too great. Therefore, we have virtually replaced Section 4(1) with Clause 1(1) which means that we shall keep the survey material under review, and that the general power to submit

	<span class='label label-info column'>171</span>
proposal for alterations to the structure plan when considered expedient will secure that the structure plan is kept up to date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought the hon. Member's speech was flattering. It was one of the most flattering I have had directed at me for a long time, but flattery gets us nowhere, and, unfortunately, I cannot respond to that flattery. I cannot make prognostications of what is likely to happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman does not always keep them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I tell him that I cannot prognosticate in all circumstances, that does not mean that I shall not try to say a few words about the matter as we see it. The structure plan amendments are bound to be substantial and not to be related just to small parts of the whole area. They would not be made frequently, but infrequently. They would excite a great deal of interest, and, therefore, they would have to be treated as all structure plans are treated in their importance and the way in which they are dealt with in presentation and publicity. I do not regard the alterations referred to in this Clause as insignificant. Time may prove in certain cases that I am wrong. The hon. Member may hold that against me, although in fairness he should not do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I certainly accept the implications of a number of comments made in the Planning Advisory Group's report. How we shall guide local authorities and what regulations we shall make will be as a result of conversations with them after the Skeffington Committee report. A lot of what the hon. Member has asked for will be made clear when we have that report on the way in which the whole matter is to be approached. I regard this Clause as important. These are alterations of substance, which have to be considered carefully, and I commend the Clause to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
After the difficulties of a week or two ago, when we had great problems in trying to persuade the Minister of State of the good value of an Amendment, we hope that he will be in a more conciliatory mood. I want to know why it is necessary to have these words in this Clause. I do not see that they add particularly to the meaning of the Clause and, if they do not add to it, they seem unnecessary. I am sure that this argument will strike a chord in many parts of the Committee, not least in the attitude of the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis). I am sure that we shall have his support, and we look forward to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are looking at the situation which exists after a structure plan has been submitted to the Secretary of State and before the local planning authority has had it either rejected or approved. The purpose of subsection (1) is to enable the local planning authority to go ahead and to prepare a local plan regardless of whether it has had approval of the structure plan from the Secretary of State. I accept that it is right in principle that it should be able to do so, but it is not obligatory on the local authority to go ahead; it is only permissive. Why is it necessary to put in "if they think it desirable"? If the authority does not think it desirable it will not do it. It is as simple as that. If it does not think it desirable it will not go ahead and prepare a local plan pending the Secretary
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0913">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>173</span>
of State's decision on the structure plan. Could the Minister of State explain why these words were put in? If he agrees that they are not necessary we would welcome this as the first occasion on which he has accepted an Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must reject the suggestion that I can be bribed into accepting an Amendment. That is quite wrong. I am trying to accept Amendments when I can do so. I demonstrated that at our first Sitting, and then had the trouble in the second and third Sittings. Not only will I accept Amendments when they are absolutely splendid, but also when they are marginally good.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must explain why this phrase is in the Clause. There is no question about a local planning authority being able to adopt a local plan before there is approval of the structure plan. That clearly would be absurd and illogical. In Clause 9(2) we make that perfectly clear. I am sure the hon. Member is not arguing that the authority should go further than preparing a plan. He is simply concerned about preparing, not adopting. The reason we put in these words is that we think if anyone were to do this it would be with some special reason that the plan had been prepared; in other words, it would be the exception rather than the rule, and normally it would be desirable to get the strategy agreed before going into detail. It can be argued that, in the preparation of the structure plan, by going into detail on the local plan, one would be presuming too much. This preparation might get in the way. So the object of putting in "if they think it desirable" was to make it clear that we regarded the preparation of such a plan as the exceptional situation rather than the situation of
	<span class='label label-info column'>174</span>
rule, because it would get the authority into considerable difficulty if this were done in every case. It might be reaping a great deal of trouble which could be avoided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that we can achieve this by administrative means. Provided the Committee accepts my view about this and the logic of the position I say that it would do no harm at all to make the Amendment, and I accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This really encourages us. The Committee is beginning to look up.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Clause deals with local plans, and, at the outset, we were told, quite rightly, that we have the dual ideas of the structure plan at one level of planning and the local plan at the other level. I can quite see that it would be the exception rather than the rule that a local authority would prepare a local plan in advance of the confirmation of the structure plan, because of the statutory duty and commonsense requirement that the local plan must, broadly, fit in with the structure plan. But subsection (2) provides that the local authority shall
	<br><blockquote><p>"as soon as practicable consider the desirability"</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0914">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>175</span>
of a local plan, and one questions what this is all for. Although the provision of a local plan was permissive under subsection (1), because it was in advance of the confirmation of the structure plan, one assumes that we would then go on to make it mandatory to prepare a local plan after the structure plan had been approved. That is what one would have expected from all that has been said about the general approach to planning. But all that is provided here is that the local planning authority shall consider
	<br><blockquote><p>"as soon as practicable the desirability of preparing"</p></blockquote>
a local plan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is that enough? Does it not follow that there must be a local plan, albeit, of course, after the structure plan has been confirmed? The structure plan is necessarily broad based and in outline, and the only way it can be implemented on the ground is by preparation of a local plan. So we are very curious to know why this departure should have been made. After all, in Section 3 of the parent Act there is a statutory duty to carry out a survey and to prepare a development plan. One knows where one stands there. If this subsection goes through as it stands the only statutory obligation on the local planning authorities will be to prepare a structure plan. All they will have to do after that is to consider the desirability of preparing a local plan. Surely that cannot be right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an Amendment of some substance, and, although it may very well be defective, a point of considerable importance arises here; namely, whether there is to be a local plan following on the structure plan. If not, then we can anticipate trouble at the structure plan stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to spoil the blink of sunshine to which my hon. Friend referred, but subsection (2) is the most incredible subsection that I have seen for a very long time. Here we have this great new Town and Country Planning Bill, which is going to be the blueprint for the way we plan Scotland's future, whether under present local authority areas or under larger areas after reform of local government when we have the laying out of structure plans to cover wide regions and to get right the general
	<span class='label label-info column'>176</span>
principles of planning. But what is the unfortunate local planning authority going to be obliged to do under this legislation? After the structure plan has been agreed by the Secretary of State, and after everything is set fair for the local planning authority to get down to its task of planning the detailed future of the various parts of its area, we then come to subsection (2). One can imagine the officials in the planning committee pouring over the Act, to see what obligations are placed on them by the dynamic actions of Government to guide them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are six different qualifications in this subsection to prevent the authorities taking action quickly, efficiently, smoothly and sharply in the business of drawing up local plans. First of all, it is said, very encouragingly, that they "shall" do it, and the reader might well be excused for thinking, "Here is something that is going to be straightforward, brisk and quick". But then immediately the qualifications begin. What does "as soon as practicable" mean? It can mean anything that anyone likes it to mean.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not this week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It can mean not this week, my hon. Friend says and as the Leader of the House is famed for often saying. It can mean not this month or not this year. It can mean anything at all. There is nothing specific about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then after "as soon as practicable", the subsection says that they have only to consider what they have to do. They do not have to do anything. As if that were not enough, they then have to keep under review—not the doing of it—the "desirability" of preparing a local plan. Only then, if they consider it desirable, and if they have not already done so, are they obliged to provide a plan for any part of the district. We are entitled to expect something a little more definite than that. Surely any local planning committee is going to be in a pretty poor way if it cannot feel that it is required to do more than that about preparing local plans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Amendment cuts out a whole lot of verbiage which is of no advantage to anyone who wants to get the job done, and which is an absolute excuse, for any local authority which does not wish to get on with the business of preparing local plans, to prevaricate for years and years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0915">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>177</span>
There is nothing in this Clause which makes it awkward for anyone who does not wish to get on with the job. So I ask the Minister of State to look at this Amendment very seriously indeed. Does he really envisage that, after a structure plan is approved by the Secretary of State, the local planning authorities are not to be obliged to go ahead and prepare local plans? Is it not his desire that they should be under the obligation to get down to the job as quickly as possible? I am sure that it will be the desire of anyone affected to get down to work as quickly as possible, because there is nothing worse than being threatened under a structure plan but sitting around for weeks or months and not knowing what is going to happen. I am not suggesting that the vast majority of local authorities will use this as an excuse for doing nothing, because they are only too anxious to get ahead. Certainly, the planning officers are always anxious to get ahead, as that is what they are there for, and that is what they like to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To legislate in a way which is so uncertain and which is so pussyfooting about the obligations placed on local planning authorities to prepare local plans is a complete negation of the object of legislation, which is to lay down quite clearly to local authorities and officials what central Government expect them to do. Some of them may not wish to move as fast as the Secretary of State of the day may wish, and this sort of wording is a useless way to draft legislation. So I hope that the Minister will consider very carefully the possibility of cutting out these words, and making it perfectly clear that once a structure plan is agreed a local authority has an obligation to get on with the job of preparing a local plan. There is nothing in the Amendment which would embarrass local authorities in preparing plans for the various parts of their regions, but the present wording is so vague and so obtuse and is covered with so many qualifications that I hope the Minister will think again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is obvious that the draftsmen have done what it has been suggested this Bill might do for the legal profession; they have provided ample opportunity for amateur lawyers on this Committee to consider the legal quibbles about the wording of this Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>178</span>
I agree entirely that, if possible, this wording ought to be simplified and, for the life of me, I cannot see why it is not possible to say that the local planning authority shall prepare as soon as practicable a local plan for the district or any part of the district.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I notice that nobody has mentioned Amendment No. 111, about "any part" of the district. I do not see why a local authority must prepare a plan for the whole district, if it requires to prepare a plan for only part of the district.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore that does not make sense to me. It simply means that a local authority has to do far more than is required. The local authority cannot do it if it is not practicable, so that is obviously a waste of words. I gather that the effect of this will be that the local authority shall prepare a plan. It can only do that as soon as practicable, so a good many of these qualifying words could come out. As we have been reminded, we put in previous Bills a whole lot of "shalls" to which nobody has ever paid any attention. Furthermore, if something is impracticable nobody can do it, and nobody cannot do it before considering it. Also it is an insult to suggest that any local authority would make a plan without considering it, or even without considering the desirability of it, so there seems a great deal of sense in getting rid of as many of these words as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to follow the right hon. Gentleman who has taken the point, and there might well be a good reason for accepting his view about "part" of a local plan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many ways the local plan is not going to be widely different from the present development plan and, speaking as a one-time chairman of a local authority planning committee, I am sure that if this legislation came before that committee it would say, "What is the most important for us?" We accept in the wider concept of development in our areas that we want a structure plan, but for the day-to-day working our bible is our development plan, and our local plan. A reading of this Clause suggests that the local plan follows the structure plan. Most planning authorities will say, "Let's get our main problem clarified in our local plan", particularly in the urban
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0916">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>179</span>
areas, where there are day-to-day problems, applications coming in and decisions to be made. They will say, "Let's get this right, and when we have time we will get down to the wider operation of the structure plan". It is not unnatural that the average member of a local authority should look at the immediate problems first.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have put the cart before the horse here. We should be legislating for the local plan first and insisting on it, not with this woolly definition set out in subsection (2) but with a definite authorisation that the authority must produce a local plan. I accept that in the near future this may be a moving on from the present development plan. If we are to have this Measure we had better get down to it and produce the local plan soon. As the right hon. Member for East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn) said, a large area in present development plans will be unchanged. There is no need, in the great rural areas of perhaps tens of thousands of acres, to have any great depth to the local plan. What we do need is a detailed and early look at our urban areas, and this should be part of a local plan and should be done as soon as practicable, certainly before the structure plan. First things come first.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a great deal in what the hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) says. His description in the earlier part of his speech about the problems facing local planning committees was very real. I did not follow his logic towards the end of his speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) had embarrassed himself, by knowing what was the experience of the hon. Member for Dumfries, or, for that matter had read the P.A.G. Report, or re-read it, he would not have been able to make such a blistering attack. I think that he will look bock on the speech with a certain amount of regret. He clearly has been taken in by the diagrams, and has not read the text in the Report. There are nice diagrams, but one must read the text.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman looks closer at the Clause he will see that the intention is that a local planning authority shall "as soon as practicable" prepare local plans for action areas, if they have not
	<span class='label label-info column'>180</span>
already done so. The hon. Member for Dumfries was very good in pointing out the difficulties of a member of a local planning committee, and the need for choosing the correct priorities. In terms of the individual concerned solely with his own property, he is very anxious to know what will happen in the action areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (6) is very important to do with priorities. When the hon. Member for Ayr goes on about authorities—not all of them, of course; he was very circumspect—being dilatory, he forgets that under subsection (7) the local authority "shall … as soon as practicable prepare" any other local plan the Secretary of State directs. In other words, if it is in default in the Secretary of State's judgment, we have the power of direction. Subsection (2) states
	<br><blockquote><p>"… the local authority shall as soon as practicable consider"</p></blockquote>
the need for the preparation of any local plan and prepare this if it is considered desirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dumfries, and I am sorry to embarrass him, pointed out that certain areas in the structure plan may not be subject to change. We have never had any arguments about the second Amendment. This is the essential point. There may be parts of the area in the structure plan that have not changed at all. There may be other parts which have quite minor changes, and others not of remarkable substance. A local authority has to decide the question of priorities and consider which will be taken in which order within the structure plan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not suggesting that this is a perfect Clause but it tries to help local authorities who are preparing a structure plan, with an overburdened staff, and it recognises that, by present-day planning procedures, it places fresh burdens upon that staff. The hon. Member for Ayr is talking about the tremendous burden which falls upon many elected members, and unpaid members of local authorities, in terms of planning. We have to pay some regard to the fact that we are switching them to a new system, and that it will take some years for them to re-do the work in cases where it would serve less purpose than in, say, the action areas or other areas. What we are attempting to express in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0917">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>181</span>
the Clause is this need not to do everything at once—because that is what the Amendment means. The Amendment means that local plans covering the entire structure area must be embarked upon and presented. That is not fair to the authorities——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nevertheless, a local authority must then, having this absolute obligation upon it, either nullify the meaning of the Act or it must choose priorities such as we are suggesting. The 1947 Act imposed on authorities the need to prepare development plans and to have a quinquennial review. No one observes that, and his Amendment will suffer the same fate, if it is carried. We should be real in statute, and accept the fact that authorities have to deal with priorities. The hon. Member for Dumfries was reflecting very faithfully the kind of reaction that any member of a planning authority would have when reading this Statute, with or without the Amendment. He would realise that the Amendment was impractical, if he recognised it at all. He would say, as the hon. Member did, "Let us take our priorities."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have spelled them out in what we believe to be the right order. One which will cause people more concern is the action areas, the areas of change elsewhere—and they are defined by P.A.G.—and the other areas that, in their sequence, will have to be dealt with. It would be wrong of us to make an absolute obligation to prepare a local plan for the whole of the district as soon as practicable. By virtue of Schedule 9(2) and (3), the 1947 Act development plan becomes the development plan for the area, till replaced, unless it actually conflicts with the structure plan.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dempsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the mover of the Amendment based his argument on the alleged dilatoriness of local authorities, can my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Without notice, I could not say. I can say that, on behalf of the present Secretary of State, I have had to speak many times to several local

authorities and urge them to get on with their work, because it was holding back the development of their counties. They were not getting ahead with essential planning work. I believe that it is possible to get more out of a man by persuasion than by compulsion, and I have never advised, or I cannot recollect having advised, the Secretary of State that he should issue a direction. Off the cuff, I cannot say whether the present Secretary of State, or any other, has issued a direction under the 1947 Act. There is a distinction here, because in the case of the local plan, where so much is being left to the local authority, the Secretary of State is bound to be asked to intervene much more than he has been in the past on the question of local plans. This is because they do not come to him. There may be occasions when people come to him saying that an authority is not doing its work and that it ought to be directed to do so. Even in the past there has not been any exercise of this power. It does not follow that this is exactly on a par with present legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would say to my right hon. Friend the Member for East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn), who has immense knowledge of the preparation of legislation, that I will willingly look at these words to see if they can be deleted. I hope that I have shown that I am prepared to delete as much in the Bill as I can. Good as it is, I am perfectly willing to tighten up its phraseology.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I am perfectly willing to look at the words I do not want to rob the subsection of its meaning. We cannot do everything at once. I must emphasise the priorities, and they are spelled out in subsections (2), (6) and (7) and by reference to Schedule 9(2) and (3).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to lessen the strength of this, but I have heard hours, almost days, of argument as to whether a thing should be "may" or "shall". Curiously enough, in this Clause we have the much sought after "shall", which seems quite meaningless in this context. We cannot have a command that is open to all these "ifs"
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0918">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>183</span>
and "ands"—"if I like", and do not like", "and that is desirable". The word "may" in this case covers ail these "ifs". If anything is necessary then it should not be "shall". That word does not command anyone to do anything, because there are all sorts of get-outs. This seems to be the wrong place to put in "shall". The wording could be telescoped considerably.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My first reaction was to favour the Amendment, and after hearing the arguments I am still in favour of it. In spite of what the Minister has said, on re-reading this subsection, I find it leaves a very muddled impression as to precisely what is intended. The Minister said that he did not want to rob the subsection of its meaning. To me, the intention and the meaning of the subsection is not entirely clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The specific question is: Is it the intention of the subsection that eventually, even if it is only after all sorts of qualifications and considerations, local plans should be prepared, covering the whole of the local planning authority area, and only those areas which are in the area and areas where action is eventually required to be taken in a structure plan? Is it the intention that eventually the local plan should cover the whole of the area?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We must try to do better than this. I have listened carefully to the Minister's objections to the Amendment, and I believe that his arguments are entirely ill-founded. There is nothing in the Clause—as it would remain if the Amendments were carried—which would prevent the local planning authority from doing its job in carrying out work on such priorities as it thinks fit. There is nothing in the words that would remain which would dictate to a local authority that it should abandon anything to do with action areas to get on with local plans. Nothing in the words that would remain would in any way inhibit a local authority from getting down to the job of filling in the details, once the structure plan is approved, in its own time and in its own way, provided it keeps at it and provided it is working at the task which the Bill gives it. Nothing in the words remaining justifies the Minister in saying
	<span class='label label-info column'>184</span>
that by removing these words we are inhibiting the local authority and forcing it to do something it might not be able to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second part of the Minister's argument which I thought ill-founded was that in which he was trying—in the past he has often accused me of this, but I now have the pleasure of accusing him—to ride both horses at once in different directions—I forget exactly how he usually puts it. We cannot, on the one hand, in subsections (6) and (7), spell out the priorities of action which a local planning authority must go through when working out the details of its planning and at the same time say that the words we are proposing to leave out in subsection (2) are essential to spell out the priorities under which the local planning authority must work. Either subsections (6) and (7) do that or the words in subsection (2) do it. It is unnecessary that both should do it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I endeavoured to say at the end was that the whole argument must hang together. It is not a question of taking subsection (2) and then subsections (6) and (7), but taking together subsections (2), (6) and (7) and the references in paragraphs 2 and 3 of Schedule 9. The whole thing has to be read together. It is not fair to isolate one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did not the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) hear the Minister say that he would have a look at all this wording? I think that it needs a draftsman to look at it. It is obviously impossible for this Committee to interfere with the jigsaw puzzle of drafting and consider that the Amendments must be right. The Minister has given a promise to look at it and to have it looked at by skilled draftsmen. I think that is as much as we can ask.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the right hon. Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn). I was coming to that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, before doing so, I wanted to make the point that I do not accept the Minister's contention that the alteration proposed in the Amendments would in any way make it awkward for a local planning authority to get down to the job of filling in the details of its plans. The
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0919">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>185</span>
wording, as it would remain, makes clear what the local planning authority is expected to do. It does not prevent it from doing it in a sensible, practical, normal way. depending on the availability of staff, time and all the rest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. and learned Friend must decide what he wants to do about his Amendment. I am not saying that the wording as proposed by the Amendment is perfect, but I think that the Minister would meet the wishes of the Committee if he undertook to take a good look at this before we come to further stages of the Bill. I hope that he will not reject the Amendment entirely, because I believe that these words add nothing to the meaning. They make it obscure and in no way help the passing of the Bill or the understanding of it by local authorities who have to interpret it. I hope the Minister will be sympathetic to the intention behind the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Briefly, and with a great deal of trepidation, because I tend to agree with what has been said about the subsection, I suggest that if the Clause read,
	<br><blockquote><p>"… shall, as soon as practicable and desirable, prepare a local plan or plans for the district"</p></blockquote>
that would cover everything that my hon. Friend has said and leave open the options which, he said, were so necessary for the local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Committee will not confuse two matters: First, the criticism of the drafting of this subsection, and, secondly, the major point, whether a discretion is to be left to the local planning authority to prepare a local plan. That was the point made by the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. James Davidson).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with what has been said about the wording of subsection (2). My concern is not just that wording, but whether we should leave a discretion here. The Minister said that it is a question of priorities. If it is, I think it would have been better to have started off with the things that a local planning authority must do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear from subsection (6) that a local planning authority must, as soon as practicable, prepare a local plan for an action area. We know where we stand there. We are told in
	<span class='label label-info column'>186</span>
Schedule 9(2) that, as an interim provision, any existing development plan will be treated as a local plan for the purposes of the Act. Paragraph 3 of Schedule 9 tells us that, if there is a conflict between the structure plan and the local plan as defined in paragraph 2, the structure plan will take precedence. There is clearly an intention to have a local plan. That intention is emphasised by the proposition that the local authority does not even have to wait till the structure plan is approved before considering preparing a local plan. It may do it under subsection (1) before the structure plan is approved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main issue is whether the local authority should be under a statutory duty at some stage to prepare a local plan. Once the Schedule 9 provisions have been superseded by events there is no obligation on a local planning authority to prepare a local plan other than the local plan for the action area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to reconsider this matter. Surely, accepting all the transitional difficulties, staff shortages and all the rest, at some stage it will be necessary to underwrite the structure plan with the local plan. Bearing in mind that the time will come when we shall have two levels of responsibility—the structure plan will be the responsibility, presumably, of a regional planning authority, and the local plan will be the responsibility of a local planning authority—it is inconceivable that we should leave this legislation on the basis that, action areas apart, it is for the local authority to consider whether it is desirable that it should prepare a local plan or not. That is the real point of the Amendment. Unless the Minister is prepared to give an undertaking that he will consider that point, as distinct from the drafting point, I should be inclined to advise my hon. Friends to press the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is absolutely nothing wrong with the drafting of these two Amendments. They are perfect. I make that clear right away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have admitted that perhaps we could look at the precise wording of subsection (2). I do not say that it is absolutely perfect. I have already indicated that I am willing to discuss this with my right hon. Friend to see whether we have an excess of words. I do not resile from the position I have tried to explain, that there
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0920">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>187</span>
has to be a sense of priorities for any planning committee, and in that respect subsection (6) is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Taking the hon. and learned Gentleman's last point about the transitional period, where an authority will have to carry out both structure and local plans, I direct his attention back to Clause 2(7). The hon. and learned Gentleman asked what kind of authorities would prepare structure plans. Obviously the larger ones in the initial stages. But perhaps I have not made it clear that, reading Clause 2(7), a large authority like Glasgow would or could be preparing structure plans, because of the large size and extensive coverage that it has to go over. I will not say this is true of Edinburgh, but Glasgow is a good example. If we were not to accept the flexibility in Clause 6, as is now the case, it could be read that whenever Glasgow published Structure Plan A dealing with one section of the city it must go on to do the local plan of Structure Plan A when it preferred, as some of the representations from Glasgow have indicated, to go on to some other activity—perhaps Structure Plan B.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will not go into the long arguments we have had over the meaning of outline C.D.A.s and the legitimate anxieties of the Glasgow Corporation that this planning change might cause a slowdown in the planning for the redevelopment of the city. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Bridgeton (Mr. James Bennett) and my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Hugh D. Brown) have publicly—and my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Kelvingrove (Dr. Miller) has privately—expressed anxiety about planning in the city and its priorities. Those of us who know about the procession of redevelopments coming forward know that if any place in Scotland has to have a sense of priorities and cannot do everything at once, it is Glasgow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be wrong for us to make it an absolute obligation on the local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come back to my right hon. Friend's point about Amendment No. 1ll which seeks to delete "for any part", and I will come to the point raised by the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. James Davidson) on this score. While I
	<span class='label label-info column'>188</span>
am willing to look at the wording to strengthen the meaning that I am trying to give to the subsection, I think that the Amendment would do damage if it were made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely that is covered by the words "as soon as practicable"? There is nothing to prevent a local authority from deciding that it is not practicable to continue with the local plan until it has completed all the structure plans. This is just verbiage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept that. The hon. Gentleman just dismisses some of my points without consideration, which is unlike him normally. Obviously he is in a different mood this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have said that in some cases—here I come to the point raised by the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West—nothing will need to be done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Then they do not do it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One would pick out paragraphs 2 and 3 of Schedule 9. Those of us who know the divisiveness of county council areas know how important it is for each member to feel that his part of the county is being properly considered. It could be argued that the local plans deserve to be considered afresh within the new structure plan. So we would be providing in statute arguments for local members to say that the phrasing of the Clause means there are no priorities; we are all equal. When everybody is somebody, nobody is anybody. It must be remembered that when members of a planning committee read the planning Acts they believe them and believe that they should be translated into action as far as practicable. In the opinion of a planning committee a change may be considered a minor change. If I were a local member for the area affected, it could be argued that I must wait till my turn comes. But I might say, "I do not regard it as a minor change for my constituents; they are just as important; and I insist that my plan is prepared before anything else is done".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) raised the point about action areas. Surely their very name indicates that they have top priority for action. The point that I am trying to argue, though perhaps not very successfully, is that there is need for a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0921">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>189</span>
sense of priority within the Clause as it is. My right hon. Friend's suggestion, to which I listened with great interest, does not help us on this point. I realise that he is trying to be helpful, but in this matter it does not help us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not shutting my mind. I am the only one who this morning has maintained a position of imperfection. Everybody else has the perfect solution, so far as I can see. I am prepared to look again at the possibility of there being an excess of words, particularly in subsection (2), but I am not prepared to depart from the meaning. It is possible that there will never be a local plan for a particular area because there is no development in it, and in that case it would be absurd to make an obligation that local plans should be prepared for all parts of a structure plan area. I am not willing just to say that the second Amendment is bad. The hon. Gentlemen should realise that they are damaging the point of argument they are trying to achieve and I ask them not to press the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are trying to be helpful. This is not quibbling. Do not let us forget that the structure plan is essentially a written statement. The only time one has a plan in the proper sense is in the local plan, because that is a map as subsection (3) says. The position is that a local authority has an obligation to prepare a structure plan but has no obligation to prepare a map, and, apart from the action areas, we are left in an unsatisfactory position. I accept that the action areas must have priority. Indeed, I have suggested that an action area should take the form of a local plan concurrently with the presentation of the structure plan. We know that that may not be possible, but what is the difficulty with the rest of the structure plan area? If there is no development in a certain part of an area there is no plan for it. The local plan shows that part of a local authority area which is to be subject to change of use. I cannot get away from the proposition that if we are to have a structure plan in the form of a written statement, there has to be a map to translate the broad proposal into the detailed proposals on the ground.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the Minister of State is not prepared to budge from that posi-

But we are told, on the one hand, that the Secretary of State has too much to do and that his Department is overloaded, and, on the other, that it should be given the task of saying to the local authority that it should prepare a local plan for an area. The Secretary of State should not take that duty at all. The duty should be on the local authority to provide the plan as soon as possible. I accept that the present situation is not satisfactory. The local planning authority must have a duty to provide a map showing the structure proposals on the ground.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the structure plan promotes no change, presumably not. If we have a structure plan which affects part—and obviously it will be only part—of a local authority area, then the local plan with which we are concerned in this Clause will deal with the part of the local authority area affected by the structure plan, like the amendment or alteration of existing development plans. I do not see the difficulty. Either plans will be relevant and necessary, or not.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to refer to the debate on Clause 2 on 15th April, when we discussed recreational facilities in the preparation of structure plans. We did not press the point because I and my hon. Friends felt that the better point at which to consider this would be in relation to the local plans and considerations, rather than on the wider issue of the structure plan. At that time one was encouraged by the sympathetic hearing given by the Minister of State to the points raised. He admitted that it was probably more appropriate to return to the point later. I was rather worried about his choice of phrase:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Perhaps we can argue that later."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>First Scottish Standing Committee</i>, 15th April, 1969; c. 71.]</p></blockquote>
His remarks up to that point had been helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Planning is important, not only in physical terms of houses and streets but equally for social reasons. We can get new houses and modern flats with the best facilities but merely by building a new house one does not create a new home. New development does not automatically create a new community. The point of the Amendment is to look beyond the mere provision of physical facilities to other things which help to build up a com-</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>munity and to provide the social facilities in one way or another.</p>
	<p>Looking back on the history of some of the older housing areas in Scotland in relation to crime and juvenile delinquency we see we are to some extent reaping the harvest of bad planning in previous years and generations. I confess that, looking back over even our generation, we have not sufficiently learned the lessons from previous generations, and we are still creating concrete and asphalt jungles in which juvenile delinquency and crime tend to flourish. I want to get away from considering planning merely as something physical and to consider social background and building up a sense of community.</p>
	<p>Already local authorities are to have an obligation to take into account the importance of physical environment and the management of traffic. I welcome the latter. We have to do that because the traffic is there, and I would like to write something into the Bill to improve the environment in which people have to live. In this we would be more creative than in merely considering such factors as traffic.</p>
	<p>I return to what I said in an earlier debate. This point has already been raised with the Minister of State by the Scottish branch of the National Playing Fields Association. I must declare a certain interest in it as I serve as a member of the Association's council, and I

have a strong personal interest in putting forward its point of view. The National Playing Fields Association was trying to get statutory and mandatory directives written into the Bill that local authorities should provide the facilities up to a certain standard rather than that that should be left permissive. The Association had a meeting on 31st January with the Minister for Sport and with the Under-Secre-
