<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
<p><i>Resolved,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That during the proceedings on the Education (Scotland) Bill the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock.â€”[<i>Mr. Millan.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the first Amendment I would remind the Committee that there is a Financial Resolution in connection with this Bill. Copies are available in this Room. I should also like to call attention to the fact that adequate notice should be given of Amendments, and that as a general rule I do not intend to call manuscript Amendments.</span></p>

Clause 1</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
FUNCTIONS OF EDUCATION AUTHORITIES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Clark Hutchison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. May I draw your attention, Mr. Jennings, to the first page of this Bill, and the numbering thereon? I submit that you will not understand it, that few of us on this side understand it, and I doubt whether any hon. Members opposite do. It is not a Bill; it is a dog's breakfast. I am tired of being asked to pass legislation which is entirely unintelligible. It is an insult, both to this Committee and to the public outside. The point I wish to put to you is, can you direct that the Committee be postponed till the first Clause is rewritten, or alternatively, that we move to Clause 2 and come back to Clause 1 when the Government have become more sensible and have redrafted this Clause properly?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order. Is it not the function of this Committee to remove all defects such as the hon. Gentleman has pointed out? Is that not what we are assembled for? Can we expect many Amendments
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
from the hon. Member in view of what he has said?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Anthony Stodart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order. I have quite a measure of sympathy with my hon. Friend on this point. When the Bill was first reported on in the public Press I noticed that the description of what was in Clause 1 included this controversial feature about the fee-paying schools. I studied Clause 1 for quite a time but as far as I could see there was nothing about that. Then I discovered that it is in what is subsection 3A although I accept that the Sections in heavy black typeâ€”1, 2, 3 and 3A are all part of Clause 1. This really does not make things easy for Members of the Committee, at least not as easy as they might be. I wish that those who present Bills to us would do so in a way most easy for us to understand. My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison), my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, East (Sir J. Gilmour) and myself are the three wise men from the east and if we do not understand it what hope is there for the Under-Secretary and various hon. Gentlemen and hon. Ladies who come from the west?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alex Eadie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, is not the difficulty due to the fact that many hon. Members opposite and practically all who have spoken about this were educated in England and not in Scotland?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward M. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a serious point of order, Mr. Jennings, if you cannot concede the very valuable and fruitful points put by my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) can you, at least at the beginning of the deliberations, give us some advice as to what kind of language we should use in Committee? Do we refer to Clause 1(1)(1)? This will be a serious problem. Although there is not much controversy in the Bill it seems that much of the real controversy will be about Clause 1, section 1, subsection (1), and so on. We will not know to what we are referring. We will not know whether we are talking about the 1962 Act or this Bill. It will be quite meaningless. If we cannot put the Bill into a meaningful form which all can understand, we should at least get our terms right so that we know what we are talking about. It is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0454">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
often very difficult to follow the debate in the Scottish Committee, because so many hon. Members have specialist knowledge. It will be even more complicated if we do not know to what part of a Measure they are referring. Can we have some kind of agreement to observe certain terms?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Younger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The difficulty we are in could be largely obviated if the typeface used for Clauses were completely different from that for any new parts being written by this Bill into any Act. Perhaps you could have a word, Mr. Jennings, with the appropriate quarters and suggest that a different type face could be used? Another alternative is to print the Clauses in a different colour. This would clearly differentiate what we are referring to. It would make it very much easier for hon. Members and members of the general public.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian MacArthur</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order. The concern which my hon. Friends have expressed does not so much relate to the difficulty confronting members of the Committee, real as it is, as it does to members of the public, who will experience difficulty when they come to read this Bill, and the Act which no doubt will follow it. It is particularly important, when such important changes, some desirable, some very undesirable, are being made in education, that the Act should be easy to understand. During the Second Reading debate I suggested that it would be helpful to the Committee if the Government would look at some of the Clauses, particularly those relating to handicapped children, and propose drafting Amendments simplifying what are very complicated Clauses.<br><br>
I could comment about Clause 1, that it is very confusing. I was disappointed when, entering the Committee this morning, I found that the request, which I had put, as I thought courteously and reasonably to the Government, had been totally ignored. There are no proposals from them to improve the drafting of the Bill. I recall that on an earlier occasion, when dealing with the Social Work (Scotland) Bill we on this side, for much the same reasons, went to a great deal of trouble, without the skilled advice available from Government Departments to Ministers, to try to make sense out of nonsense. We rewrote quite
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
a number of Clauses, and it was only following our pressure that the Government gave way and agreed that the original version of the Bill was really rather complicated. They then came forward with their own proposals. It would save a great deal of time during the Committee if the Government would give some undertaking that they will propose the drafting Amendments that we are asking for and which, in view of the nodding on the Front Bench when I made my request, I was led to expect.<br><br>
Clause 1 is difficult to follow, particularly for those who are not as familiar as we are with the drafting of Bills and, in these last few years, with the excesses of Governments. The difficulty is that Clause 1 introduces four new Sections. In that part of the Bill there were only three Sections previously. Now we find this rather curious 3A. My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) referred to subsection 3A. I knew what he meant, because there is only one part of the Bill with that designation, but, with great respect, this is not a subsection 3(<i>a</i>) I do not know quite how to describe it, and my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) has shown how difficult it is to describe properly the various parts of this Clause. I suppose that what my hon. Friend described as subsection 3A is simply a part of subsection (1) of Clause 1. How do we describe this? When we come to the first line of the new Section 1 to be put into the 1962 Act how do we describe that? Is it the new Section 1, then subsection (1) of Clause 1, subsection (1) of the 1969 Act? Do we refer to it as Clause 1(1)(1)(1)?<br><br>
There is a further question on the drafting which again points to the need for a consolidation Measure. In Clause 1(3) we find some of the changes made to the 1962 Act by the earlier parts of Clause 1. They are difficult enough to get into their right place in the 1962 Act. In subsection (3) we find ourselves swimming against a flood tide of tautology. It says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Notwithstanding the provisions of section 3 of the principal Act (as set out in subsection (1) above), the power to charge feesâ€¦. conferred â€¦ by the proviso to section 1(3) of that Act (as originally enacted) shall continue to be available to â€¦"</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0455">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will help the Committee with some drafting provisions, because at present it is very difficult for those outside to follow this properly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can you give the Committee guidance, Mr. Jennings? Many of us on this side assumed that the points now being raised would be dealt with when we reach the appropriate Clauses and subsections. I had assumed, I hope correctly, that we would deal with these things then. It that correct?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have been very generous in allowing reasonable discussion of this point of order, which appears to be a vital one. A number of points have been raised. Let me deal with them one by one. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) asked what language was to be used. As a Sassenach in charge of turbulent Scots, I must tell him that the language to be used here must essentially be English. That is laid down for any deliberations in any part of the House. That is the first thing.<br><br>
The second point raised by an hon. Member was that the Bill was drafted in such a way that it would lead to ignorance on the part of Members as to what was meant. Ignorance in a Chairman is a good thing, because then he can bring to bear a completely unbiased opinion; he can be perfectly impartial. Ignorance on the part of hon. Members of the Committee is inexcusable, but the fault of ignorance on the part of hon. Members can be laid at different doors, and so we come to the real nub of the argument, the question of the drafting.<br><br>
10.45 a.m.<br><br>
I have been asked to alter the order of procedure as to the numbering of Clauses, Sections and subsections. That I cannot do. It is laid upon the Chairman of this Committee to carry out what the House itself has ordered. The point made by the hon. Member for Glasgowâ€”â€”</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Govan. The shipyards.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: â€”Govan (Mr. Rankin) is valid, namely, that these points can be raised when we reach the relevant part of the Clause, Section or subsection. I
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
therefore rule that I cannot accede to the request made by the hon. Member who raised the point of order.<br><br>
We come to Amendment 1. With this Amendment we will take Amendment 2, in page 1, line 16, leave out "school".<br><br>
Amendment 11, in line 13, leave out "school education" and insert "primary, secondary", and Amendment 12, in line 16, leave out '"school education" means' and insert 'primary and secondary education comprise', are starred. I am prepared, because of the short time of notice, to allow the hon. Member for Glasgow, Springburn (Mr. Buchanan), who has tabled those two Amendments, to refer to them in the discussion on Amendment 1, but I cannot allow a separate Division on Nos. 11 and 12.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment 1, in page 1, line 13, to leave out "school".<br><br>
It will certainly seem strange to you, Mr. Jennings, in taking the Chair for the proceedings on the Education (Scotland) Bill, that the first word we want to remove is "school". It may be that after we have had a debate and the Minister has replied we shall not press the Amendment to a Division.<br><br>
My opening remarks have been preempted by the many points of order, because I agree with my hon. Friends that there is confusion in the Clause as drafted. This is because Section 1 of the 1962 Act is being rewritten mainly because of the inclusion of this important term "school education". I accept that the Amendment would remove "school". We want to know why the Minister prefers this definition to that given in the 1962 Act of
<br><blockquote><p>"primary, secondary and further education'.</p></blockquote>
The confusion arises to some extent because this old definition of
<br><blockquote><p>"primary, secondary and further education".</p></blockquote>
is being reintroduced later in the Clause for definitive purposes till the appointed day for the introduction of the Bill when enacted.<br><br>
The important question we want to discuss is why there should be this change to "school education". In the past there was always a clear distinctionâ€”I think that everybody understood where it was
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0456">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
â€”between primary, secondary and further education. Now there is an attempt by some authoritiesâ€”one reads about it in the educational Pressâ€”to blur the top of the primary section and the bottom of the secondary section into a form of middle school. The issue raised in the Amendment is the flexible period between the two schools which may in future become a part of Scottish education.<br><br>
The profession knows where the distinction lies between primary and secondary teachers. There is apprehension among some teachers as to what the middle school innovation will mean. Will it mean that primary teachers will be teaching in the middle school and perhaps doing work which should be done by secondary teachers? They have this fear. They fearâ€”I hope that this fear can be allayedâ€”that this is a means whereby a shortage of secondary school teachers in future could be covered up by primary teachers doing in the middle school the work which should be done by secondary teachers. This may well be accentuated when we reach the point of raising the leaving age.<br><br>
There is also concern among teachers as to whether there is not to be a much wider range of subjects in school education for which they will be responsible. The Explanatory and Financial Memorandum indicates that there will be a widening of their activities, because it covers
<br><blockquote><p>"facilities for social, cultural and recreative activities and physical education and training."</p></blockquote>
I hope that the Minister will say whether the duties of teachers will be widened significantly by the change to "school education".<br><br>
I would not like the Minister to think that by moving the Amendment we are necessarily at this stage saying that we should revert to the old definition of
<br><blockquote><p>"primary, secondary and further education".</p></blockquote>
We as Members of Parliament must be flexible in education and realise that in recent years there have been many changes and that there will be more. On Second Reading the Secretary of State indicated that in his view "school education" meant one integrated process. This is the nub of the Amendment. What does the Minister think is the difference
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
between "school education" and the old definition of
<br><blockquote><p>"primary, secondary and further education"?</p></blockquote>
This is a most important debate at the very beginning of our consideration of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir John Gilmour</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) needs explanation from the Under-Secretary. The Explanatory and Financial Memorandum stresses that the new Section 1 introduces into the Statute the term "school education". Most of us thought that education in schools was school education, but perhaps it needs underlining. The Explanatory and Financial Memorandum goes on to say that
<br><blockquote><p>"The new section 1 â€¦ extends the functions of education authorities in relation to the provision of facilities â€¦"</p></blockquote>
What consultation has there been with the General Teaching Council about the extra work which presumably will fall on staffs in schools as a result of importing this new definition into the Bill? We hear much about the troubles of the Council. This opportunity can be taken to ensure that everyone understands exactly what the change will mean.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Younger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When I first saw the proposal to introduce the term "school education" I thought that it was a very good idea in reflecting the changed attitudes to the middle period of education. As the Secretary of State said on Second Reading, the differences are being more and more blurred between these two hitherto separated parts of education. However, on reflection I take the view that to introduce the new term and at the same time to re-define the primary and secondary parts of education makes the change at this time nonsensical. Either we are to have the change or we are not. By bringing in the new term and then re-defining the old terms we are getting the best of neither of the two worlds.<br><br>
Perhaps the Under-Secretary will explain in greater detail what the proposed change will result in. It can be called "school education", but it will be very relevant for teachers whether they are employed in a primary teaching rÃ´le or a secondary teaching rÃ´le. A division at the age of 12 is written into the Statute for the purposes of teachers, their employment, their remuneration and their
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0457">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
grading. How can we consider the question of teaching courses in the framework of the Bill with the clear definition of "primary" and "secondary" and with this division at the age of 12?<br><br>
In the beginning I thought that it was a good idea to introduce the new wording, but I think that it has been gravely weakened by going only halfway instead of the whole way. Before we have had a debate and heard from the Minister I am not prepared to say whether I believe that we should go the whole way or go no way at all but revert to the fully defined differences between "primary" and "secondary". We want a much fuller explanation than the Secretary of State was able to give us on Second Reading and I hope that the Under-Secretary will be able to explain what this half measure in the Bill will achieve.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Richard Buchanan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Jennings, for allowing me to discuss Amendments 11 and 12. I have only myself to blame for the fact that they were tabled so late. I overestimated the Opposition's ability to see the weaknesses in the Clause.<br><br>
I made my apprehensions about the Clause very clear on Second Reading. I do not intend to go over all the arguments. It is obvious to all of us that the Minister is effectively eliminating the distinction between primary and secondary education. Although page 3 contains definitions, these are merely incidental. Primary and secondary education having been washed out, these definitions are put in merely to make some sense out of the principal Act, which deals with primary and secondary education.<br><br>
If "school education" is meant to continue in a single process the last years of primary school and the earlier years of secondary school, we are letting ourselves and the profession down and we shall let down very badly the concept which in the Bill we seem to hold most dear, namely, comprehensive education. I tried to make it clear on Second Reading that I am greatly in favour of practical measures being taken to improve comprehensive education. My children having gone to comprehensive schools I have some appreciation of the difficulties which the staff at such schools have. Many of the theories put up for comprehensive educa-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
tion do not hold water and will not stand up unless the House is prepared to support them.<br><br>
At present the relationship between the Government and the profession is not as solid as one might think. It is a little sensitive. Things will not be helped if we try to impose this without the full agreement of the teaching organisations and students at Jordanhill, Hamilton College, Moray House, Falkirk, or wherever it may be. Have the students who are undergoing training to equip them to engage in primary education been consulted about being drawn into the beginning of a secondary course?<br><br>
The 1944 and 1945 Education Acts were Acts of which we were all proud, in that they gave a statutory basis to the concept of secondary education for all. The developing countries sometimes neglect primary education, because they realise that if their countries are to come through it is the people who will succeed in the secondary phase who will have to bear the brunt of their country's development.<br><br>
If I understand it correctly, we have a proposal here which is meant to bring about dilution at the secondary stage. As I see it, it turns the clock back to the old supplementaries, when, if a boy was not going on to what was then known as the higher grade school, the senior secondary school, he stayed in his primary school and did two years extra, leaving at 14 years of age.<br><br>
11.0 a.m.<br><br>
If that is not in the Minister's mind, nothing would please me more than an immediate refutation of what I have suggested. However, I remain concerned. In these two years, will it be the bright boy who will continue in the primary school? Will it be the bright boy who is put in the charge of college-trained teachers rather than graduates from university? Certainly not. It will be the fellow who probably needs most attention, the one for whom the comprehensive school was built so as to give him a chance of benefiting from the wider spectrum of education. It will be boys and girls of this kind who will be under the jurisdiction of the non-graduate college-trained teacher. To my mind, we shall let ourselves down badly if we think that is the way to proceed in building up
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0458">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
the comprehensive system. We shall weaken the comprehensive school where it ought to be strong, at its base, and we shall weaken our relationship with the teaching profession, destroying the faith which many people thinking of entering the teaching profession from university might feel as an encouragement to come in.<br><br>
I hope that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State will refute what I have said and give us an assurance that it is not his intention to draft in non-graduate teachers for the first two years of secondary school.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Jennings. Might it not save the time of many hon. Members if we heard at an early stage precisely what is in the Minister's mind, especially on the meaning of "education"?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not within my province to dictate to the Minister at what stage he should intervene. It is entirely up to him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but, further to that point of order, Mr. Jennings, it is evident that the Committee on both sides is anxious. My hon. Friend the Member for Springburn (Mr. Buchanan) has expressed a view which has been running through many minds. I say at once that it is not in my mind. Having been closely associated with education, it is my hope that the Minister will now tell us that the conception of education and its application from the Department will meet the needs of the broad base on which education rests. However, it is important that he should clear the matter up in the minds of those who are in doubt about what this part of the Bill will mean when translated into practice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not within my province either to persuade any member of the Committee to speak, or to dissuade him. If the Minister does not wish to intervene at this stage, I cannot force him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Esmond Wright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I press this matter on the Minister for two reasons. The first has already been raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) and by the hon. Member for Springburn (Mr. Buchanan). The hon. Gentleman stressed that the profession
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
sees behind these proposals dilution of its quality. This is the fundamental question which the Minister must face. I shall not repeat the point that the profession is in a stateâ€”not of broken morale: I do not say thatâ€”but in which its morale is certainly in question. It is clear that the trend is towards the over-supply of primary teachers after 1970â€“71. Are we to understand, therefore, that there will be such a supply of primary teachers that they will be released into what in the old days we should have called the secondary school lower forms and in this way dilute not only the profession but the quality of secondary education? This is a fundamental point on which we must have clarification.<br><br>
The second question will sound, in the presence of a good many ex-teachers, not least yourself, Mr. Jenningsâ€”â€”</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcolm MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman in all circumstances resist any use of qualified primary teachers if there were to continue a grave shortage, after the raising of the school-leaving age, in what he may, perhaps, call the lower forms of secondary school? I say "in all circumstances".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman poses a fundamental question when he says "in all circumstances".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, certainly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In response to that, one has to ask, in what type of courses and in what subjects would one use primary teachers. It might well be, under the revised notions of content of educationâ€”which is not relevant at this pointâ€”that there would be particular subjects in which primary teachers could be used, but no one would persuade me that this would be welcome to the profession at this time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am certain that the hon. Gentleman is thinking of factual cases, about which I know. It has been accepted. But what was not accepted was that these teachers who were put into the first and second years in secondary school were not granted Chapter V recognition and, therefore, were not paid the salary for the job they were doing. That is an important point.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0459">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is an important point, but Chapter V is no longer relevant to the question. What we must not do here is suggest to the teaching profession of Scotland that we are in any way envisaging a dilution of the quality of Scottish education, and there is a disturbing trend in some of the interventions which suggest that.<br><br>
My second point is much simpler, to elicit clarification from the Minister of precisely what the word "school" means when used ungrammatically as an adjective, though it is a noun. I realise that hon. Members opposite know a lot about the schools in which Opposition Members were educated, though I am not always sure about the schools in which Members of the Government party were educated, but I am sure that no school of which I know would approve the use of the word "school" as an adjective. I have consulted the dictionary, not the Oxford Dictionary, which would be irrelevant, but Chambers Dictionary. In every definition of the word "school" one finds it replaced by a noun of one sort or anotherâ€”"a place for instruction", "an institution for education, especially primary and secondary", and so on.<br><br>
The old test is a good test. Take the word out and put the other words in its place,
<br><blockquote><p>"adequate and efficient provision of a place for instruction, education".</p></blockquote>
Are we seriously to propose that? Or,
<br><blockquote><p>"adequate and efficient provision of an institution for education, especially primary and secondary, education"?</p></blockquote>
Are we suggesting that? It would take us back nearly to 1962.<br><br>
The point may sound flippant, but it is not. Already, the word "tautology" has been used by my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries, and rightly so. There is a good deal of jargon in this Measure, and it would be wrong to allow it to go out in this ill-digested state.<br><br>
If the Minister, when using the word "school", means something different from just "education", why not use the word "territorial"? He has dropped from the earlier line the word "throughout" which appeared in 1962. It does not read,
<br><blockquote><p>"â€¦ throughout their area adequate and efficient provision of territorial education".</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
Is he trying to disguise the word "comprehensive"? Is there a fearâ€”I hope there isâ€”of what this word stands for, this jargon word of our time which means precisely what anyone wants it to mean?<br><br>
My hon. Friend suggested the term "integrated education". I notice that the hon. Member for Govan (Mr. Rankin) thought that it meant "broad-based". There is nothing in the dictionary about a "broad base". Behind the word "school" are all sorts of connotations which people have in their minds. Dr. Joad, of blessed memoryâ€”or otherwise, according to someâ€”used to say in answer to every general question, "Everything depends on what you mean by â€¦ "I suggest to the Minister that everything depends on what he means by the word "school". As used here, it carries no meaning, except something different from "further", and in my view it clarifies nothing at all.<br><br>
I press the point upon the Minister. What is behind the use of the word, with all its implications? Would it not be wiser to delete it? There is a good instruction at some schools, at least in some subjectsâ€”"When in doubt, delete; and, after you have deleted, define". I press that instruction on the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a further point of order, Mr. Jennings.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It must be a new point of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a further point of order. It is evident that there isâ€”</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. It cannot be further to the point of order because there is no point of order before me. If the hon. Gentleman is raising a point of order, I shall listen.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I make this point of order, Mr. Jennings. The discussion at present is proceeding in a vacuum, and we wish to know whether the Minister intends to clear up certain points, not of argument but of fact.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not my fault if the discussion is in a vacuum. I repeat that, if the Minister does not wish to intervene at this stage, that is entirely a matter for him, not for me.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Jennings.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to the other point of order, is it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, Mr. Jennings. Would you accept a Motion that the Committee adjourn, and that it do so for a specific period? I make that suggestion because it is clear that the Committee is in a difficulty. It is in a difficulty about, broadly, what is implied by the Clause, and it is in doubt about the language employed to describe the intent here. If we were to adjourn for about 15 minutes and have a talk off the record with the Ministerâ€”[HON. MEMBERS: "No."] Why not? Is there anything so revolutionary in that suggestion that it cannot be entertained seriously at this point? Could we not have a talk with the Minister to see whether he will take us into his confidence? Clearly, there is in the mind of a good many hon. Members the thought of dilution as a consequence of what is happening in the teaching profession at the moment. That isâ€”</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a long point of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: All right, Mr. Jennings. In fact, my purposeâ€”</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have got the point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was moving a Motion which I introduced on a point of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have not accepted such a Motion. Therefore, the hon. Member cannot move a Motion. He rose to a point of order to ask if I would accept a Motion. I allowed him to proceed on that basis.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to be too long in presenting the suggestion for a Motion. I propose, therefore, that, in order to help the Committee, we should now adjourn to see whether talks off the record might eventuate in 15 minutes of thoughtful discussion.</span></p>
<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order. May I ask you, Mr. Jennings, to resist the hon. Gentleman's request. If there were any danger of this Committee going into secret session about something which is vital to Scottish education, it would be gravely mis-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
interpreted. The people of Scotland and the teachers would take the view that we had something to hide. It would be disastrous if we were to go into secret session and gave the impression that we had something to hide. I beg you, Mr. Jennings, to reject this request. If it were followed, it could cause a great deal of damage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: An evil mind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. There is no question of having a secret session.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I never said that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There could not possibly be. The question of private talks is another matter, which is also entirely outside my purview. I regret that I cannot accept a Motion for Adjournment. I repeat that the Minister will intervene when he wishes to do so, and, if he catches my eye, the Committee will then have the very great privilege of listening to him explaining the points at issue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcolm MacPherson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At a time when educational practice and ideas are changing so much it is not surprising if Ministers and others seek to change some of the terminology used. I can sympathise with the desire to use a phrase like "school education", instead of the old division between primary and secondary education, which suggests a greater rigidity than some people would probably wish to see between these two sections of education.<br><br>
I am, however, in sympathy with the view expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Springburn (Mr. Buchanan) on Second Reading and today. The question which arises is whether secondary school places will be filled by primary school trained teachers. This is a matter of major policy which I do not wish to discuss now. There will, no doubt, be other opportunities of discussing it. But there is one subsidiary aspect which is very important. Hon. Members should know in some detail whether changes of this sort or in this direction are taking place. Already in the Departmental Reports there is less specification about kinds of teachers, about teachers with particular types of training, and so on.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0461">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
When I see the phrase "school education" used I begin to wonder whether we shall be able to follow what is happening in the staffing of departments like science and mathematics. These two subjects have been in difficulties recently, but they are not the only ones. We must be clear about how many scientists we are getting in the science departments, how many English specialists we are getting in English departments, and so on. This is essential for following what is happening in education. I am afraid that the use of the phrase "school education" may be an additional step by the Government to make the description of teachers even less specific than it used to be and that we shall know less about what is happening in the secondary schools.<br><br>
I tried to follow the dictionary discussions of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Wright), but I did not get beyond thinking of things like school buses, school dinners, school this, that and the next thing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: And schoolma'ams.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacPherson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Some uses of the word "school" have an adjectival flavour about them. I am not impressed by reference to the Oxford English Dictionary, or any other dictionary, because dictionaries are always records of what has taken place and do not always include records of what is taking place now. In modern times there have been attempts to produce dictionaries of current usage as distinct from standard usage. I suggest to the hon. Member for Pollok that the word "school" is used very widely, and with general acceptance, as an adjective, and it is possible so to use it here.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I replyâ€”</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is this an intervention?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I should like to refer to the point made by the hon. Member for Stirling and Ealkirk Burghs (Mr. Malcolm MacPherson). The dictionary from which I quoted was not the Oxford Dictionary. I emphasised that it was Chambers Dictionary, which, presumably, has close connotations concerning Scotland. However, the other point, which is much more important, is that we are drafting an Act and we cannot allow current usage of "school buses" and "school meals", which are not correct
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
English, although they are in general circulation, to become an excuse or justification for imprecision in an Education Act. It is this imprecision which I question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Margaret Herbison</span> <i>rose</i>â€”</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is this an intervention?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Herbison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is indeed. I am amazed at the attempt of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Wright) to say that "school" can never be used as an adjective.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not correctly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Herbison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely he knows that the decision of what part of speech a word is depends on its use. Almost any noun can be used as an adjective, depending on the part it plays in a sentence. I should have thought that the hon. Gentleman would have realised that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Just to round off this grammatical discourse, may I say that I look upon the word as a noun used adjectivally.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stodart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the lawyers say, I do not wish to dwell on this point, but may I say with great respect to those who have demanded the intervention of the Ministerâ€”</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not demanded: requested.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stodart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: â€”or requested the intervention of the Minister that it is probably of more practical use if all the points are made to the Minister first rather than that he should speak at an early stage and then other people have to put points which he has not mentioned.<br><br>
I wish to raise a perfectly practical point. As I understand it, the Government propose the insertion of the words "school education" because at the moment, under the Statute of education, education has to be either primary or secondary. This would allow for the introduction of what one might call a third tier in education in the middle stage. The Government propose in Clause 1 to do away with references to primary and secondary education. However, Clause 7 proposes that
<br><blockquote><p>"for the words 'between the parent and the authority)' there shall be substituted the words 'arising between the parent and the

authority at the time of the transfer of the child from primary education to secondary education)' "</p></blockquote>
This seems to me inconsistent. If it is argued in Clause 1 that we should get rid of this specific definition, why introduce it in a later Clause? Perhaps the Minister would deal with that point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to deal with three important questions to which I hope the Minister will be able to reply. The first is an amplification of the point made in such a penetrating way by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Wright) about the word "school". Apart from the grammatical problem which has been raised, here we have a word which can mean anything which the Government wish it to mean.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Like Humpty Dumpty.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Apart from whether "school" is an adjective, I share my hon. Friend's view that we do not want to use current sloppy slang as a basis for legal definition. On the other hand, it is wrong to insert a word which can mean anything, because this introduces dangerous implications.<br><br>
The first thing which the Minister must tell usâ€”and this point was ably put by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Spring-burn (Mr. Buchanan)â€”is what "school education" means. In particular, does it mean that local authorities will be under no obligation to provide separate primary and secondary education? If so, the consequences will be considerable. My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) made the valid point that if a middle tier is introduced we are destroying the minor right of appeal by parents on transferâ€”in Clauseâ€”which is a dilution of previous rights of appeal available to parents. Some might have this right and others might not. This would be very dangerous.<br><br>
As the hon. Member for Springburn rightly said, there is a great desire by some educationists to experiment. The hon. Gentleman will recall that on one occasion he and I fought on the same side when it was proposed to set up four-year and six-year secondary schools. This experiment was accepted by some as very sensible, but the result was that certain schools were deprived of the status and opportunities which came from having
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
a five-year and six-year top and there was no form of equality of opportunity in general education within the comprehensive system.<br><br>
My fear is that, if in some areas there were specific, clear-cut primary and secondary education, there would be others with an entirely different system. This could involve very considerable dangers in the education of children when moving from one local authority area to another. How will they fit in if there are a wide range and different forms of education, comparing one local authority area with another? There are minor differences of emphasis on the kind of courses, and so on. This would be entirely different from having a three-tier, four-tier or five-tier system, as presumably would be possible under the Government's definition, or a straight two-tier or even, as might be the case in some areas, one-tire system. This would be very strange.<br><br>
The Minister may say that these are ridiculous ideas and that they will never come about. But provision is being made for this. The Minister must give us the reasons which prompted the change from the primary and secondary school definition. On page 3 of the Bill there are definitions for primary and secondary education, not only in respect of this Bill, but in respect of future enactments. Therefore, there will be references to primary education and secondary education in future legislation and there might be local authority areas in which these terms might have no meaning or relevance. This could be very dangerous, and the consequences for the teaching profession would be considerable.<br><br>
The Government are inserting a definition of "school" at the same time as they are deleting the word "throughout". Instead of having general education provided throughout areas, it is possible that there will be a much greater concentration of education over wide geographical areas, which could be very bad. It would be preposterous if we were to go ahead with a definition like this, which can mean anything. If we do, it will make nonsense of our attempts to draft sensible law to guide local authorities. This definition can mean whatever the Government want it to mean and whatever local authorities, subject to the Government, might want it
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0463">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
to mean. It could mean a very considerable expansion of experimentation, which can cause damage. If the Minister wishes to get rid of the old definition, let him introduce a definition the meaning of which we can understand and which imposes some limitation so that hon. Members, if no one else, may have some idea of the lines along which the Government are working and the scope of the policies which they wish to follow.</span></p>
<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Bruce Millan)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that I have ever known such enthusiasm for getting a Minister to make a speech. The normal complaint is that Ministers intervene before hon. Members have made all their very important and fundamental points. If I had to intervene every time that an hon. Member was under a misconception, I should this morning have had to intervene immediately after the hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro), and I am sure that that would not have been agreeable to the Committee.<br><br>
This morning's debate demonstrates the dangers of trying to bring our statutory terminology up to date with the present situation in education. I am surprised at some of the points which were made this morning, because the reason for the change was explained clearly by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State in Second Reading, and I shall return in a few moments to one point that he made.<br><br>
The change from "primary" and "secondary" in the old Act to "school education" is simply to make the legislation match the fact that in Scotland, as comprehensive education develops, there is no dramatic or fundamental change at the move from primary to secondary education in the sense that one process stops immediately and a different process starts immediately after the school holidays when a child is 12. That is not true in terms of the selective process at the age of 12 as it was, nor is it true in terms of the subjects taught at primary schools compared with those taught at secondary schools.<br><br>
The 1962 Act went further than simply using the terms "primary education" and "secondary education". It defined them in terms of the subjects which were
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
to be included in these concepts of education, and they were to be prescribed by the Secretary of State in regulations. That was Section 2 of the Act. That does not meet the facts today, and subjects are not in practice prescribed in regulations. It would be absurd for a Secretary of State to lay down in regulations the subjects which should be taught in primary schools as distinct from secondary schools. If that had been attempted five or six years ago, French would not have been included in primary schools, and mathematics, in the secondary sense, would not have been included; yet French and mathematics are taught in many primary schools in Scotland.<br><br>
I should have thought that the Committee would welcome a definition which did not mean that the Secretary of State should lay down what subjects should be included in the concepts of primary and secondary education. That is unrealistic and does not meet the facts as they are at present. That is the basic reason for the change.<br><br>
In making this kind of change, it is difficult to eliminate altogether the terms "primary education" and "secondary education". They still have significance from some points of view, in particular from the point of view of the training, qualifications and status of teachers. That was why the Secretary of State made the specific point on Second Reading that the distinction between primary and secondary education was still important for some purposes; for example, the qualifications and salaries of teachers. For that reason, it is preserved, newly defined, in the Bill in Clause 1(2) on page 3, line 1.<br><br>
That answers the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Springburn (Mr. Buchanan) and others about whether the definition of "school education" in some subtle way will lead to a situation in which teachers qualified for primary schools can be employed in the first years of secondary education. That is not mentioned. The criticism was that it would allow the employment of primary teachers in secondary schools in some underhand way. If he thinks that that conclusion can be arrived at by changing the definition without anyone noticing, my hon. Friend is more naive than I give any hon. Member credit for, in view of the present state of Scottish
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0464">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
education, the vigilance of the teachers' Associations, and the way in which a change of this sort would have to be negotiated and discussed. However, the Bill says nothing about this, and the status of teachers is not affected by the definition of "school education".<br><br>
There will be difficulties about the staffing of any middle schools established in Scotland. But we should not get that out of perspective. Present expectations are that there will not be more than a handful of middle schools in Scotland in the foreseeable future. Only one education authority is definite about middle schools, and only for a small part of its area. That is Stirlingshire. But a middle school will straddle what is considered to be the edge of primary and secondary education at present. Therefore, the definition is more relevant to the middle school concept than the old definition in the Act which we are supplanting by the new one in the Bill.<br><br>
I was not sure whether the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) was suggesting that the Government should say that there should be no middle schools in Scotland because of the problems involved in them. I do not take that attitude, and I represent a Government who very often are accused unjustly of adopting dogmatic attitudes. Two authorities have been interested in this. They are Stirlingshire and Edinburgh. We have said that it is an interesting experiment and that we would like to see it developed if that is what the authorities wish. The initiative must come from them. Obviously there are problems involvedâ€”of staffing, and so onâ€”which will have to be worked out before middle schools begin to operate, but we would not take the attitude that one cannot have even an experiment of this sort anywhere in Scotland simply because there may be difficulties about the status of teachers involved in the operation of these schools.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. Friend will be able to say a little more about the middle school. I am interested in this comparatively new development. What age of pupil does it cater for, and what sort of curriculum does it provide?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These are very interesting points, Mr. Jennings, and no doubt you
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
would be interested to hear them developed. However, they are not relevant to the Amendment. In fact, there are no middle schools in Scotland at the moment. In Stirlingshire, I think that the age will be from 10 to 14. That is considered to embrace the last two years of primary and the first two years of secondary education as they exist at the moment. However, it is not for me to be dogmatic about ages or curricula. Those are matters for the authority involved to decide.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is this the introduction of an English idea into Scottish education?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Well, it might conceivably be thatâ€”[HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."]â€”but I am not sure that middle schools are all that common in England, although one or two authorities have thought about them in terms of comprehensive reorganisation. The point is that the Committee should not take the line that we must not allow it to happen. It is a little off the mark of what we are discussing in the Amendment.<br><br>
On the point about grammar, the word "school" is used widely as an adjective in educational circles. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Wright) may be interested to know that it has statutory precedent. "School age" is also a term which is used in educational legislation, and presumably "school" there is used as an adjective and not as a noun.<br><br>
Two hon. Members drew attention to the point in the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum about extending the functions of education authorities
<br><blockquote><p>"in relation to the provision of facilities for social, cultural and recreative activities and physical education and training."</p></blockquote>
This is largely relevant to the increased powers which we are giving to education authorities to provide these facilities for the population at large, outside the schools, rather than dramatic developments in the schools. It is of no great significance in terms of imposing new obligations on teachers which they do not have under existing legislation. Schools provide now for social, cultural and recreative activities and physical education and training.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0465">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 27</span>
Then there was the point about the dropping of the term "throughout their area" and substituting "for their area" so that the subsection now reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"It shall be the duty of every education authority to secure that there is made for their area adequate and efficient provision of school education and further education."</p></blockquote>
It recognises that many authorities provide some of their education facilities outside their areas for pupils in their areas. Glasgow is a good example. Then again, blind people in many areas have to be provided with facilities outside their areas.<br><br>
I think that that deals with all the points of importance raised on the Amendment. The new definition is an innocuous one in the sense that there is nothing sinister being smuggled in under it. It is a very important one, and it represents the recognition of some of the realities of Scottish education.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that hon. Members are grateful to my hon. Friend, who has calmed and soothed many fears with his rational explanation.<br><br>
Although he did not say so specifically, he indicated that education has always been in a state of continuing flux, with all sorts of terms used during its evolution. Over the years, such expressions as "pre-school", "after school", "elementary", "primary", "supplementary", "advanced", "secondary", and "further education" have been used. Every time that a term has been changed, fears have been expressed as to its connotation.<br><br>
11.45 a.m.<br><br>
I have always found in Scotland that there is a desire in the heart of every parent to see that the education of his child is no less worthy than that of any other. There is this continuing feeling and the introduction of "school education "has brought out a good argument. The footery point as to whether it was an adjective or a noun does not do the hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Wright) the credit he normally brings upon himself. He is a distinguished person in many waysâ€”[<i>Interruption</i>], Of course he is. There is no reason why we should not recognise that, even on this side of the Committee. I will not say that he stands out like a pearl in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
a sea of mud, but he is distinguished, and has lowered his standards a little in making that speech.<br><br>
Education is still in a state of flux, which is why I asked my hon. Friend to say a word about what is the purpose of the middle school. It is something new to us. One wonders how it will fit into ten years of educationâ€”primary school, middle school and secondary school. There will be a lot of cramming if those three periods are to be fitted into a comparatively brief educational life. I wonder whether if at the back of my hon. Friends mind there is not germinating the idea that an extension of the school-leaving age to 16 is now a very necessary step.<br><br>
Everything has been pointing that way. Bringing in a middle school will evidently cater, if it means anything, for a group that will not be accepted as having the aptitude to take a full secondary education. How are we to have a middle school without creating a distinction? That is something which I do not want to see.<br><br>
That is why I like the word "comprehensive" far better. One school, comprehensive, to fit every ability and every aptitude, expressing itself through these children. This is Government policy, accepted, I imagine, by all those listening to me. All children who are physically sound and do not require special education are making a contribution to the development of society. Whether with hands or brain, it is still a contribution society needs for its full development. I would rather diminish the number of differences in the educational structure and bring it to one comprehensive idea: Jack's as good as his master: the boy or girl who studies foreign languages, science and all these wonderful things, is no more important, in a social sense, than the boy who goes into a shipyard in Govan. That boy is doing as big a job for his country, if he applies his mind to it, as any other person.<br><br>
This is recognised within many of our industries, particularly shipbuilding where we are teaching young boys, using men of great scientific and technical eminence. Teaching is carried on in schools at the yards. This is efficient, able teaching, to give these boys the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0466">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 29</span>
scientific and engineering knowledge so essential to the country and to the shipyard.<br><br>
Perhaps we are all correct in the long run, and primary school, middle school and secondary school are all contributing to the idea of the comprehensiveness of education. If that is the interpretation, good and well, I would accept it, but I would like to see it manifested more clearly when we talk about a vital step.<br><br>
I hope that we are all wrong in our assumption of what is happening just now among teachers but the sudden disruption in education at classroom level which might take place, affecting large numbers in their final years of education, could lead to a lowering of standards, a lowering of attainment among those who may have to step in, in a temporary role to deal with the problem. I know from experience that changes accepted on a temporary basis in education in Scotland have, time and again, become permanent. These are the dangers, and I am certain that my hon. Friend has them in mind, and that everything will be done, even at the eleventh hour, to obtain an agreeable solution to the problems which disturb some parts of the teaching profession today; so that the education of children in Scotland will not be prejudiced by these events.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This Amendment was tabled for probing purposes, to discover why the Government propose to make this change, which appears to be questionable, and which will lead to some confusion and contradiction, not least in this Bill. The Secretary of State referred to this on Second Reading, but we did not find that explanation satisfactory. We were not able to understand why what appears to be a major change is proposed in this Clause. The hon. Gentleman has not helped us much this morning and we are still very much in the dark.<br><br>
Why is this large change proposed? If it were simply to make educational experiment more possible by introducing into the naming structure of education a new flexibility, then I would have little concern. There are feelings I know, that some of the more excessive forms of experiment should perhaps be resisted. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor), would agree with my own view, which is that we should not resist experiment in education.<br><br>
We may question the wisdom or otherwise of the middle school proposal, but let us see, let us experiment. In this, and other educational ventures in the future, may lie a great challenge and opportunity in education. Let us not, by keeping to some rigid structure of words, endanger experimentation and development. I am certain that my hon. Friend would agree that if we took the view that we should not assist the questing teachers and venturesome local authorities, and schools of imagination to develop new thinking in education, we would produce a uniformity which would tend to be very dull.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman's thinking is conditioned by the fact that the experiments are on living creaturesâ€”</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is helpful, as always. I do not believe that a change as fundamental as this is necessary to create that climate for experiment. Nothing so far said has convinced me that the change is necessary.<br><br>
What concerns me is that all this is part of the sloppy new thinking, emanating from this Government, on what education is about. We had an example of this the other day when the right hon. Gentleman the Secretary of State declared that:
<br><blockquote><p>"School education is one integrated process."â€”[OFFICIAL REPORT, 21st January, 1969; Vol. 776, c. 275.]</p></blockquote>
That was one of the reasons, in his view, for making this change although he recognised that in some respects the old divisions of primary and secondary education would have to be removed. What does this meanâ€”"School education is one integrated process"? Of course it is. Life is one integrated process. I might even say that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) is one integrated process.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. Surely I am entitled to know on what basis that statement is made?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The phrase used by the hon. Member is not included in the list of proscribed words.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0467">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 31</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon. Gentleman knows I am not being offensive. What I am questioning is not the hon. Member for Govan, but the words used by the Secretary of State. He told us that education had been divided into three stages. Life is divided into stages, year, by year. The life of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan is in stagesâ€”he gets younger every year. Of course there are stages in education, and of course education is an integrated process. There is no contradiction here. Education is a constant process for a child, and, of course, it will be a succession of stages, moving from one school to another, from one classroom to another, from Primary I to Primary II.<br><br>
To pretend that by introducing the words "school education" we are removing all possibility of injuring the tender susceptibilities of little children is total nonsense. Of course stages will continue, of course selectivity will continue. There is selectivity in every form of education, and it is no use hon. Gentlemen opposite deluding themselves about it.<br><br>
12 noon.<br><br>
The difficulty is that by introducing the new phrase "school education" we do not make a total change. The Secretary of State the other day, and the Under-Secretary today, explained that the old definitions of primary and secondary education had to remain for various purposes, notably the need to preserve salary scales. This explanation dispelled to some extent the fears that many teachers had that this is a sinister start towards diluting the profession in secondary schools. I accept that this is not so. Nevertheless, I am not happy to have words which will continue to cause doubt.<br><br>
If the new form of words is allowed to stand, two styles of description will be created which will live uneasily side by side. On some occasions there will be references to "school education". On others there will be references to "primary" and "secondary" education. The Government are in danger of creating an inconsistency which will lead to confusion and misunderstanding. It is necessary only to turn to page 3 of the Bill to find primary and secondary education defined yet again.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
There is the problem which will confront parents under Clause 7, where the significance of the difference between primary and secondary education is very real. This is the only moment at which parents will be able to lodge an appeal against the transfer of their child from one school to another. If the concept is introduced, that the child progresses steadily through school education and that primary and secondary education will for many children no longer be relevant, the right of appeal will be lost, because the moment of transition implied in Clause 7 will, if the new form of words takes over, apply no longer. I believe that there is a real danger to the proper and natural rights of parents by moving to this new language.<br><br>
In the end I believe that the wording is sloppy. The Under-Secretary tried to justify it. All that he has succeeded in doing is in presenting himself as a sort of Humpty Dumpty who stated, "When I use a word it means just what I choose it to mean, neither more nor less". "School education" can be interpreted in a variety of ways. I am not sure that all the interpretations are necessarily good ones for education.<br><br>
There is also the grammatical question. I underline what my hon. Friend the Member for Pollok (Mr. Wright) said so skilfully from his great knowledge. I dislike the sloppy use of wordsâ€”what you, Mr. Jennings, so eloquently described as a noun used adjectivally. I do not think there is a case for it in legislation. It has been suggested that this is an advance because the language of today is being introduced into legislation and the words of Statutes are being modernised. I would welcome it if this made for greater precision. I do not welcome it when it makes for less precision. It is the imprecision of these words my hon. Friends and I object to most of all.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When I moved the Amendment I did not expect that it would be necessary to divide on it. During the debate I thought that it might be essential to call a Division if only to bring back the hon. Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) who seemed so keen to hear the Minister, but the hon. Gentleman has not done the Minister the honour of returning to listen to him.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0468">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 33</span>
The Minister's reply was much more disappointing than I expected. Hon. Members on both sides have expressed concern, especially about the position of parents. The Minister brushed aside far too lightheartedly the view of the profession. There is much greater concern than the Minister estimates. He said that there had been talks, and that we should be naive if we thought that there had not been, with the teacher organisations. He did not definitely say that there had been agreement with the teacher organisations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not say what the hon. Gentleman alleges. I said that anyone who imagined that a fundamental change of this sort could be made without talks having taken place with the teacher organisations must be very naive. Of course we have not discussed this particular question with the teacher organisations. What is in the Bill has obviously been discussed with them, but what is in the Bill is nothing to do with the fears expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Springburn (Mr. Buchanan) and those which are now being expressed.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are in some difficulty this morningâ€”[HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] Let me finish what I am saying. Of course, we are usually in some difficulty, but we are in some difficulty this morning with regard to the Division lists, owing to the G.P.O. troubles. I think that our Clerk is to be complimented on the manner in which he has got over them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 3, in page 1, line 19, leave out 'ability and aptitude'.<br><br>
We now move a little closer to the nub of the central argument. At first glance, it may seem a little surprising that the Amendment should be moved.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 34</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I find it difficult to agree that this is nothing to do with what we are discussing. There are definite fears in the profession about this blurring of the top of the primary and the bottom of the secondary into the middle school. As there have been discussions in recent months about another matter, I should have thought that some agreement should have been concluded on this fairly fundamental issue as it affects teachers. I had hoped that the Minister would have been able to say that these fears are groundless. I know that they are not groundless. I am sorry that the Minister had not a much more forceful and clear-cut statement to make to the Committee.<br><br>
For this reason primarily, and because, as I stated at the beginning, this whole Clause is such a nonsense in drafting, I ask my hon. Friends to divide on the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put,</i> That the Amendment be made:â€”</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 9, Noes 14.</p>
<p>I hope that the Minister will appreciate why it is moved. A little earlier he described us as naive. Naivete on this occasion comprises a wish to help him to the utmost of our naive talents. It is in accordance with what I understand the comprehensive principle to be that I move the deletion of these selective words "ability and aptitude". If, as I understand it, it is the real intention of the Bill to enshrine the comprehensive principle in Scottish education, there plainly is no place for a test which will be essential if ability and aptitude are to be judged. In other words, I am putting this in a sympathetic way.</p>
<p>I will increase the stringency of the argument by pointing out what is implied if these words remain in the Bill.

They are by this time sanctified by about 20 years of history. "Age, ability and aptitude" is of the type of phrases which are used in British education. "Ability" and "aptitude" can have meaning only if they can be translated into educational terms.</p>
<p>The hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin), whose absence I gravely deplore, used the language of an old-time religion, one might almost say, when he referred to his views on comprehensive education. He used such phrases as "No child is any less worthy than any other"; "It must fit every ability and every aptitude"; "Every person physically sound and not in the category of special education must be catered for"; and "Jack is as good as his master". Even if these doctrines are acceptedâ€”I am not sure that some of us on this side would not accept many of these doctrinesâ€”the question is: how are they translated into the school situation?</p>
<p>This is where the argument assumes great importance. In a comprehensive age, which we are plainly moving into, how is the use of phrases such as "ability and aptitude" to be reconciled, unless one chooses, unless one selects, unless in some way one examines individual children?</p>
<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
<p>Central to the argument there are two important bits of current research. I refer, first, to the National Foundation for Educational Research, which has been doing a good deal of investigation into comprehensive education. It lists the claims for comprehensive schools under three heads. First,
<br><blockquote><p>"They allow postponement to a later age than eleven"â€”</p></blockquote></p>
<p>this is in the English contextâ€”
<br><blockquote><p>"of a decision concerning a child's future schooling which may restrict his educational and career opportunities."</p></blockquote></p>
<p>Second,
<br><blockquote><p>"Less talent runs to waste because comprehensive schools avoid the class bias inherent in selection procedures, a bias which is present not because of any intention to discriminate but because no one has been able to devise predictive tests which middle-class children do not on the whole do better in than children of manual workers."</p></blockquote></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 36</span>
<p>I emphasise that. No one has yet been able to devise predictive tests which do not in some way discriminate in favour of the children of more affluent members of the community.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John P. Mackintosh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friendâ€”[HON. MEMBERS: "No."]â€”making the case that this type of comprehensive education, the extreme application of the comprehensive doctrine, is what he and his party want to see in Scottish education? If so, I shall be interested to know how he squares that with his defence of certain schools in continuing to charge fees. If they are not to be selective, I cannot reconcileâ€”</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Although I accept the general implication in this context, I must warn the Committee that it must not move on to the question of fees yet.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Jennings. I am merely pointing out to the hon. Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Mackintosh) and his hon. Friends the inherent contradictionâ€”</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mackintosh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the hon. Gentleman's own position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: â€”in this Clause, the inherent contradiction in a Measure which says that there shall be selection by age, ability and aptitude, although it is intended to be comprehensive. The question of age is left in only because age is plainly definable by date of birth. Nothing else is definable according to the very notion of comprehensive education asâ€”though I do not accept the implication of what the hon. Gentleman saysâ€”originally developed.<br><br>
However, I am at this point drawing on the evidence of the National Foundation for Educational Research and its statement of what comprehensive education means. Here we have it stated that predictive tests cannot but give some measure of bonus to the children of more affluent members of the community.<br><br>
The second piece of evidence is of more relevance to Scotland, as anyone who follows the columns of the Education Correspondent of <i>The Glasgow Herald</i> every Monday knows, since he has drawn frequently on Dr. Douglas's research. The National Survey of Health and Development is carrying out a study of a sample
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0470">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 37</span>
of about 5,000 persons born in March, 1946, and Dr. J. W. B. Douglas has written a report of that study in which he concludes:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is by no means certain that the able manual working-class pupils are more favourably placed in comprehensive schools."</p></blockquote>
The leading article in <i>The Times</i> of 22nd October, 1968, from which I am taking these quotations, goes on to point out:
<br><blockquote><p>"Other â€¦ studies suggest that streaming in comprehensives closely reproduces the social class distribution of selection for selective schools, and that comprehensive schoolchildren are no more likely to choose their friends outside socially homogeneous groups than children in selective schools."</p></blockquote>
I suggest to the Minister, therefore, that it is contrary to what I read as the intent of the Bill that he should leave these words "ability and aptitude" in.<br><br>
I take the argument further. How will he judge ability and aptitude along comprehensive lines? Will he leave it entirely to the erratic verdicts of individual schools, headmasters' reports, teachers' reports, and so on? What about the fact that, in terms of the social trend of our times, furthered by the Billâ€”this is a later point to which we will comeâ€”namely, the movement of schools from the centre of cities to the outskirts, which will enforce a degree of social division which is missing at present? All of this will make questions of ability and aptitude far sharper than ever in the past.<br><br>
I refer also to the passage in subsection (2) at the top of page 3, already pointed out by my hon. Friend the Member for Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor), in which the only distinction between primary and secondary education seems to be by age:
<br><blockquote><p>"(<i>a</i>) primary education shall be construed as a reference to school education of a kind which is appropriate â€¦ to the requirements of pupil who have not attained the age of twelve years; (<i>b</i>) secondary education shall be construed as a reference to school education â€¦ appropriate â€¦ to the requirements of pupils who have attained that age".</p></blockquote>
If that is the sole measure, how is it reconcilable with ability and aptitude? if the Minister leaves in the "three A's"â€”age, ability and aptitudeâ€”he will inevitably accept a large measure of selection.<br><br>
Even if the Minister says that there will be no selective testsâ€”though I
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 38</span>
believe that they are essentialâ€”even if he says that there is no automatic segregation of pupils by their own selective process in friends, environment and everything else, how will he enforce this doctrine in the class situation? Obviously, there has to be streaming. One of the first steps which any school teacher takes with a new class is to stream them in one way or another. Does the Minister suggest that there will, therefore, be streaming according to ability and aptitude, and, if he does, how does that fit in with the comprehensive principle?<br><br>
We propose this Amendment to discover from the Minister how he reconciles this phrase from 25 years ago, enshrined in British education, with the logic of his own position. There are fundamental questions touching the character of education here, and we shall be interested to hear the answers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Maclennan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The speech of the hon. Member for Pollok (Mr. Wright) has somewhat mystified the Committee, since the burden of it seems to suggest that he is departing from the declared policy of his party in making a stout defence of comprehensive education.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman was not listening.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maclennan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: However, he stood his argument on its head at the end by admitting the necessity of the very words which he would delete, in saying that, obviously, there has to be streaming. If there is not to be streaming on the basis of aptitude and ability, I should like to know on what basis it will be.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Younger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For a moment, I thought that I should have to explain to the hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Mr. Maclennan) the whole of the argument put by my hon. Friend the Member for Pollok (Mr. Wright), but, fortunately, in his last few words we suddenly discovered that the light had dawned and that he appreciated the point. Our contention is that these words are incompatible not with our view but with the view which the Government are continually thrusting down everyone's throats, including the local authorities', whether they like it or not, the idea that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0471">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 39</span>
education can be and should be totally non-selective and that everyone will have the same sort of education, whatever his ability.<br><br>
I do not object to the principle of comprehensive education. I have always said this, and I say it again now to have it firmly on record. There are many places, many occasions and many conditions in which comprehensive education is desirable, is the best in the circumstances, is the best for the pupils, and is desired by parents and the local education authority. Indeed, throughout our history in Scotland comprehensive education has been the norm rather than the exception, taking the country as a whole. What we object to, and object to very strongly, is the thrusting of a supposed principle of comprehension down everyone's throat, willy-nilly, whether it is wanted or not, whether the local authorities want it, whether it is best for the area and best for the pupils.<br><br>
Lying behind this thrusting of comprehensive education on those who do not wish it is the bogus claim that, by introducing comprehensive education, selectivity can be put out of the window, that no one needs to worry any more whether his child will be selected for one sort of education or another. The brief explanation given by my hon. Friend the Member for Pollok showed that the claim that selectivity can be removed is thoroughly bogus. There is no prospectâ€”the Government's own Bill openly admits itâ€”of selectivity being removed from education, and it is only fair that parents and local authorities should have this brought home to them so that there is no misapprehension.<br><br>
On Second Reading, the Secretary of State made a revealing remark which underlines the point. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"â€¦ the inclusion within an authority's educational system of fee-paying schools which are necessarily selective is impossible to reconcile with the Government's aim of comprehensive secondary education."â€”[OFFICIAL REPORT, 21st January, 1969; Vol. 776, c. 276.]</p></blockquote>
The inclusion of these words "ability and aptitude", words which I myself support, by a Government who make out that a system which is necessarily selective is incompatible with their comprehensive educational principles makes nonsense of the claim that comprehensive education is non-selective.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 40</span>
That is our case on the Amendment, and we want a clear statement from the Minister of whether, in his view, the comprehensive education which is now to be put willy-nilly everywhere in Scotland is selective or not. If it is selective, will he justify that in the light of the Secretary of State's remarks which I have quoted?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alasdair Mackenzie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The object of a Committee stage is to improve the content of a Bill. On the earlier Amendments this morning we had an interesting debate, though not a very edifying one, since those Amendments were less important than this.<br><br>
In my opinion, to delete the reference to aptitude and ability would be a mistake. On the administrative side, it is necessary to have some method to distinguish between various pupils when one comes to the question of grants and bursaries. This has been my experience. I realise that the term came to be used at the time when the 11-plus examination was introduced, but for various reasons I have found that it is a useful method of assessing the qualities of pupils, particularly when grants and bursaries are being awarded.<br><br>
It is necessary at a certain stage to put pupils into categories and to award grants and bursaries which fit them for work to which they are suited. There are times when even parents are misled into thinking that their children should go into a certain profession or job, and it is not always true that pupils are suited to, or that they have the aptitude and ability for, such work. I have known occasions when a pupil has gone forward with a grant to train for a profession and then, at the end of the first year, it has been found that he did not have the required aptitude or ability.<br><br>
For that reason, it is a very useful term. It will not make any difference in the comprehensive scheme. Money will not be spent indiscriminately. I know that the Opposition tabled the Amendment with the best of intentions, but I cannot support it.</span></p>
<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support the Government. I cannot understand hon. Members opposite mixing up what is good educational theory. I wish to refer to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0472">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 41</span>
what has been said by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Wright) and my hon. Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Mackintosh). I got the rough edge of my hon. Friend's tongue during the Second Reading debate when he ridiculed my ideas about selective comprehension. He seems to be under the illusion that a comprehensive school is a school in which everybody is in a single stream. But in a comprehensive school the social mix is as important as the academic mix. I cannot help thinking that, in an endeavour to get at the Government, the Opposition have lost sight of the theory and practice behind the comprehensive school.<br><br>
Of course, selectivity is necessary in a comprehensive school. This is the greatest strength of a comprehensive school. Because there was a social stigma in the old secondary modern school or Scottish junior secondary schoolâ€”</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman agree that it was an educational stigma and not a social stigma?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. There was an educational and a social stigma about the junior secondary school in Scotland. If a boy or girl failed in their "quali" and went to a junior secondary school, there was little or no hope for that boy or girl rising out of the academic mire. Selectivity in a comprehensive school means that if a boy is good at English and bad at mathematics, or <i>vice versa,</i> he can be taken out of the non-academic stream in whatever subject he is good at, and can obtain extra coaching in the subject which he is bad at. This is the great strength of the comprehensive school.<br><br>
If the Opposition had proposed eliminating the question of age, I would have agreed with them, notwithstanding my protestations on the previous Amendment. One of the worst things which happened in the primary school was that when a child got on to the moving belt at 5 years of age, regardless of his aptitude and ability, he had to be at a certain stage in the primary school by the age of 12 in order to sit for the examination to transfer to secondary school. This gave rise to a slowing up of the processes in the primary school. I was always of the opinion that the standards at the primary schools deteriorated when age was substituted for aptitude and ability. One
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 42</span>
has only to remember that the English essay, which was one of the great tests of the old transfer examination, gave way to an outline of a story. The standards went down as a result of a child getting on to the moving belt at 5 years of age and being pushed into a secondary school at the age of 12, whether the child was ready or not.<br><br>
I stress that the great strength of the comprehensive school is it selectivity.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Younger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman explainâ€”he might do it much better than the Ministerâ€”why the Secretary of State said on Second Reading that selectivity was incompatible with the comprehensive system?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend was not referring to selectivity within the comprehensive school. He was referring to selectivity in special schools which have a greater social standing than the State schools.<br><br>
The comprehensive school must be selective and, as I said on Second Reading, I would extend the selectivity in comprehensive schools. If it is not extended, there will not be a social mix, not only in Eastwood, but in Easter-house. The two must be combined in order to achieve the real comprehensive school.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When the hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Wright) spoke to the Amendment I expected that he would indulge in a minute or two of light-hearted badinage about what seemed to be an inconsistency between what we have been saying about comprehensive schools and what is in the Bill, but I was dismayed that he took this Amendment seriously. My dismay arose from the fact that as he spoke it was clear that he had not the slightest idea what the argument on comprehensive education and selectivity was about.<br><br>
This part of the Clause does not deal with secondary schools; it deals with school education as a whole. What we are saying is as relevant for the primary school as for the secondary school. The primary schools are not selective in the sense in which we normally use the term. They are comprehensive in the sense that there is not academic selection, with a few exceptions which we shall deal with later, at the age of entry or, for that matter, at any other time in the primary
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0473">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 43</span>
schools. But it is inherent in what we are doing in the primary schools that the education given to children, both collectively and individually, has regard to their age, ability and aptitude.<br><br>
If the hon. Member for Pollok does not understand that about primary schools, and, indeed, secondary schools, he does not understand what is going on in the schools in Scotland. I recommend that he should read the primary school memorandum issued by the Scottish Education Department in 1965. Not only was this point dealt with specifically, but it is inherent in everything that we were recommending schools to do in terms of the curriculum, the organisation of the school and their attitude to pupils.<br><br>
The argument about comprehensiveness and selectivity is not concerned with whether in the comprehensive school, or any secondary school, regard should be paid to age, ability and aptitude. Obviously, regard should be paid to the age, ability and aptitude of the pupils in a comprehensive school, as in any other school, but the argument about comprehensive education and selectivity does not concern that at all; it concerns something different. The argument is about whether it is sound educationally or in any other way to have a system, as we used to have but which increasingly shall have less in future, whereby at a certain stage in a child's education virtually unchangeable decisions are taken about his ability and aptitude. Those decisions had the effect of channelling pupils into one kind of education or another in a way which was virtually irreversible. The comprehensive system eliminates that selectivity at a particular point of time.<br><br>
Having eliminated that selectivity, and having established comprehensive schools, the phrase which we use in the Bill has a relevance, but not in the sense that, having achieved comprehensive schools, we simply make the same division in the entry to comprehensive schools as used to be made under the old system of junior and senior secondary education, because that would have the effect of bringing within one building types of education formerly given within separate buildings. The traditional Scottish comprehensive school, the phrase which is often used, is basically that kind of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 44</span>
organisation. In other words, one had, not a comprehensive school in the sense in which we use it now, but a multilateral school. There was an academic school and a junior secondary school in the same building, and there was often rigorous selection at 12, which was a good deal more rigorous in some areas than in others where there were separate junior secondary and senior secondary schools.<br><br>
Having got the pupils within the comprehensive school, the question then arises how the initial division of pupils should be made. They have to be divided into classes simply because in most comprehensive schools there are too many of them to be in one class. Should that be done, as it is done in one or two comprehensive schools, or used to be done, but is less and less done, largely on ability grounds? Should it be done in mixed ability groups? Should it be done on the basis of a common course for the first of two years in the comprehensive school? These are relevant arguments which should not, strictly speaking, be expounded on this minor Amendment.<br><br>
There is a tremendous amount of experimentation going on in Scottish comprehensive schools on, for example, the common course. If the hon. Member for Pollok will draw himself away from the N.F.E.R. description of what is happening in comprehensive schools in England and Wales and will read the articles written recently in the Scottish Educational Journal by headmasters of comprehensive schools about the way in which they are organising their common courses, he will find something much more relevant to the Scottish situation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eadie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend confirm that we have the Scottish Council for Educational Research which does all this kind of work?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. My hon. Friend is associated with it.<br><br>
These are very interesting arguments about what happens in a comprehensive school, but they are all related and are relevant to the phrase used in the Clauseâ€”"the age, ability and aptitude" of the pupils. The argument has been about whether we should make a division at a particular age into categories which are then virtually unchangeable and unassailable or eliminate that selective process and not make at any time within the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0474">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 45</span>
school virtually unchangeable decisions about the capacities of pupils and the kind of school education which they should have in the secondary environment. Having made the decision to change from a selective to a comprehensive system of education, a much more fruitful and fundamental argument arises about the organisation of comprehensive schools.<br><br>
I have always made the point that it would be a great mistake, particularly in the Scottish context, when the idea of comprehensive education is so widely accepted among education authorities, teachers, parents and the public, to keep arguing about the question of selectivity at 12 years of age. We must increasingly turn our minds to what is happening in the comprehensive schools, the way in which they organise their curricula, and the way in which they inevitably channel pupils into particular lines of activity and studies for what are in some cases eventually certificate and in other cases non-certificate courses in particular subjects. That is the argument which we should be having and which we are having in the educational world at the moment. There is no real argument in Scottish education circles about selectivity. That has been settled. We are now arguing about what is happening in the comprehensive schools, and it did not seem to me that the hon. Member for Pollok understood the distinction between the two kinds of argument or directed his attention to what is the essential feature of the discussion and argument going on in education in Scotland.<br><br>
12.45 p.m.<br><br>
For those reasons and because, in any case, the Amendment is not moved seriously in the sense that hon. Members opposite want it accepted, I must ask the Committee to turn it down.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to address myself to one point which was raised by the hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Mr. Maclennan), who failed to understand that I was seeking to put myself in the impossible position of being in the mind of the Minister. I was trying to establishâ€”and I got no clarification from himâ€”how he reconciled the comprehensive principle and a real emphasis on ability and aptitude. That is the core of the dilemma. That is the fundamental
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 46</span>
argument, apart from the one which followed on fee-paying schools.<br><br>
I suggest that the Minister is using the phrase "age, ability and aptitude" as an inheritance from the time when selectivity meant selectivity, with examinations and all the paraphernalia of judgment. It meant the risk of a career being wrecked by a false decision made at too early an age. I accept the existence of that risk, and I believe that there is a strong case to be made for the comprehensive principle.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Leave it there.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Exactly, leave it there. What we mean by "comprehensive" is the core of the debate.<br><br>
Throughout the speeches from hon. Members opposite, a series of contradictions have been made. We had the hon. Member for Glasgow, Springburn (Mr. Buchanan) and his idea of selective comprehension. What are we to understand by that? We heard this morning that the great strength of the comprehensive school is its selectivity. We are dealing with contradictions. By leaving in ability and aptitude, in great measure the Minister is accepting the very selectivity which it is one of the intentions of the Bill to destroy. The Minister has not reconciled the paradox and, if he is being honest to himself, he will delete "ability and aptitude" as well.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Spring-burn talked about the vast difference between education in Eastwood and that in Easterhouse. The assumption throughout the speeches of hon. Members opposite is that we are discussing an idyllic comprehensive school which is large and lavish and to which children go according to their genuine abilities and aptitudes. The realities are quite contrary to that. Comprehensive education in Britain has tended to be the organisation of existing and often dilapidated buildings a quarter, a half, and sometimes three-quarters of a mile apart, and describing it as comprehensive education.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is talking about the realities of the situation. Can he give me examples of comprehensive schools in Scotland which are organised in separate buildings half a mile or three-quarters of a mile apart?
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0475">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 47</span>
I know of only one such school, and its buildings are neither old nor dilapidated. They were built in the last five or six years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that great progress has been made with comprehensive educationâ€”</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am asking a specific question. Where are these schools in Scotland in which comprehensive education is done in separate buildings which are old and dilapidated and half a mile apart? Can we have some examples?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am saying to the Minister that the plan of comprehensive education, which is the project implicit in this Bill, is that there will be a situationâ€”</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not asking about that. The answer to my question is "No". The hon. Gentleman does not know of any such schools, and he does not know of any such schools because there is none in Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister is seriously presenting to us the case that we shall have a system of comprehensive education in which existing schools will be called "comprehensive"â€”</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not. The hon. Gentleman said, "Let us get down to the realities and away from the idyllic situation." I am dealing with realities. We are not doing these things. I have asked him to give examples. There is none to give. If he would only inform himself about what is happening in Scottish education, instead of dealing with theoretical concepts, we might get a profitable exchange of views.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am suggesting that the situation which we face as far ahead as we can see is one in which existing schools of all types, many of them inadequate, will be lumped together and called comprehensive schools. I agree that much has been done by both parties. Some of our schools are new and splendid. I am saying that the cost of this form of comprehensive education is itself an appalling burden. In realistic terms, it is bound to mean, in present circumstances, the acceptance of the existing situation in great measure. Every argument put forward from the benches
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 48</span>
opposite is an acceptance of streaming and selectivity in the operation of the schools.<br><br>
With some reluctance, I am bound to say that I do not accept the Minister's view that ability and aptitude can be reconciled with the comprehensive principle. For that reason, I press my Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is not facing the realities of Scottish education as they are at present. His description of what has happened in comprehensive reorganisation is a travesty. He need not accept that from me, because he can ask any education authority in Scotland if his description is accurate. He will be told that it is completely inaccurate. In any case, although he says a lot, he does not answer the fundamental questions.<br><br>
He says that he is in favour of the comprehensive concept in principle, and he wants to leave it there, as my hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) has said. But is he in favour of selectivity at 12 years of age? Presumably he is not. However, in a subsequent Amendment no doubt we shall have a long discussion about fee-paying schools, which are inherently selective. I would have more respect for hon. Gentlemen opposite if they said that they do not favour comprehensive reorganisation, because we could have a profitable argument then about the direction in which Scottish education is moving. Instead, they say that they favour comprehensive education, but they also favour selectivity. They say that there will be selectivity in comprehensive schools, anyway. They do not say whether that is good or bad or whether the selection should be the same kind as we have now where irreversible decisions are made about a pupil's abilities and aptitudes at the age of 12. Should comprehensive education be organised on a multilateral basis or not? We want to know whether hon. Gentlemen opposite think that is good or bad or whether we should reduce the element of selectivity, increase it, or allow it to develop as it is at present. None of these fundamental questions has been answered. In the time remaining, perhaps we can have some answers to them. We might then know what the argument is about.</span></p>

Gentleman is trying to make out that all forms of comprehensive reorganisation in Scotland are taking place in properly built comprehensive schools with adequate facilities, and not in old schools which are inadequate for the purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eadie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He did not say that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Younger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He asked my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Wright) to produce examples where that was not the case. Perhaps he can comment on the current scheme being put into effect in Ayr where four existing schools, without any alteration, are being jumbled together and the whole system called "comprehensive".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Millan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point is that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollok was repeating an argument which is familiar in England but which has no relevance to the situation in Scotland. An argument which can be used in London, for example, is that there are comprehensive schools made up of secondary modern and grammar schools which may be a mile apart and which are put together to form some kind of comprehensive school. It is not my responsibility to say whether or not that works satisfactorily in London. It is a familiar argument advanced by critics of the English comprehensive system, and the hon. Gentleman was applying it to the Scottish situation. I am aware of only one example in Scotland of separate buildings which are some distance apart. However, they are not old and dilapidated buildings. One of them was built in 1965, and one in 1966.<br><br>
Of course, there are comprehensive schools in old buildings. There are old junior secondary schools which have been built up to comprehensive schools. Similarly, there are old senior secondary schools which have been converted into comprehensive schools. In all cases, the conversion has been made as part of a genuine system of reorganisation produced by the education authority concerned and agreed to by the Secretary of State. If there are any of these makeshift schemes to which the hon. Gentleman has referred, I would like to know
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 50</span>
Where they are. If the hon. Gentleman can produce examples, I shall be surprised.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Having listened to hon. Gentlemen opposite throughout this morning's debate, my fear is that they do not mean what they say. I think that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Wright) gave the case away when he accepted my few words of offering to him. It was easy to see what was behind his protestions. Clearly, the acceptance of comprehensive education in principle would satisfy him. But where would he go from there? Would he leave it hanging there? I am prepared to accept selectivity, so long as it is left thereâ€”</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In principle.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: â€”So long as it is not applied anywhere. Perhaps we could have a meeting of minds on it, although it would get us nowhere. There is no application to the realities of life, to changes of process, or to social, educational and economic requirements. Would he leave it dangling in space, weightless and in a vacuum? Is that really what is in his mind?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure what precise question is to be left dangling in the firmament. The hon. Gentleman is talking about comprehensive education in principle, but, as I understand it, nothing more than that. My argument is about the translation of those concepts into reality. What does comprehensive education mean in the schools? The core of what I have said is that, in the end, comprehensive education becomes some form of selection. After all, that is part of the process of living. There is a fundamental paradox here.<br><br>
May I make one other point, because the Ministerâ€”</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman will allow me to make my speech. I had not finished.<br><br>
May I remind him that he could possibly secure what he would immediately protest is not the purpose of his Amendment by saying that no regard should be

had to the ability or aptitude of such pupils? If it is only acceptance in principle, there is no application to the realities of lifeâ€”</span></p>
