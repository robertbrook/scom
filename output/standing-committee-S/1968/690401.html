Clause 1</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
SURVEY OF PLANNING DISTRICTS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 1, in page 1, line 12, leave out 'in any event'.<br><br>
This is an Amendment which I am sure the Minister will recognise as a drafting Amendment. Unless there is any great significance in the words "in any event", which do not appear to add to the sense of the sentence, we propose that they should be left out. If they have any particular significance we shall be grateful if the Minister can say what it is.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Dr. J. Dickson Mabon)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We thought that these words would be useful in as much as they refer back to the phrase in line 10
<br><blockquote><p>"in so far as they have not already done so"</p></blockquote>
but I concede that they could be regarded as only of an explanatory nature and that they could be removed without any damage to the Clause. Accordingly, I accept the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is the happiest omen at the opening of a Committee stage. I htave never had such good fortune before, and I doubt whether many hon. Members have. I am glad that the Government feel able to accept the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. N. R. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This Clause, like Clause 2, is one of the more significant Clauses in the Bill, and, as I understand it, it is intended to replace Section 3 of the 1947 Act. Section 3 of the 1947 Act combined the corresponding provisions of the first two Clauses of this Bill in so far as it imposed a statutory duty on local planning authorities firstly to carry out a survey of their district, and then, within three years after the appointed day or such later period as permitted, to prepare and submit a development plan.<br><br>
Now these two obligations are repeated in the Bill, with the exception that at this stage of the Bill we are concerned with a structure plan, and much of what can be said on Clause 1 is likely to overlap with what is bound to be raised on Clause 2. I should like to know if there is any peculiar significance in the splitting up of the obligation to carry out a survey and the obligation to prepare and submit a structure plan as it is set out in this Bill, in contrast, as I have indicated, to the provisions of the 1947 Act.<br><br>
We are anxious to co-operate as much as we possibly can with this Bill, as was clearly indicated at Second Reading, but much of the Bill is going to require detailed and careful explanation. Provided we get these explanations we are going to co-operate as much as we can.<br><br>
The Committee ought to remember that Clause 102 provides for the coming into operation of this Bill on an appointed day, and there may be different days appointed for different Clauses—Sections of the Act, as it will be. Clause 102 reads as follows:
<br><blockquote><p>"This Act shall come into operation on a day appointed by an order made by statutory instrument by the Secretary of State …"</p></blockquote>
So for a start the Bill itself is not going to come into operation when it receives the Royal Assent. The whole thing is going to be governed by the Statutory Instrument to which I have just referred. The Clause goes on:
<br><blockquote><p>"… and different days may be appointed under this section for different purposes …"</p></blockquote>
Presumably that means that the Government have in mind bringing certain Clauses of this Bill into operation before others are brought into operation. The Clause goes on:
<br><blockquote><p>"… and, in particular, different days may be so appointed for the coming into operation of the same provision in different areas."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0823">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
That rather suggests not only that different Clauses are to be brought in at different times but that it is envisaged that there will be a geographical phasing of the application of the legislation, and that it is contemplated bringing the legislation in for the purposes of certain areas while delaying its application to other areas.<br><br>
I would like to know at this stage whether the fact that the obligation to carry out a survey is embodied in one Clause, and the statutory duty to prepare and submit a structure plan is embodied in another Clause, means that it is contemplated that Clause 1 is likely to be brought into effect before Clause 2?<br><br>
Secondly, we would like to know, is it envisaged that even in the obligation of Clause 1—that is the statutory duty to carry out the survey—that that is an obligation which is to be applied to certain local planning authorities at the outset and not to others? I think this is important, because, as was conceded by the Minister at Second Reading, and indeed by the Government at an earlier stage in another place, it appears to be recognised that not all local planning authorities as at present constituted would be able to carry out their obligations under Clause 1, let alone the much more detailed and complicated obligations under Clause 2.<br><br>
What worries us about Clause 1 is that the criteria which have to be taken into account in the survey, the things which have to be looked at in the preparation of the survey, are complex, and that most local planning authorities do not at present have the expertise adequately to fulfil that function. This, of course, is where a discussion on Clause 1 tends to overlap with the discussion on Clause 2, because the same problem arises there, only to a greater extent. I think we ought to know at the beginning what the Government's intentions are in this direction.<br><br>
Is it envisaged that the obligation to promote a survey of the district will be imposed only on the major planning authorities in Scotland? Or, alternatively, is it envisaged that it is to be imposed on all planning authorities, but that the smaller authorities are going to be expected to get together on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis for the purpose of preparing this
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
survey? Unless they do so, I do not see how they could possibly meet the requirements of this Clause.<br><br>
In subsection (4) of this Clause there is a statutory duty on the local planning authority, for the purpose of discharging its functions under this Clause, of
<br><blockquote><p>"examining and keeping under review any matters relating to the district of another such authority"</p></blockquote>
and there is a duty to consult with the other authority. I have run up against difficulties in the past in regard to much more limited statutory obligations for consultation between local authorities. The statutory obligations for local authorities to consult with adjoining authorities only arises where there is perimeter development in the one which is likely to effect existing land uses in the other. If one runs up against difficulties in practice with that very limited obligation for consultation, I am slightly concerned about how subsection (4) is to operate when there is a wide duty of consultation between local authorities, and how that is going to be interpreted. These are not matters which we felt it was possible to submit to Amendment, but the very wide terms of subsection (4) do carry with them the kind of latent difficulties to which I have referred.<br><br>
I would just remind the Committee that, whatever may be said about how it is intended that this Clause and this legislation generally is to work, we are dealing here in Clause 1 with obligations imposed on local planning authorities, and local planning authorities mean the local planning authorities set out in Section 2 of the 1947 Act. Indeed, it is the problem of setting up regional bodies to deal with what are really regional responsibilities and problems, both in Clause 1 and in Clause 2, which we feel is one of the more serious shortcomings of this legislation as a whole.<br><br>
These are some preliminary observations on Clause 1 about which I think the Committee would wish to have the Minister's views.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. A. Woodburn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must congratulate the drafters of this Bill in making it so clear that the hon. and learned Gentleman has been able to explain it so clearly to us after reading it this morning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I read it last night.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have no doubt that the Minister, in explaining the point, will be able to repeat the hon. and learned Gentleman's speech almost word for word. The only thing that is the matter with this legislation and these powers is, that they are about fifty years too late.<br><br>
10.45 a.m.<br><br>
When we come to the historical buildings part of the Bill I can assure the hon. and learned Gentleman that one of the relevant problems will be that we find valuable buildings stuck in the way of great major road developments, and one has either got to divert a road or remove on ancient building. If all this had been foreseen as Professor Patrick Geddes, whom we honour as being the father of town and country planning, foresaw it, the country would have been organised in a more efficient and amenable way than has been the case in the past. The idea of people's houses being situated next door to stables and dairies with flies all over the place is not the ideal of planning. It is important that at the earliest possible moment the Government and the planning authorities should have powers to enable them to arrive at some sort of idea of how the country will develop.<br><br>
It is easy to imagine all the difficulties which might arise, but if we were to legislate for all the possible difficulties, then we would never have any Bill at all. I hope that the hon. and learned Gentleman will accept my assurance drawn from my experience that no Secretary of State tries to compel a local authority to do what is impossible. If it is impossible, the local authority cannot do it, and therefore no Secretary of State can compel it to do it. The Secretary of State and the local authorities work in considerable harmony in these matters, but it is agreed that there are local authorities which need gingering up if one wants them to do anything at all.<br><br>
It is important, therefore, that this power should exist. I hope that the powers in the Bill will not be tied up with too many imaginary strings. I am sure that any difficulties which arise will be dealt with, and if there are particular problems they can be dealt with by Amendment. The hon. and learned Gentleman is foreseeing problems which will no doubt be solved when they arise.<br><br>

There will be time enough to cross these bridges when we come to them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Younger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to to confine myself to the question of setting up surveys. Although in some respects I agree with the right hon. Gentleman that this legislation may be fifty years too late, I feel that in other respects it is about ten years too early. The real trouble is that the admirable provisions of Clause 1 cannot, and will not, have an effect till the Wheatley proposals have been implemented. I gather from various statements by the Government that it will be a period of between five to ten years before any such proposals can be brought in.<br><br>
I wish to raise one or two questions on subsection (4). I am in favour of the idea that local planning authorities can take a survey of their own area and can consult with neighbouring local authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Dempsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They are already doing it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Younger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They are already doing it, as the hon. Member says. This is an excellent thing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dempsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Since the passing of the Town and Country Planning Act, 1947, there have always been consultations between authorities who boundaries are contiguous. I am surprised to hear the hon. Gentleman say that this sort of understanding has not existed in Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Younger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure the hon. Gentleman would have been surprised if I had made any suggestion that such an understanding did not exist in Scotland, but I have said no such thing, nor do I intend to say such a thing, because such a statement would not be correct. Consultation between local planning authorities is quite normal and so it should be.<br><br>
I am worried about the Clause because I believe that preparation of an area survey cannot be carried out satisfactorily within the narrow confines of the present local government areas. I feel strongly that in order to make this legislation effective there must be larger planning units. We cannot wait for ten years when all sorts of massive proposals are now being put forward. It is not sufficient
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0825">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
for this Bill, excellent as it is, to be superimposed on the old-fashioned boundaries of local authorities.<br><br>
The present local authority boundaries today have no relevance to the way in which people are living and working in Scotland. People travel across one county, into another county, across two or three counties and back again, for the purposes of work, recreation and all the rest. We cannot leave planning for the next ten years to the mercies of this Bill combined with the present local government areas.<br><br>
I am not being critical of the Minister in this matter, but I am seeking to be helpful. I suggest that the Minister must give very much more thought to what is to happen within the next ten years. He must devise some new machinery to co-ordinate all the existing planning authorities into <i>ad hoc</i> bodies in order to cover larger regions within the limited period between now and the time when the Wheatley proposals are implemented. This will be difficult to arrange, but the Scottish Office must think up some way of carrying it out.<br><br>
The point may be illustrated by the current exciting and far-reaching proposals which are now being discussed for development of the Clyde estuary. Great interest has been shown in these proposals, and we hope that many people will be led to come to Scotland to help to develop our natural resources.<br><br>
If we are all agreed upon this sort of project and are anxious to get it through, there is then the awful prospect of trying to carry out this whole massive development through a patchwork of existing authorities which, each in its own small sphere, is trying to do its best to forward these developments. There is a strong case for one unified regional planning <i>ad hoc</i> body to be set up for a limited period of time in order to help in the transition between the present time and the time in the future when the new larger local authority areas are introduced.<br><br>
I shall not go into the details of how these <i>ad hoc</i> bodies should be organised or what their responsibility should be, but we must find a way to set up such a body, with power to look at the larger region as a whole and to assess various competing considerations. Careful
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
thought should be given to the siting of a power station here or there, or an oil refinery here or there, and other equally important matters, such as the effect upon the amenities produced by these developments, also need to be taken into account. Such a body as I envisage could assess the various conflicting rights and wrongs and decide whether amenity will be more adversely affected by one development as against another.<br><br>
My suggestion perhaps poses more questions than it answers. However, we cannot go through the next ten years with this patchwork arrangement, under modern town and country planning legislation combined with old-fashioned local authority boundaries. We must find a bridging solution by means of a temporary authority which will co-ordinate activities over the next ten years. I am sure that my hon. Friends and I will be willing to co-operate in any method which seeks to make such a procedure work, for we cannot leave things as they are at the moment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Lawson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Much as I sympathise with what both hon. Members have put forward as their aims, it seems to me that they are upside down. They are describing activities which never happen. If one looks at how things actually happen, at how men plan, one finds that they plan as occasion arises and as difficulties present themselves. On occasion men may be able to see far ahead, but those occasions are few. A long-term plan is really a paper plan, a plan which requires immense modification. In many cases such a plan never comes to fruition. I feel that the provisions of the Bill show the right way to go about the matter.<br><br>
There are obvious problems involved in planning matters. Hon. Members opposite have described the breakdown of boundaries and the inadequacy of the present planning machinery. The hon. Gentleman the Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) seemed to be saying, "Let us set up the ideal planning organisation, and then it will plan". This is not how things happen. Think of how any great organisation has grown up from small beginnings. Think, for example, of the intricate railway system. Suppose somebody had sat down in the first place to try to plan it all, what chaos there would
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0826">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
have been. Such an organisation has its beginnings in small ways, with bits added, and modifications. Human beings muddle along. It is surprising how far we have come over the years, how intricate and involved it all is, and yet how efficient men's organisations are. There are now living on this planet thousands of millions of people. This could only have come about because of the growth of the institutions and through the improvement of ways by which human beings have survived.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Archie Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is launching upon a wide survey, but when he mentions railways he must recognise that most of the difficulties have occurred because of commercial interests which interfered with planning, and because of the competition there was between the railway companies. Because sane planning has returned these difficulties have now largely disappeared.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lawson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The paper plan comes in instead of practical reality. Here is the job we have to do. Let us examine the minimum organisation required to do the job efficiently, rather than to set up castles in the air. Certain things require to be done now and this is what my right hon. Friend is seeking to do in this Bill. We cannot wait ten years. The hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Glasgow, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) does not wish to impose upon authorities a task which it is impossible for them to carry out, but in many ways the imposing of a difficult task leads the people in question to devise a means to carry it out. The root of the matter is that there are tasks to be carried out and some local authorities will go a certain distance in carrying out such tasks. They will realise their inadequacies and will tend to surmount them and to improve the machinery for carrying out the job.<br><br>
I feel that my right hon. Friend is starting on this matter from the right end. He is not upside down in this matter as are the hon. Gentlemen opposite. I hope that when the Minister replies he will tell us that he has in mind modest but effective measures which can branch out quickly—more quickly than if we have to wait for the castles in the air, which will tumble down before anything can be done.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Younger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely what the hon. Gentleman is arguing is that we should legislate to muddle along. Surely we can do a lot better than that?</span></p>
<p>11.0 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Dickson Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In 13 years?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lawson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It might seem the wrong way of putting it if one uses the word "muddle" in a derogatory sense but this is how human beings, even the most intelligent human beings act. It is a question of trial and error, of seeing the problems and seeking to meet them.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman mentioned the Clyde estuary. How did those authorities come together on the Clyde estuary question? Because there was a problem which became obvious to all of them and particularly to the Minister of State and his colleagues. Various steps were taken to induce them to come together. There is a larger problem obvious to all of us who come from the Clyde Valley, that what happens in the estuary will powerfully affect the importance of the existing industrial life in Lanarkshire as well as in Ayrshire and Renfrewshire. It is not just a question of stopping at the estuary but of considering other parts of the Clyde Valley and thinking in terms of the implications of changes and of steps to meet those changes and of not getting into the muddle which comes from not taking effective steps in time. But one does not take effective steps in time by putting a towel round one's head and thinking and thinking and thinking without being in touch with the problems. I think my hon. Friend is going about it the right way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Motherwell (Mr. Lawson) is critical of my hon. Friend, but we accept that Clause 1 has a great deal of merit. It is its practical application about which we are worried—the timetable, and whether the resources are available. I hope that the Minister of State will be able to relieve our worries and indicate whether those local authorities and other authorities which will, no doubt, have to do the structure plans will be in a position to do so in the near future. My hon. Friend the Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) is a little critical in that he feels—and I share his feelings—that if we do not have the top tier authorities soon—
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0827">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
and nobody knows the future structure—there may in the long run be a delay which is unacceptable. It is the timetable we are worried about.<br><br>
At Second Reading of the Bill the Minister indicated that the new structure plans were similar to the present development plans. I wonder if we should not have inserted "development plan" rather than "structure plan" if only to reduce any doubt which might be in the minds of the public, because it has taken them a long time to begin to understand planning legislation, and just as they are reaching that point they are having to learn all over again. If we had stuck to "development plan" there would have been only one type of plan in their minds.<br><br>
Does the Minister of State, in the near future, following the passage of this Bill, mean that local authority planning committees should set about re-writing present development plans as soon as possible or does he just think that a modification is indicated? Looking at Clause 1 one supposes that what the Minister is thinking of is a much more detailed plan than the present development plan. All of us have probably seen the development plans for our own local authorities. Having seen my own, I would think that what the Minister has in mind is of much greater detail and complexity. This raises the question of whether the staff is available to do this work when it is at full stretch at present dealing with planning applications without turning its mind to Clause 2 and structure plans.<br><br>
We must consider the staff and there are two ways of doing this. Should the structure plan be prepared by the present staff living in the area with the problems, or by an outside body such as those which did the Clyde Estuary development plan or the Moray Firth plan? I think we should, basically, employ the staff at present in the areas, because they know the areas and the difficulties involved. Staff is so critical a question to Clauses 1 and 2 that I hope the Minister of State will speak at considerable length on this.<br><br>
Tied in on this, on Clause 1, we have the question of proper consultation. Once we get to the question of consultation on the structure plan we are in very large areas indeed. In Dumfries we are at present in close consultation with the Stewartry, Wigtownshire, Dumfriesshire
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
and Galloway. On a structure plan we would have to bring in the whole area, including even Cumberland, and consider whether we should include consultation with English local authorities. With the present staff position this is not something we can view with complacency at present. There will have to be quite an increase of planning officers to carry out Clauses 1 and 2.<br><br>
I think the Minister of State has the broad idea right in Clauses 1 and 2. We should have the surveys and the two plans. It is the practical implications which are causing me concern, but they are something which can be overcome.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Doig</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised at the comments of the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) about the larger regional planning unit. He talks about people crossing boundaries. If he makes a larger unit, does he think nobody will cross the boundaries then? If he made the size the whole of Great Britain there would still be people crossing the boundaries.<br><br>
The idea behind this is that it is better to have a larger regional planning unit, but our vast experience of regional planing has not been good. If we consider the present regional structure, in Dundee, when we went on to a regional planning unit for water, we found it cost much more than before—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Clark Hutchison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Much more in Edinburgh.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not in real terms.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doig</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I assure the Minister of State that this is a fact. We have much more difficulty in getting complaints dealt with, and more difficulty in finding the people in charge, because they are away from us.<br><br>
Our experience of regional control is not happy, and this is not something which I favour. We have a national plan and a scheme into which the smaller units have to fit, but surely the most obvious smaller units are the local authorities. In other words, the people paying for this should have control of it. If there is to be re-planning of the City of Dundee who will be paying for it? The ratepayers of Dundee. Then why consult Angus, Fife and Perthshire and all around when they are not paying for it at all? If one has a unit, it should be on the basis that the people who pay for it will
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0828">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
make the decisions and have the control. This is a much more sensible way of doing it.<br><br>
There is ample provision in this Clause for consulting neighbouring authorities where it becomes necessary. Subsection (4) says:
<br><blockquote><p>A local planning authority shall, for the purpose of discharging their functions under this section of examining and keeping under review any matters relating to the district of another such authority, consult with that other authority about those matters.</p></blockquote>
So, as it stands, there is ample provision for consultation with neighbouring authorities where necessary, but to try to extend the region into a bigger region as the hon. Gentleman opposite suggested would have the effect that the ratepayers would not be consulted at all. It is all right to consult Angus, Perth and Fife if they help to pay, but they are going to be outside the area which is going to pay, and they should have no say other than the broad general say which the Government have, that it should be for the good of the nation as a whole.<br><br>
The regional system has been publicised as a great thing when it is not that at all. Every regional organisation working now is working less efficiently than did the organisations which were operating before the regional body was set up.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope my hon. Friends will not be alarmed if I venture to put a few questions, in a few carefully chosen words. I would like to ask first of all if we could have a little more background on Clause 1. What proportion of local authorities are not already implementing the requirements of Clause 1? Is it a quarter, a half or three-quarters? I would be very interested to know if there are many already failing in this requirement? I wonder also whether they are mainly urban or rural local authorities?<br><br>
11.15 a.m.<br><br>
This has some bearing on what sort of problems local authorities will have to face, particularly in terms of what my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) was saying, that there are additional requirements for staff to carry out surveys which are suggested. For instance, what additional staff might be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
required in a local authority such as Edinburgh Corporation? I do not know whether the Corporation has given its views to the Minister on this, but I am sure we would all be interested to hear them.<br><br>
Does the Minister visualise that more use may be made in the future of universities to carry out the procedure laid down in Clause 1? We have recently had a good example in the report on the Borders, which covered more than one local authority area and which was carried out by a university team. This overcame the problem mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) when he referred to the confined areas with which local authorities have to deal.<br><br>
If I may touch on the valid point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr, which was missed by the hon. Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Doig), about what happens after the implementation of the Report of the Royal Commission on Local Government, it is relevant to ask the Minister of State whether the Clause will be capable of meeting that situation if, as we suspect, the result of the Wheatley recommendations is to produce larger local authority areas or larger planning areas. It may be that it is sufficient for this purpose. I have much sympathy with what the hon. Member for Motherwell (Mr. Lawson) said in this context. It is right that we should look upon what we are doing as part of an evolutionary process, whereby we are learning all the time by our past mistakes, and going ahead from there. In that respect the Clause is probably fairly sensible, and I go some way with what he said.<br><br>
If the Minister will answer these questions, it will help to clear our minds.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I find the Bill rather difficult to read because of the way in which it is written, and I make no apology for saying so. I have sympathy with what the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) said, and the suggestion that it might have been better if the Bill had been deferred till the Royal Commission on Local Government has reported. Although that is a criticism, I have some sympathy with it.<br><br>
I have been reading the observations of the Planning Advisory Group. This
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0829">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
is an extremely interesting publication and I would recommend it to Members of the Committee. It made some good recommendations. It speaks of the present system, and the Bill is the result of the review by the Government of existing planning regulations. The publication says this:
<br><blockquote><p>"Any review must start with an assessment of the present system set up under the Town and Country Planning Act, 1947."</p></blockquote>
It goes on to say this:
<br><blockquote><p>"When introduced, it was the most advanced system in the world, and it still retains much of its strength."</p></blockquote>
This is to the credit of the legislators of the day who were sufficiently far-seeing to pass that Measure. The publication goes on to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"Planning is criticised on two main grounds, the delays it incurs and the quality of its results."</p></blockquote>
That is pretty succinct, and pretty true.<br><br>
On the question of consultations, it must be recognised that Glasgow is at present undertaking one of the most ambitious projects in Europe in communications. Glasgow in its present position with these ambitions cannot be looked upon as a normal local authority, nor can it be governed by ordinary rules of planning such as will be used to govern most local authorities in planning. For instance, the city has 29 redevelopment areas. It would be most unfortunate if the Bill reacted against Glasgow, or any city in a similar position which had ambitious projects, so as to prohibit future development.<br><br>
Harking back to Glasgow again on the matter of consultation, the present administration is progressive in more senses than one, but, nevertheless, in the full knowledge that the Bill was coming before the House and of the implications of it, Members of Parliament were asked to attend a meeting on the Sunday prior to the introduction of the Bill. Second Reading is long past, and yet no information has come from the present administration that would allow the Members of Parliament for that city to speak for the city.<br><br>
I welcome the Bill, but there is much in it that I do not understand and I hope the Minister in replying will clarify many of my doubts.<br><br>
I was deeply impressed by the report of the P.A.G. and I hoped that its
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
recommendations on planning would find a place in the Bill. I welcome the Bill. It will make a tremendous contribution to the future development of the country. My only reservation at the moment is my fear that Glasgow will be considered as just another local authority and that developments which are already in hand will be restricted. I hope that the Minister will set my doubts at rest.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The main burden of the argument of the hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) who opened the debate was the difficulties which he had experienced and which he foresaw in consultations between planning and other authorities. The hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) raised a real point here. We have been in local government and we know the difficulty of securing planning staff. The hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) gave a wide-ranging survey of the position. He knows how many staff he will get and when. But for a long time, even when I was a member of a county council, it has been very difficult to get staff. I do not know whether it is because of the legal training of the hon. and learned Member for Pentlands but in every debate he brings forward arguments about difficulties which may be experienced. It may be grist to the mill, since legislation of this character may, if we are not careful, result in lawyers doing very well.<br><br>
I have had lengthy local government experience in the consultations of planning authorities with neighbouring authorities. There are many burghs within the County of Ayr which were always consulted on plans for housing or industry in each burgh, and there were no complaints, and I am sure the same thing happens in Lanarkshire and elsewhere.<br><br>
Because of the shortage of staff, many major planning authorities have had difficulty in meeting the wishes of respective Secretaries of State in submitting a survey plan for the district. I would like to know how many major planning authorities have completed the survey of every small burgh and urban district in their areas, and how many, after all these years, still have only partly completed it. I imagine that the staff difficulty has been the main reason for the surveys not being carried out.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0830">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
Members of the Committee have said that it would be wrong for districts to be too small. I think that a county is a fairly large area for which to plan, with all its domestic problems, and those of the local authorities within it. It may be that some local authorities will eventually be wiped out, but the Bill would still cover the larger local government areas.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman agree that the plan for the Central Borders is a good example of the necessity to overlap into other local authority areas to obtain a comprehensive picture?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I am all for this. The outstanding example is of the Clyde Valley local authorities, who came together under existing legislation, and all contributed to the cost of the major plan. My difficulty is that so many people think of this as an accomplished fact, whereas it is merely a plan for the area. Public relations are so bad that it is thought that the projects are already there instead of being merely planning suggestions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Younger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is slightly missing the point. He says that he thinks a county is a very large area to plan. This is quite true, but would not he agree that a large county is a large area to plan, but a small county is a small area to plan?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely. I was referring to the large county. Some counties are far too small, for example, Clackmannan, which is so ably represented by my right hon. Friend, and I think that he would accept this.<br><br>
In the new concept there will possibly be two or three counties together. In the Highlands, in Argyll and Inverness-shire, it sometimes takes a week for a member to attend a two-day county council meeting, with all the time that it takes to travel there and back. The south of Scotland can, for the purposes of planning, be treated differently from the Highlands of Scotland. There is a fear that these areas may be too small. Since the 1947 Act plans have been fed to the Secretary of State for Scotland. He oversees all the plans and they must dovetail into one another. Therefore, we
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
need not have too much fear on this score. Clause 1(4) is wide enoough for the purpose which we envisage.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister of State will give us information to enable us to judge whether, once the Bill becomes law, it will be more successful in getting most of Scotland planned into the master plan which is to be approved by the Secretary of State for Scotland. I hope that he will tell me that there are many district plans, although many areas may not have completed the survey, and the result, therefore, will be rather patchy. This must make it difficult to plan ahead for the whole of Scotland.<br><br>
I am greatly encouraged with the success of the Clyde Valley study. Everyone must be tremendously bucked by this. I pay tribute to the major planning authorities who have got together and have highlighted the great possibilities for the area, especially for Ayrshire and Renfrewshire, and which, in the long term, will be to the great benefit of Scotland.</span></p>
<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This has been an interesting debate and, being such an important Clause, it is right that hon. Members should have asked a number of questions. I am glad to note, however, that, in the context of the proposals, the Clause seems acceptable to the Committee.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Bridgeton (Mr. James Bennett) and a number of hon. Members representing Glasgow constituencies concentrated on the question of consultation. I assure them that there have been lengthy consultations with local authorities about the Bill. The Report of the Planning Advisory Group for the Glasgow area came out four years ago. That Report has been discussed by local authorities, and in 1967 I called a conference of all local authorities to discuss the application of the provisions of the Bill. That conference was held in Edinburgh, valuable consultations occurred, and it should be remembered that, at that time, we were still drafting the Bill.<br><br>
Prior to that conference a working party had been set up comprised of senior officials of the local authority associations and certain local authorities. I am glad to report that officials of Glasgow did a great deal of work to help us

in framing the Bill. Since then, from the 57 planning authorities in Scotland we have received occasional representations from individual authorities, but I pay tribute, as I did at Second Reading, to the Association of County Councils for the painstaking way in which it went through the Bill and made proposals to the Government about amending it. This is, no doubt, why hon. Members will not have received as many communications as they might have expected about the Bill from bodies in their constituencies and others. The reason is simply that so much preparation work was done.<br><br>
I accept, having said that, that some people are disappointed with the Bill and that even at this late stage Glasgow Corporation has asked to discuss certain aspects of it with us. I appreciate that it must have been difficult for hon. Members who represent Glasgow constituencies to be asked to discuss a matter like this on a Sunday after the Second Reading had taken place and just before the Bill was going into Committee. I assure the Committee that Ministers are anxious to co-operate and discuss matters.<br><br>
Naturally, we could not have meetings at this stage with all the 57 planning authorities. After all, the Bill has gone through the Lords. Nevertheless, we will do our best to meet the legitimate requests of any authority, however tardy it may have been in coming forward with its suggestions. I have no doubt that my noble Friend the Under-Secretary will wish to consider any requests put to him for meetings to be held with the Glasgow authorities on certain aspects of the Bill.<br><br>
I have noted the concern expressed by hon. Members about the position in future of comprehensive development areas. I assure my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Bridgeton and my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Hugh D. Brown) that we believe that this new way of doing things will help the City. I assure all hon. Members who represent Glasgow constituencies that this new method will make it easier for the city to get on with the Herculean task of theoretically recreating a new city out of its slumdom and bad inheritance, which for so many years has scarred Glasgow but which has not damaged the people's good nature.<br><br>
I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Motherwell (Mr. Lawson)
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
for his speech in support of this proposal. His remarks were characteristic of him and I appreciate his criticism of the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger).<br><br>
I was not sure which horse the hon. Member was riding this morning. While he is an excellent circus performer, I thought that he was not merely riding two horses at once but that he was managing to stay on them while they were going in opposite directions. He first said that the Bill was ten years too early. Then he urged us to push ahead at all speed with what we are attempting to do.<br><br>
I do not agree that the Bill is ten years too early, nor do I agree with my right hon. Friend the Member for East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn) that it is fifty years too late. Certainly it could have been introduced earlier. Perhaps the Planning Advisory Group should have been set up during the years of which the locusts were eating; in 1963 when the last Conservative Government were breathing their final gasp.<br><br>
Several hon. Members questioned me about the 1947 Act. Under that Measure development plans for the 57 planning authorities were to be submitted as soon as possible to the Secretary of State, and every five years thereafter they were to be revised. Not one local authority observed that completely and submitted a development plan. Neither, therefore, did they make a quinquennial review every five years. For this reason that provision has been deleted. As my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Doig) said, we are substituting a system of the constant survey of areas, rather than having a definitive statement about time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the Minister agree that there are certain local authorities in Scotland which have not required a quinquennial review because they have progressively, year by year, proceeded with amendments to development plans? Is it not a fact that, while they may have been falling behind in this respect, they have been progressively amending these plans so as to make a quinquennial review unnecessary? I can think of several authorities in this position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not an unfair point to make, but it depends to which local authorities one is referring. The
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0832">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
concept originally was that the plans should not be implemented in a piecemeal fashion. We should not forget that some authorities in Scotland are small. The noble Lord the Member for Edinburgh, North (Earl of Dalkeith) referred to the Borders. If ever an area was desperately in need of reform, that is it.<br><br>
I put a simple request to the Border counties recently. I asked them to enlarge their joint planning advisory committee beyond the present three counties. I am sure that the three counties would willingly have agreed to such an enlargement, but the other counties would not join them. Certainly the Borders should not be so fractionalised. Fewer authorities are necessary.<br><br>
I assure my hon. Friend the Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel) that the important difference about counties in this context is that while the counties cover large areas, large holes are punctured in them, so to speak, by large burghs. The burghs, of course, have shown themselves singularly determined to resist any proposal that they should join with counties for this purpose or for any other. The hon. Member for Ayr is a classic example.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Younger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why me?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: His loyalty to Ayr often transcends his loyalty to Ayrshire. We recall his arguments over, for example, police and water. I do not blame him, since he no doubt receives more votes from Ayr burgh than from the county. He should be the last person to argue against counties joining.<br><br>
Under the 1947 Act we had 57 planning authorities. We still have them. Under the Social Work Act it was intended to reduce that number, but I regret to say that the number of unions has been small. At least we have managed to persuade Port Glasgow and Greenock to combine under that Measure. It will not be possible to recruit sufficient people with the right talent to operate the Social Work Act and to deal with matters like water and planning generally unless there are more unions of this sort. We are short of planners, but we would not be that short of them if we had fewer authorities which could look at matters on a broader scale. We would thereby
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
get over part of the shortage, and it should not be forgotten that we are doing our best in universities and elsewhere to train planners for this important job.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dempsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend should not forget that some local authorities have not even completed their first review under the 1947 Act and have been unable to conduct quinquennial reviews because of the shortage of planners and other staff. I am referring particularly to large authorities. This being so, even under this Measure how does he expect authorities, which could be equally large or larger, to have sufficient staff to do this work when there appears to be a natural shortage?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In a number of ways, Lanarkshire is an excellent example of how the problem can be solved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dempsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Lanarkshire has not yet completed a plan.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised to hear my hon. Friend say that, in view of his natural concern for Lanarkshire, which is one part of the country where six planning authorities came together. I agree that it took us a long time to get them to join—two years of hard work; but at elected member level, and not at official level, we got them to join to provide a structure plan. That is an example of large industrial burghs and a very large industrial county getting together.<br><br>
We have done the same in Ayrshire, which is a less difficult county in terms of bringing in all the small burghs which are not planning authorities. This shows that it can be done, and by using the present staffs. On 20th June we will be having what I hope will be the last meeting of the working party in Ayrshire to settle what we call the "Kilmarnock corridor". We have finished the land use study in Ayrshire and we completed the Lanarkshire study in January. The Renfrewshire study has also been completed. These are essential pieces of work which will be valid in terms of any tasks which the Clyde Valley Advisory Committee may undertake.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dempsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt my hon. Friend but it is my duty to insist that my hon. Friend appears to have been misguided. Is my hon. Friend
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0833">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
aware that a meeting of planners and local councillors to consider the redevelopment of my home town, which is only one small part of Lanarkshire, took place in June, 1959, and that a plan for that project has not yet been completed?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Although I cannot confirm, off the cuff, what my hon. Friend has said, I accept his remarks. There may be a town or district map in Lanarkshire's plan which has not been completed, but Lanarkshire did an excellent job in, for example, its new town, as it was called. Larkhall-Stonehouse was an excellent example of a new town which was not of the conventional size but was one catering for more than 120,000 people. That was done by Lanarkshire's previous planning officer, I agree with the assistance of the Department. It showed what could be done. We can, by the recruitment of planners and by making planning an attractive profession, as we are doing, make good the shortage of staff and use our present resources in a better way. The answer, of course, is more co-operation.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie), in referring to subsection (4), said that these consultations were concerned more with matters at the perimeter. While that is true, it is not the whole of the story. The authorities work together in a wider content; for example, in Falkirk and Grangemouth. This work has been extremely relevant to the activities of the study group in the area. On 13th June I meet the planning advisory committee for the area, including representatives of the County of Stirling, and Falkirk and some of the smaller burghs. Representatives of West Lothian will also be there. I mention these dates specifically when I am asked for a timetable. We know that the Bill will be finished in Committee, and will be on its way to the Statute Book if not finished altogether in that month. Certain local authorities are very keen to see legislation introduced.<br><br>
11.45 a.m.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Member for Pentlands asked me two questions. The answer to both is, Yes. Yes, we intend to introduce the Clauses on different dates and different times in the nature of the provisions in Clause 102 to which he referred. Of course, it is true that in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
theory, and it may be also true in practice, though I doubt it, that one could have a date for Clause 1 and a date for Clause 2, but our own theory is at the moment that we would have a date for the whole of Part I for a specific area. It would be difficult to say what the area would be at the moment because to a large extent it depends on local willingness to combine.<br><br>
If the hon. and learned Gentleman looks again at Section 2 (2) of the 1947 Act he will see that it is quite open to two or more planning authorities, with the consent of the Secretary of State, to combine for any purposes of the Act. We do not just pick this up here to make it tidy. We do so because we can expect that, after Wheatley is published, and the debate starts on the reorganisation of local government, we shall have a genuine and spontaneous response from those authorities concerned to come together more and more and make the advice relevant—I do not mean the combining of everybody, but to make it relevant to what they are doing.<br><br>
We can, of course, get a joint planning advisory committee, but the idea is to try to get encouragement along these lines. But I wonder how many Members of Parliament will willingly urge their authorities to come together, or even to have a combination of planning authorities, before the recommendations of the Royal Commission are translated into Statute? That they will be translated into Statute, I have no doubt. If we are the Government, as looks very likely, in the next Parliament, then we will introduce a reforming Statute very quickly. If the figure of ten years is right, ten years would be a very long time for Scotland to wait. It would be a time of frustration in many important places, and that we would not want.<br><br>
I ask the Committee to recognise that the Clause is constructive, taking subsection (3) with all its very important provisions. For the first time, unlike the development plan, it actually itemises the economic and physical aspects of the district, the question of communications and all these other important economic items. In other words, it elevates planning and the structure plans into a much more important context than development plans have in the past. If the Committee
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0834">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 27</span>
can accept that this is an advance towards the economic development of Scotland, I have no doubt that we can accept Clause 1 with enthusiasm.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Could the Minister give an answer to the two specific questions which I asked him? One was, what proportion of local authorities in Scotland are at present failing to perform in accordance with the requirements of Clause 1. Secondly, has he been told what extra staff requirements there are, in Edinburgh Corporation, for instance, for carrying out the provisions of the Clause?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought I referred in my speech deliberately to the point that quantitatively this is too difficult to assess. One has to take in the qualitative point. On the second matter, without notice I cannot give that figure. It would have to be a figure based on an opinion by Edinburgh Corporation, not merely on analytical fact.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is still being rather vague on his timetable and I wonder if he could enlarge on it. The Minister may be right that the universities are trying to encourage students to go into architecture and town planning, but the staff to do a structure plan, in particular, and a survey plan, as well, must be experienced. They must be men of judgment who have worked in this field for some time. One just cannot come straight out of university and add a great deal constructively to the formation of the types of plan we are talking about.<br><br>
I wish the Minister would say whether he expects all local planning authorities as presently constituted to have complete survey plans within the next five years. The hon. Member for Coatbridge and Airdrie (Mr. Dempsey) has been impressing on the Committee how long it takes to get these plans to fruition. Does the Minister mean Scotland to have a complete set of survey plans for all local authorities within five years? Does he expect us to have structure plans for the whole of Scotland within five years? This is the sort of thing which planning authorities want to know. They have to begin budgeting not only in money but in time for the implementation of plans. When are they to start doing it?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Younger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Things do not really change very much in this Committee from one year to another or one month to another. The Minister was his own engaging self, as he always is on these occasions. The only small criticism that I would make of him is that he always appears to think that when anyone makes a speech he is making a blistering attack on him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, no.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Younger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister did not reply by making an attack on me, but he replied in the sort of tone which indicated that he was not taking what I had said as helpful.<br><br>
In fact the Minister has gone a long way towards what I said when he said it is his hope that after Wheatley's recommendations are known we really must encourage people to come together, and he hopes very much that thereafter the authorities, which by that time will strongly suspect that they are going to come together one with another, will make arrangements to pool their planning activities. I think that is really what the Minister meant and I am absolutely delighted that he said that.<br><br>
I would ask him whether that is really going far enough. I think he may well find that, when a stage is reached when every one knows where it is going to go in joining with other authorities, there will be a need for the Government to be much more positive and to say to these people, "Let us sit down together and the Scottish Office will help you to get a combined function going and to get a region operating a few years in advance of this final putting together, certainly in something such as planning".<br><br>
We cannot go through the next ten years with a planning machinery which is at the moment relevant to completely out of date areas. The hon. Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Doig) made the point that there will always be overlaps between areas. He is right, but one cannot take from that that one should leave every area as it is now. The whole object of areas of local government administration must be to minimise the crossing over between areas of supplies, services, populations, functions and so on. One may never eliminate them, but one can reduce them. If one redraws areas to large
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0835">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 29</span>
regions where most of the people gravitate, then though one has not eliminated the crossing over of boundaries one has greatly reduced it, and reduced all the attendant problems.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think the hon. Member ought to be fair to the Committee when he talks about the Government being more positive with local authorities. What does he envisage? What steps does he want the Government to take? Does he mean that the Government should force the sort of wider planning in the wider area he is talking about?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Younger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We shall never get anywhere in this Committee if we cannot discuss the broad problems of planning without bringing in the feeling that we are criticising some of the people presently working in this field. I absolutely reject the idea that in discussing this we are criticising any planning authorities for what they are doing now. We are not. We are merely trying to improve what they do in the future, and to give them a better framework within which to work. We will come back to this subject on subsequent Clauses in any case. All I am saying is that at the present time anyone who wishes to get a major development done in any part of Scotland has to deal with a local authority planning unit which may well be irrelevant, and frequently is irrelevant, to the effects of the development he is proposing to put through. I very much doubt if anyone in this Committee disagrees with that proposition and would argue that when Wheatley pomes out we should keep boundaries very much as they are now. I am arguing that we cannot wait for Wheatley to get the machinery for planning put right. We cannot do this because there are major decisions of far-reaching consequence which are going to take place in areas where we live and work, and we must produce an interim arrangement to bridge the gap till Wheatley becomes law. I think this is enormously important, and I hope the Minister will consider this a helpful suggestion which he and his staff will look into in the months ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am rather confused by the hon. Gentleman's attitude. In his first speech he said this was ten years too early. Now he is saying we must have ideas now and cannot wait for the Wheatley Report.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
I would like to ask the Minister to confirm that in the past there has been no question of people working with thin little boundaries. We had the Mears Plan for the whole of the Forth Valley and the Abercrombie Plan for the whole of the Clyde Valley. Is there any suggestion that these new planning authorities have got to start from scratch and ignore all that has been done by people who previously investigated many of these problems? Clearly, anybody taking a survey cannot afford to ignore the tremendous amount of work which has been done by these previous examinations.<br><br>
I should also like to ask whether it is being argued that all this must be done at the same time everywhere, and that everybody must wait till the slowest one comes up? Is not this a guide, an ideal that has to be worked for? We may not be able to accomplish all of it, we are not laying down the law that this must be done in a certain time; because, after all, previous Town and Country Planning Acts have broken down somewhere. I really think we are imagining a lot of difficulties and also imagining a lot of ideals which may not be realised for a long time.<br><br>
12 noon.<br><br>
I do not know why in drafting a Bill we should not put down the ideal and suggest guidelines for ten or even fifty years hence. It may take fifty years to realise, indeed some proposals may never be realised, but somebody must have an idea of where we are going. If we postpone this for ten years, as the hon. Gentleman opposite seems to suggest, and if by any mischance the Conservatives come back to power, they would be so busy undermining and undoing all the legislation which has been passed in the last five years that they would never have any time for any constructive legislation at all. It would all be destructive legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Younger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was not suggesting that we should postpone this legislation for ten years. I am suggesting that the effects of the legislation would be felt more quickly if we add constructive suggestions to it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that we shall save a good deal of time if we do not delay the passage of this Bill by unnecessary speeches and by prophecies of what might happen in the future.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 31</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised at what has been said by the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger). A few weeks ago we had a furious contribution in this Committee about the democratic rights of local authorities. He now wants to take them and knock their heads together and to tell them to get on with it. This schizophrenic approach by the hon. Gentleman is not worthy of a serious politician. I am surprised that he should spend hours in this Committee trying to tell us that we should treat local authorities in this way.<br><br>
There is a problem to be faced, and I am surprised that my hon. Friend the Member for Motherwell (Mr. Lawson) should come along with a most un-Marxist approach. He said that we should muddle along and should apply ourselves to the problems as they arise. I am surprised that one with his knowledge should adopt such an attitude. I do not agree with it. I believe that we can do something about our environment now without waiting for things to happen.<br><br>
With the large developments which are now taking place, the existing planning machinery through local authorities probably does not measure up to the size of the problem, but the Government have been trying to cope with the problem.<br><br>
We must recognise that we must have larger plans for different areas for different services. The Water Advisory Committee has been doing this for the whole of Scotland, and the Government's transportation studies, economic studies, Border development plans—a whole host of bodies—have been set up and organised precisely for this purpose. Millions of pounds must have been spent in drawing up overall plans into which local planning authorities can fit their own plans. This is being done, and there is now much closer co-operation between local authorities for specific projects, such as the development of the Clyde estuary.<br><br>
This shows an effort on the part of the Government to meet the problems which were mentioned by the hon. Member for Ayr. I am sorry to say that his own Government never displayed anything like this attitude in tackling the matter. The hon. Gentleman should be ashamed to lecture us after the deplorable record of his Government in this matter. We would not be so far behind had his
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
Government acted in the ways in which they should have acted. The hon. Gentleman's Government never accepted the idea of planning until the end of their term of office. It was not until two or three years before the 1964 election that the Conservatives became in favour of planning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Younger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has the right hon. Gentleman completely forgotten that the Conservative Government had a White Paper on local government reform ready to implement? It was the right hon. Gentleman's Government which shelved it and put back the whole thing by five years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This was a document which was drawn up in the Scottish Office.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What is wrong with the Scottish Office?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Once again the party opposite showed itself to be a most undemocratic party. It consulted nobody about the matter, but from the wilds of St. Andrew's House produced a document which had been there for years. It was an immature document, which had never been thought out and which was shown to be quite inappropriate once it was discussed. This is the great democratic party! It does not consult anybody at all. Born to rule: that is the party opposite! Never mind the helots. Never mind the people. Only when they are in Opposition and anxious to get the people's votes, do hon. Gentlemen opposite suddenly become concerned about the people, but they do not worry about them when they are governing.<br><br>
I believe that the Government are trying to meet this problem and a good job is being done in the right direction. I compliment the Government on the action which they have taken in this matter, and I congratulate them upon drawing up the terms of reference for the matters to be considered when the planning authorities have drawn up their structural plans. This is a good Clause which should receive the support of the Committee. I am sure that when we have passed this Clause, and later the Bill, the Government will carry on filling in the gaps which exist, without any prodding by the hon. Gentleman the Member for Ayr.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is one thing of which we cannot possibly accuse the right hon. Gentleman or the Government, and that is for the last few years showing the slightest concern for votes at the next General Election. This will become most obvious when the time comes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They are doing their job, even though it is unpopular.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If that is their job, then the sooner we get a change of Government the better.<br><br>
The Minister was correct when he said that the opening Clauses of the Bill bring planning to a new and higher level. This is recognised by the Committee and by my hon. Friends. The whole concept of the structure plan and the survey which precedes it is regional planning. We do not question the validity of the general proposition, but it is obvious that the whole approach of hon. Members on both sides of the Committee—except, perhaps, in the case of the hon. Gentleman the Member for Motherwell (Mr. Lawson), who falls back on the good old British maxim "Let's muddle through and sort things out as they arise"—has been to recognise, "This is the way ahead, this is what we want to do, but how are we going to do it?"<br><br>
One cannot ignore, as if it did not matter, the machinery by which this is to be implemented. The survey is the first step in this process, because it is on the basis of the survey that the all-important structure plan will be drawn up.<br><br>
In this Clause we are concerned with the survey. The Minister has said, and we are grateful to him for making it clear, that it is intended to introduce Clauses of this Bill at different dates and times. He indicated that the Government, as at present advised, intended a single date for Part I of the plan for specific areas.<br><br>
This is important because at the moment there are probably local planning authorities which are large enough and possess' sufficient experience and knowhow to cope with the responsibilities which are laid upon them in this Clause. One thinks, for example, of the counties of cities as obvious candiates for this responsibility. The hon. Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Doig) had reserva-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 34</span>
tions about this matter. He may be right but, having regard to the scale of planning experience and the responsibility of the cities, one would assume that they at least would be in a position to exercise these responsibilities.<br><br>
I appreciate that at this stage it is difficult for the Government to make any pronouncement, but with this legislation we are now moving into a new era of planning and we want to know what lies ahead. When the Minister talks of the application of Part I to specific areas does he have in mind the cities or other planning authorities? I think, for example, of one of the major large burghs, Paisley, which has the experience and capacity to deal with this kind of problem. Does he have in mind broadening the responsibilities of certain counties as well as the counties of cities?<br><br>
If this is the position and they are going to have the responsibilities of Part I put upon them, will Part I be operated shortly after the passing of the Act, or will it be delayed for a considerable period of time? One of the results of operating Part I right away, for the local planning authorities which have the expertise to cope with it, will be that for a number of years there will be two codes of planning in the country. There will be the new structure plan embodied in the opening provisions of the Bill for certain major planning authorities, and, presumably, the vast majority of the planning authorities in the country will continue to operate under the provisions of the 1947 Act. If that is to be the case, how long is this state of affairs expected to continue? On no view can it be said that it is satisfactory that two entirely different codes of planning will operate in the country at one and the same time.<br><br>
I have the impression that the stopgap measures which the Minister has in mind to cover the planning authorities which are too small to operate this provision are in the absence of amalgamation. We shall be dealing with amalgamation in discussing Clause 2, so I shall not touch upon that matter now. The Minister has fallen back on the Planning Advisory Committee. This Committee is a useful instrument, but it has behind it no sanction. If the Planning Advisory Commitee is going to be the stopgap till the new local government structure comes along,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0838">Image</span>

is the Minister satisfied that it will operate adequately? The Clyde Valley Planning Advisory group is to be reconstituted, which is a good move, but how do we know that the planning authorities within that jurisdiction will follow the recommendations which are suggested? These are the practical difficulties which we cannot ignore.<br><br>
Is Part I going to be implemented shortly after the passing of this legislation? If so, what types of authorities are going to be saddled with this major responsibility? Is it anticipated that there will be a substantial delay in invoking the provisions of Part I for the rest of the country, and how will it work when, as I have said, there are in operation, at one and the same time, two different codes of planning?</span></p>
<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged to the Committee for the supplementary comments, and particularly the closing speech of the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie). Before I comment on his point which is the central point in this debate let me acknowledge the point made by my right hon. Friend when he asks if we are to ignore all that has been done before. Of course not. We have learned a great deal from previous exercises and even Abercrombie has great relevance to what is being discussed now in the Clyde Valley Planning Committee.<br><br>
We have heard criticisms that some authorities have not come up to scratch with all the work required by the 1947 Act but some authorities have done more than is required by that Act. Some quinquennial reviews are based on survey material which is not required by that Statute. We know of that material, and that some planning officers who do their job extremely well feel they should take the new definition of the development plan and call it a structure plan. By acting on definitive points of assessment we do not think we are burdening all planning officers. Some already have this material and are anxious to work together.<br><br>
Nobody is suggesting that graduates from universities should come out from the planning schools and go straight to occupy senior positions in the planning
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 36</span>
set-up. Like anybody else in any profession, they will start, no doubt, with considerable advantage in planning, but in relatively junior posts and gradually build up to senior positions, but I should say that promotion prospects in planning are exceedingly good in Scotland, and I suggest that those in universities taking degrees now should look at planning as an excellent prospect for a career with challenge, imagination and constructive work. We have more planners coming from the universities and from colleges of higher education, and we need more to help in the reconstruction of our country.<br><br>
Dealing with the point made by the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) I cannot comment on the budgeting for five years. We would like to see—and I take the point made by the hon. and learned Member for Pentlands—the whole system being introduced as part of the statute reforming local government. In other words, this planning can be applied to local government as we reform it. I would hope it would be in five years' time. I do not think it could be much less, but if Wheatley were received unanimously, and everybody in the country were satisfied with it, including Government and Opposition, and there were no dissentient voice, it could be a shorter period than five years, but I think that five years is about right. The hon. Member for Ayr said he was misunderstood. He should not blame me. He said "ten years too early". Perhaps he did not mean it in that sense, but I agree that we cannot waste the intervening years.<br><br>
Let us come to the nub of the argument put by the hon. and learned Member for Pentlands in his last contribution. He says that there are authorities, the four counties of cities and perhaps Paisley, his native town which he champions with almost as much fervour as he champions the Pentlands Division of Edinburgh, which are the kind of authorities which are already of the size and experience to fit in with this Bill. However, I would point out that the great City of Glasgow cannot carry out its structure strategy without taking account of and knowing what goes on in neighbouring counties. It has to take into account the shape of the docks and the wharfages as affected by any further developments down the river.<br><br>

What my hon. Friend argued about Lanarkshire affecting Ayrshire is true of Glasgow, but we could introduce a structure plan system to the great cities and some larger burghs early on and certainly to the very large counties.<br><br>
But this raises great problems. The trouble with the counties—and Lanarkshire is an example—is that they have large burghs in them. This cannot be ignored by the counties and they have to be taken into account. We have heard the hon. Member for Ayr as Dr. Jekyll this morning and not as Mr. Hyde. This is not a blistering personal attack. It is just to try to illustrate the point that the hon. Member says we have to add something to the Bill.<br><br>
There are three levels at which we could operate before the reform of local government. The first is in the joint planning advisory committees. They are not easy to run. When we can get them together, the longer they do run, the more amicable they become and the more anxious to compromise, but it is the getting them there together which is difficult. The hon. and learned Member for Pentlands, makes the point that if one gets a majority, or the overwhelming weight of opinion, behind the advice the committee utters to its constituent planning authorities, it is not mandatory and has no backing. We escalate to the second point of action: encouraging voluntary combination. We need that within the present Bill and we need it in the existing Statute.<br><br>
The third point of action is that the Secretary of State should compulsorily combine authorities. It may be that a majority want to be combined but that there is an odd man out. Is the hon. Member for Ayr going to tell me that the courageous thing for the Government to do is to combine them compulsorily with that one objector? If he is saying that, it is a big step in policy which no Government, of either party, have willingly undertaken. There have in the past been mutterings occasionally about it, because some situations have become almost stupid as between one authority and another, but the action which the hon. Member advocates is something very new to the Conservative benches. I am not saying he is wrong, but this is something very new.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 38</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Younger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is that not exactly what was done over the police and water amalgamations? Compulsory Government action?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is perfectly fair, but we as the Government did the compelling, and the hon. Gentleman did the objecting, every time, and under his own legislation as well. I am not saying that he personally was the objector in all cases. In the case of the police amalgamations my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) and my hon. Friend the Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel) made it perfectly clear that they thought that Ayr Burgh had come out rather too well and had been treated rather too fairly, having behaved badly over the police amalgamations.<br><br>
What the hon. Member for Ayr is suggeting to us this morning, if the words "add more to the Bill" mean anything, is that, after trying hard to get people to work together and then coaxing them to amalgamate on a voluntary basis, he asks, "Will the Government have the guts to combine the authorities before Wheatley to get the job done"? That is what I think his question means, although he did not put it that way. I will willingly answer it if he puts it in those terms or when we discuss it on a later Clause. This is not just a matter facing him but a matter facing all of us.<br><br>
Paisley might be considered a candidate but also in Renfrewshire are Greenock, Port Glasgow and Gourock. We have already done this in Renfrewshire. We had this agreement with the planning authorities that the expansion of the different towns up to 1980 was agreed amicably after argument, that housing, schools and industry would all be settled up till 1980. We have already done the job and not waited on Wheatley.<br><br>
When we publish the report on the south-west, will it become clear that we should not just rely on the joint advisory committees? Even if that were proposed would it be enough to implement the south-west plan which, I hope, will be published in September? Will the hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) support this? It was difficult for the two hon. Members from there to speak on the water question with one voice, although that amalgamation has gone well, as our
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0840">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 39</span>
Chairman would endorse, although he has to remain silent at present.<br><br>
This applies in the north-east, in the case of the Gaskin Report. In my opinion there should be one economic group there, and there is a good case for saying that structure planning should be on a wider scale than is afforded by Aberdeen City, and perhaps wider than the city and the two counties.<br><br>
Look at the plan on Tayside. We expect it this year. It is not just the Central Belt which is affected but the Borders, Tayside, the south-west, and then there are the 92 local authorities in the Highlands, the seven crofting counties. The Government have shown their concern in that area by setting up the Highlands and Islands Development Board. I am not saying that we should have only one authority in the Highlands, but there should be fewer than 92, and fewer than nine planning authorities.<br><br>
It is not just a question for the Government but for all hon. Members whether between now and the reform of local government we can coax people through these three stages. Do we have to reach the final stage—of compulsion? I hope not, because it does not work as well as a voluntary or advisory basis. That is perhaps the answer to the question. If we get the co-operation from the authorities that we think we deserve, if we get the support of Members of Parliament in asking their constituents to look beyond their own boundaries, there will be no need for compulsion and no need to apply these provisions to combined authorities.<br><br>
We have every reason to think that Clause 1 is a sound foundation for the structure plans which will emerge from authorities which exist now or from those authorities which we may ask to work together on an advisory or voluntary basis.</span></p>
<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The discussion which has followed acceptance of the first Amendment has brought out that the system in Clause 1 for a review by each planning authority does not fit easily into the present system of planning authority areas in Scotland, and the Minister's reply cannot conceal this; it simply brings it out. He has discussed various methods
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 40</span>
of proceeding in the next few years by a system which will be more workable later when there are larger planning authorities.<br><br>
I would describe the situation a little differently from the way it has been described. I would say, not that the Bill is too early, but that, unfortunately, the reorganisation of local government in Scotland has regrettably been delayed. We wish that the reorganisation had got further ahead so that the two could have come in together. I think that both sides of the Committee agree on this, and although, on the one hand, it is pleasant to hear the robust voice of the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis), on the other hand, he did not very accurately describe the situation of the Conservative Government and their proposals in July, 1963, on the reorganisation of local government, although it gave him an opportunity to talk about undemocratic methods.<br><br>
He will recall that in July, 1963, a White Paper was put forward containing proposals for public discussion. Had the system of Green Papers existed at that time, it would have been a Green Paper. It was put forward to bring to the notice of the public the necessity for the reform of local government, and not just to leave the situation there but to put forward ideas for discussion. The Government then made it perfectly clear that they were not wedded to a two-tier system, which was put forward for discussion, but that they thought that this should be considered publicly to make progress with a reform which later all over Britain was recognised to be necessary. At that time we were two years ahead of England and Wales in putting forward suggestions for local government reform.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For the record, I would like to get this quite right, and it is very apposite to the Bill. The White Paper referred to by the hon. Gentleman conoerned functions and only functions. It did not concern structure, maps or boundaries. With respect, what excites most people in Scotland is, where one draws the boundaries of the different forms of function of local government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I entirely agree. This was the first stage. Any idea of putting forward a complete plan with all
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0841">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 41</span>
the boundaries drawn in right at the beginning would have called for the kind of comment made by the hon. Gentleman that there was no consultation. The purpose of the White Paper was to have full consultation on initial suggestions. The White Paper recognised that some larger anthorities were needed, and the suggestion was made that there should also be a second tier of authorities. The work that was done subsequently seemed to run into the sands, and later there was set up the Royal Commission on Local Government in Scotland.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman will remember that the Prime Minister, in answering Questions which I put to him on the Floor of the House, eventually said that there had been a major disagreement behind the scenes, an impasse had been reached, and that was why consideration of local government had had to be referred to a Royal Commission for Scotland at the same time as a Royal Commission was set up for England and Wales, where this previous work had not been done. No details were vouchsafed. I naturally did not press for details as to where the disagreement had occurred and who was arguing with whom; I did not think it would help. If a major disagreement occurred then, what I am worried about now is that this may just have postponed the dilemma. I hope that the same argument will not arise when the Royal Commission has reported. Whatever else may be recommended, we all assume that there will be recommendations involving fewer and larger authorities, and there may well arise the same arguments on similar issues. I hope we have not just postponed this, because it is nearly six years since the original initiative was taken.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think the Committee will have gathered, from my earlier intervention and from the hon. Gentleman's recitation of his most interesting point about the disagreement, that the disagreement was about the next stage, structure and boundaries. The other complaint, as is known perfectly well in local government circles, was that local authorities were not allowed to present evidence in support of one concept as against another, and this caused more irritation than any other matter. That is why the Royal Commission has openly and fairly collected evidence. Like the hon. Gentle-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 42</span>
man, I hope that this irritation, this claim of not being consulted, will not obscure the arguments which will follow, and that we will be able to get a decision quickly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to have this opportunity of clarifying the point, because I believe that both sides of the Committee regard this Bill as not being too soon, but rather regret that the reform of local government is not ready for it, and that, therefore, something must be done temporarily, over a period of five to eight years, as the Minister said at Second Reading, before the new system, whatever it may be, is introduced. That is the dilemma facing the Committee, and the Minister has brought out the difficulties of trying to cover this period. He raised various possibilities and dismissed most of them, pointing out the difficulties.<br><br>
I do not think the Minister told us what he proposed to do for the cities. He did not say whether the city planning authorities would go ahead immediately——</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With respect, I was asked a specific question about the four counties of cities and the Burgh of Paisley, among other things. I confirmed that these five would be suitable for the application of the structure plan.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid my hon. and learned Friend had not heard that. He thought the Minister had not replied.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister still has not answered the question has he? He said that these would be suitable for the operation of the structure plan. I want to know whether they will be given the responsibility under the legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps we should give the Minister time to digest that, since I have another question to put to him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I compliment the hon. Gentleman on his optimism that all these problems will disappear. Does he think that we will get rid of the problems by using the slogan, "Provosts of Scotland unite. You have nothing to lose but your chains"?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I certainly did not intend to suggest that all these problems would disappear in five to eight years. I was being optimistic about hoping that a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0842">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 43</span>
reorganisation of local government will have taken place within that period; that is to say, that the report of the Commission, which is expected in the early summer, would be considered, the consultations would take place, the legislation would be brought in, the legislation would go through and the Act would come into effect. As we know only too well, all this takes time. I was not suggesting that all the problems would be solved or that the final solution would be agreed by or would be acceptable to everybody. Local government must be reorganised, and this Bill, together with other Measures, makes it clear that this is necessary.<br><br>
To sum up, we are still worried about the capacity of all the local authorities as they now exist to be able to carry out the provisions of Clause 1, and I think the Minister has admitted this. It is unsatisfactory to leave in the air how, during these five to eight years, Clause 1 can be operated by all local authorities. We know that some of them will be able to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is clear from what my hon. Friend has said that certain authorities will be able to do something within the next five years. Clause 102 provides that different days may be appointed for different purposes and for different areas. I do not know how this will operate, but Clause 102(1), (2) and (3), make very enlightening reading, and I look forward to hearing about that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman was here at the beginning when my hon. and learned Friend pointed this out, but I will not go into it again. I am aware that this may happen, and the result will be a patchwork situation if things are started in some areas and not in others.<br><br>
My question is on subsection (5) which has not yet been dealt with. Will the Minister explain the situations in which part of a district only will be dealt with, rather than the whole of the district of a local planning authority, which is what is described in Clause 1(1)? The local authority is obliged to examine its district and to keep questions of development under review. Yet subsection (5) deals with only part of a district. I recognise
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 44</span>
that in Clause 2(7) there is, for structure plans also, an arrangement for dealing with only part of a district, but will the Minister explain why there is an arrangement for only part of a district to be dealt with in the case of surveys?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has rightly said that the Members of Parliament should bear some responsibility for encouraging schemes in their areas. If this is so, the Members of Parliament should be involved during the stage when the major plans are being drawn up. But this is not so. There is a very vague connection between the individual Member of Parliament and his economic planning consultative group: in the Borders one is asked; in south-west Scotland one is not. This may vary throughout the country. The position is the same with major plans. If, as the Minister says, there is a plan for south-west Scotland in the pipeline I hope that the three or four hon. Members concerned may be allowed to discuss it before it is published. As the hon. Member for Glasgow, Bridgeton (Mr. James Bennett) said, often it is a <i>fait accompli,</i> and we are not brought in in time. If the promotional efforts of Members of Parliament are to be used, the Members of Parliament must be brought in in the early stages and know what is in the plan before it is published.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister replies, I would like to be quite clear on this. He said earlier that it is intended to introduce Clauses at different dates and times, but there will be one date for the whole of Part I for specific areas. In his later speech he said that he would like to see the whole system introduced as part of the statute reforming local government. On the face of it, these two statements are no reconcilable. Is it his intention that Part I will be introduced for the major authorities before the scheme as a whole is introduced in the context of local government reform? Secondly, if that is so, when will he introduce Part I for those major authorities, and has he considered the consequences, to which I referred earlier, of having two distinct codes of town planning in operation at the same time?</span></p>
<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Munro) that it is important for hon. Members to be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0843">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 45</span>
associated with the work of the economic consultative groups. However, this is very much a matter for the groups themselves. When, as a Minister, I have been asked to give my opinion on this I have always said that hon. Members should be aware of, and where possible work with local authorities on, these matters when they are being discussed. For example, we recently had a meeting about the implementation of the second part of the Borders plan. I went out of my way to see that my hon. Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Mackintosh) and the hon. Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles (Mr. David Steel) were informed of the meeting in time. They both attended and made excellent contributions. I was glad of their presence, and nobody resented their being there. However, I cannot lay down the law about this. It very much depends on the relationship which an hon. Member has with his constituents. I would be very surprised if the hon. Member for Dumfries had trouble in getting an invitation to attend certain meetings—I am not referring to all meetings—of the South-West Group.<br><br>
As to the plan itself, when it is prepared it will be presented by officers of the Scottish Office, but this as the only plan for which we are doing all the work. Our consultants have been active, and I emphasise that this is the only one when this consideration will apply. In Dundee our chief planning officer and Professor Campbell of the University are the heads of the teams which are doing the physical planning side. In the Borders, on the other hand, a university team has been doing the work. The plan is presented for discussion. In the Borders it has been a long discussion—some might say, frustratingly long in part. On the other hand, in Greater Livingstone, Grangemouth and Falkirk the discussion has been shorter.<br><br>
It is at that sort of stage that hon. Members should be brought in to raise any issues they have in mind. I am making a lot of this because I feel that hon. Members should be concerned to take part in, and be aware of the discussions which are going on, particularly since the economic consultative groups are becoming more and more important in influencing Government policy and local
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 46</span>
government priorities. They are not just talking shops.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) is right about subsection (5) in that it is possible for there to be a structure plan for one area involving part of a district of another authority and that this might create certain problems. We accept that in respect of, for example, conurbations, which constitute geographical and economic entities and which comprise districts or parts of other local authorities, it might be advisable to secure the concurrent agreement of those other authorities about the structure plans in question. On Second Reading I referred to the problem of north Lanarkshire and Bishopbriggs, Stepps, Kirkintilloch, Lennoxtown, and the other areas which were involved in the plan there. It straddled three counties. That is a good example of where this provision could be useful. There are other places where it might be apposite. This emphasises the point made by the hon. and learned Gentleman about there being two systems. If we do anything—and we certainly intend to do something—about applying Part I to some parts of the country, there are bound to be two systems. This subsection will help us to resolve what will be a temporary difficulty. I would not say that the transitional period will be without difficulty because it is inevitable that problems will arise if something concrete is to be done in time.<br><br>
Time and again the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands has pressed me to say the when, who and how of this scheme. I cannot answer him precisely because a number of issues are raised. These are now being discussed and the authorities will determine the timing as well as the question of who and in what manner the Measure will be applied.<br><br>
The Bill is looked on seriously by a number of local authorities and some of them may wish to come in earlier than we feel would be prudent. Others, on the other hand, should, we believe, come in earlier. This is a problem for the Government, and we must solve it as sensibly and amicably as we can. I cannot confirm that we will bring in the cities and Paisley and other places at a certain time or the sequence in which that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0844">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 47</span>
will be done. As we go on with our various studies, the hon. and learned Gentleman can continue to press me to give more precise answers, till an Order is introduced, and I will do my best to assist him.<br><br>
I have pointed out that the meetings which are to take place in June will be important. I have one with what, I hope, will be the reconstituted Clyde Valley Planning Advisory Committee, and there is to be the final meeting of the Ayr Land Use Study Group. There will also be a study meeting concerning Falkirk and Grangemouth. This is particularly important, for it embraces West Lothian as well. Active meetings are going on on active issues, and I assure the Committee that we shall press ahead with these matters.<br><br>
I would not like hon. Members to think that they can corner me, in discussing the Clause, into saying what the exact list of places will be. To answer them I would need not to be a Minister but a prophet. I am willing to take on most things, but I hesitate at that.</span></p>

PREPARATION OF STRUCTURE PLANS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This may be an appropriate moment for me to tell hon. Members that when we come to the Question, That the Clause stand part of the Bill, I do not intend to allow anything like as wide a debate as has taken place on the Question that Clause 1 stand part of the Bill. I mention that for the benefit of hon. Members who may prepare speeches during the Recess.<br><br>
The next Amendment is No. 2, and I suggest that, with it, we take Amendment No. 9, in Clause 6, page 6, line 20, leave out 'be treated as forming' and insert 'form'.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 2, in page 4, line 2, leave out 'be treated as forming' and insert 'form'.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 48</span>
The effect of the Amendment would be to make the final words of subsection (6) read,
<br><blockquote><p>"any such diagrams, illustrations and descriptive matter shall form part of the plan"</p></blockquote>
instead of the present wording,
<br><blockquote><p>"any such diagrams, illustrations and descriptive matter shall be treated as forming part of the plan."</p></blockquote>
This is a probing Amendment to ascertain the effect of the words "be treated as forming". If the Amendment would result in the provision having the same meaning, it should be accepted. On the other hand, if there is a distinction betion between the two forms of words may we know what it is?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept the hon. and learned Gentleman's explanation of the Amendment, and he will agree that a parallel argument applies to Amendment No. 9.<br><br>
There is a difference to some extent in this matter in connection with the emphasis which is given to the written statement. Hon. Members who have studies the Report of the Planning Advisory Group will know that there is an important distinction between a structure plan and a development plan. Among many distinctions, an essential one is that the character of a structure plan is described in a statement of policy and proposals. It is essentially a written statement which must pay attention to all the items in Clause 1(3) and must justify not only the points therein mentioned but others, too. I emphasise that it must be a written statement. With the written statement there must be maps and other matters relevant to the plan to guard against the danger of undue concern with issues of precise detail at the structure plan stage.<br><br>
I agree that the Amendment would make no difference to the matter of publicity, representation and so on, but it is important that these maps and other materials should be treated as "forming part of" the plan rather than "being a part of" the plan. There is a difference. The hon. and learned Gentleman has a fine legal mind, and we know his reputation. He will accept that there is a significant difference in terms of emphasis. I therefore urge the Committee to retain the present wording of the subsection.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0845">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 49</span>
The same considerations apply to Amendment No. 9. A local plan consists of a map and written statement, and not just a written statement. There is not precisely the same need in terms of my argument about Amendment No. 2, but it would, nevertheless, be desirable to maintain a clear distinction between the map and other non-written material which would be useful or essential to illustrate the plan. This is a question of having diagrams, illustrations and descriptive matter which may be ancillary. It is important for this information to be supplied. In other words, attention should not be directed away from the central core of the local plan itself.<br><br>
Hon. Members who are earnest students of the Planning Advisory Group's Report will appreciate the soundness of my argument and the fact that it is based not only on the advice I have been given but on a great deal of personal thought on my part. I am certain that the present wording of the provision is better left alone.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that reply. The argument which he adduced about Clause 2 was based on the proposition that we are dealing with a written statement and that we should not confuse that with anything such as diagrams, maps or descriptive matter. When we examine Clause 6, however, we see that some of the edge is taken off his argument because it deals with a map and a written statement. The map is specified first. There seems to be a subtle distinction between the two approaches.<br><br>
However, if the Minister is satisfied with the present wording, and since this is a narrow distinction, I will not press the matter. Instead, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>It being One o'clock,</i> The CHAIRMAN <i>adjourned the Committee without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.</i></p>
