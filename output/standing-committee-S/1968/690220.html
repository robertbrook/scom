	<p>10.32 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Good morning, on this inclement morning, and congratulations and thanks for being here on time, and, in fact, for being here at all. I should include the Chairman in those sentiments, of course. We finished Amendment No. 7 after long discussion, and the next Amendment is——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. May I thank you, too, Mr. Jennings, for having managed to arrive to join us this morning. I now beg to move:
	<br><blockquote><p>That during the further proceedings on the Education (Scotland) Bill the Committee do meet on Tuesday, 25th February, Wednesday, 26th February, and Thursday, 27th February at half-past Ten o'clock, and thereafter on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. May I just interpose to say that it is usual for the hon. Member in charge of a Bill to move a Sittings Motion. But it is perfectly in order for a member of the Opposition to do so and, therefore, I am allowing this Motion to be proposed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very much obliged to you, Mr. Jennings, for your Ruling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I should explain to the Committee that this Motion is intended to be helpful to hon. Members on both sides of the Committee. I should explain that, if the Government accept the Motion, as I trust they will, it will not involve any loss of debating time on this Bill. What we are proposing to do—and I shall be asking for permission to move immediately afterwards, That further consideration of the Bill be now
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>294</span>
adjourned—is to adjourn the Sitting this morning for a reason which I will explain in a moment, and to meet for an extra morning next week, which we suggest should be Wednesday morning. So there will be no loss of time whatsoever, for the Government and hon. Members, for consideration of this Bill. The reason for proposing that we should accept this Motion and then agree to adjourn is that the Government have so mismanaged the handling of the Parliament Bill, that the Committee on it adjourned at close on midnight last night, and is now again sitting downstairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This place is in a particular difficulty. There is, of course, the general difficulty that many of us wish to take part in the debates on an important constitutional Measure of that kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The particular difficulty, however, is that the Committee downstairs is approaching a Scottish Amendment which has a profound constitutional importance. Indeed, I believe that Amendment, which stands in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger), myself and, I think, all of my hon. Friends who are present here this morning is, in terms of the Scottish peerage and the representation of Scottish peers in the House of Lords, the most important constitutional Amendment disussed in the House since 1707. It would clearly be wrong if we were denied the opportunity to take part in that debate. It would clearly be wrong if my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr were to suffer in any way by not being able to be present downstairs to move his Amendment, or, indeed, if, by virtue of being downstairs to move his Amendment, were to lose the opportunity of taking part in the debate here on this important Bill, to which he has already made so many distinguished contributions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is, I submit, the right and duty of my hon. Friend to take part in the debate downstairs, and also to take part in the debate here, but we cannot be in two places at once.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We raised this question at the beginning of the Committee stage of the Parliament Bill at 10 o'clock this morning, and the Chairman, Mr. Irving, listened most understandingly to the difficulties which we explained. At one moment the Leader of the House intervened to say
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0611">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>295</span>
that he would certainly consider suspending the Committee downstairs when the Scottish Amendment was reached, in order to give us the opportunity at least of debating that Amendment on the next occasion when the Committee on that Bill assembled. However, we were put in a particular difficulty because the Leader of the House did not, in fact, give a firm undertaking that this would happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the Leader of the House said was that he would consider this, and the Chairman, quite rightly, if I may say so, explained to us that this was a matter between us and the Leader of the House. Therefore, as soon as the points of order were concluded, we wanted to approach the Leader of the House to discuss this proposal further, but I was surprised to see the Leader of the House darting out of the Chamber like a scalded cat, hotly pursued by some of my hon. Friends, They have been unable to find him. The Leader of the House has gone to ground, and, therefore, we do not know what sort of consideration is going to be given to the possibility that the Committee downstairs will adjourn when the Scottish Amendment is reached.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not propose to elaborate this because we do not want to waste time, and I know that the Minister, if he is good enough to indicate his acceptance of this Motion, will allow me, with your permission, Mr. Jennings, to move the next Motion purely formally so that we can break up this morning and take our part in the proceedings downstairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to remind the Committee that we had a similar difficulty, although a much less serious one, when the Report stage of the Transport Bill conflicted with the Committee sitting on the Social Work (Scotland) Bill. We then experienced the indignity which can be suffered by this Committee if Members are required, because of Divisions in first one place and then in the other, to run up and down stairs. All of us will remember the poignant moment when my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North (Earl of Dalkeith) was locked out, and the urgent beating on the door while the Division was being taken, because he was trying to fulfil his duty in both places simultaneously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>296</span>
I think I have explained the position sufficiently. I hope the Government will accept this Motion forthwith. We can then perhaps have a brief formal moving of the Adjournment, and then continue in the way proposed without in the end, any loss of time to the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Bruce Millan)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I could intervene right away. I understand from the information that I have been able to get in the last two or three minutes that the Leader of the House is willing to meet hon. Gentlemen opposite so far as the proceedings on the Bill in Committee of the Whole House downstairs are concerned. I say quite frankly to the Committee that I was not myself present in the House during the various points of order, and, therefore, I am not so fully apprised of the situation as I might be. I am not quite sure how one should proceed, Mr. Jennings, but if you will allow the Committee to suspend for, say, a quarter of an hour I will make further inquiries of the Leader of the House. I certainly would not like this Committee to be adjourned if, for example, the Scottish business were not likely to be reached this morning, or if my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House has given an assurance of some sort which would meet hon. Gentlemen opposite. Therefore, rather than take this Motion now, and perhaps lose today's Sitting unnecessarily, as it might turn out, if we can suspend the Sitting for a short time I shall find out from the Leader of the House and we can then resume. I shall be as helpful as I can, and I hope that will suit hon. Gentlemen opposite.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very grateful indeed to the hon. Gentleman for taking such an understanding view of our difficulty. I appreciate that for very good reasons he was not in the Committee downstairs, and, therefore, did not hear what the Leader of the House said. The difficulty is that the Leader of the House said he would consider adjourning the Committee downstairs if the Scottish Amendment were to be reached, but we would like a firm assurance that the Sitting downstairs will definitely be suspended. That still leaves a certain difficulty, in that we should like to be present

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>297</span>
for the other parts of the debates, but I will not press that point now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the best way out now is for this proposal to be withdrawn formally, and then I shall suspend the Sitting till 10 minutes past Eleven o'clock when I shall resume the Chair again. If the hon. Member will withdraw formally?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very grateful to you, Mr. Jennings, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Motion, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Sitting suspended till ten minutes past Eleven o'clock.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the short time the Sitting was suspended I have been able to make some inquiries about the position in the House and I am now able to give the Opposition the assurance that they wanted, namely, that if the Amendment in which they are principally interested, the Scottish Amendment, No. 156, is reached this morning in the House the Leader of the House will see that a Motion to report progress is moved—[HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."]—and there will be no discussion on the Scottish Amendment in the House this morning while we are sitting here upstairs. In these circumstances I think we can proceed with our business in the normal way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friends and I are most grateful to the Minister for the understanding way in which he has handled this problem. I am also grateful to the Leader of the House for confirming that the Sitting will be suspended if that important Scottish Amendment is reached. There is still the difficulty that the Sitting of this Committee clashes with important business in the House, and that illustrates the difficulties we face in this Committee when the present procedure of morning Sittings of the House is followed, but I would like to thank the Minister for the way he has handled this problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had the pleasure of raising this question in the House and I would like to convey our
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>298</span>
thanks to the Leader of the House for his understanding handling of the position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you. The way is now clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. Last year, when roughly the same circumstances arose on 28th May, the then Chairman of this Committee agreed that if there were a Division in the Standing Committee the doors might be kept open for five minutes in order that Members downstairs in the Chamber could be notified that there was a Division here. I am wondering whether that procedure agreed to then will hold again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members can rest assured that I will take all the circumstances into account. The time the doors are left open is entirely at my discretion. I will see as far as is humanly possible that no hon. Member is robbed of the privilege of voting in this Committee. If a Division takes place in the Chamber downstairs I will suspend this Committee to give time and opportunity for Members to register their votes in such Division.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, the way is now clear. I call Amendment No. 13.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. I should be very grateful for your guidance Mr. Jennings, to help us out of a difficulty which we confront following the Division which took place on Tuesday. We had a very long and wide-ranging debate on the local authority fee-paying schools question. I am not trying to abuse your generosity by referring to that now, but three very important questions, among others, were raised during the debate and the Minister was not able to give a reply to any of them. First there was the point about the contract betwen Notre Dame school and Glasgow Education Authority; second, the provision of scholarship places in fee-paying schools in Edinburgh, and third, the allegation, totally unfounded, that the secondary departments of fee-paying schools pre-empt places for their own primary pupils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Small</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am listening to a point of order. We cannot have a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0613">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>299</span>
point of order upon a point of order. Will the hon. Member come to the point of order, please?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is all I wish to say to direct you to the three points, Mr. Jennings. I am suggesting that it may be for the convenience of the Committee if the Minister could make a personal statement now. These are questions that must be answered. Alternatively, perhaps you would allow us to return to this matter in the debate on the Question, That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have listened very carefully and patently. There was a preamble to what I thought was a point of order, but it is hardly a specific point of order: it borders on the grey rather than being black or white. However, I do not think I could ask the Minister to make a statement at this stage because, firstly, there could be no discussion on such a statement, and, secondly, I think the hon. Member would be wise to leave it to the Question, That the Clause stand part of the Bill, when hon. Members can make their contributions—within the rules of order, remembering that we have had a long discussion and that one would not want repetition—not even tedious repetition. Therefore I think it would be best if we were to leave that matter to the Question, That the Clause stand part of the Bill and let the Chairman judge accordingly. I call Amendment 13.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged, Mr. Jennings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 13, in page 2, line 22, leave out '(and shall be deemed always to have had)'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is by way of a probing Amendment to discover why the Minister has put in these words. Why, indeed, is this retrospective wording in this Clause? Have local authorities in the past been charging fees when they should not? Why is it necessary to refer to this matter?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further, it seems a little incongruous, when the Minister, rightly, is giving powers for local authorities to make up their own minds on what fees they charge in relation to recreative activities of physical education and training, that they
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>300</span>
are not to be allowed to make up their minds with regard to school education. It seems to be an illogical situation. Perhaps the Minister could elaborate on these powers in this Clause, and what fees he has in mind. I accept that local education authorities must charge fees to clubs for hiring out their grounds and sporting facilities. That is right and natural, but why should local authorities be empowered to charge fees to schoolchildren for using these facilities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the Clause does is to make explicit the power of local education authorities to charge fees for voluntary further education as distinct from compulsory further education, which at one time was envisaged through the junior colleges and in the case of facilities provided for social, recreative and cultural activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason why we need the words which would be deleted by this Amendment is that in the 1962 Act there is no explicit provision for the charging of fees for voluntary further education or for social, recreative or cultural activities. On the other hand there is no explicit prohibition, and the implication of the 1962 Act was that since the charging of fees for those activities was not explicitly barred then authorities had power to charge fees, and, as we know, authorities are making charges at the moment. We thought it right when redrafting these Sections to make this power explicit, since we are bringing the Act up to date and trying to improve the wording of the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having made the power explicit I think that if we did not have these words, and were not deemed always to have had them, there would be, by implication, some doubt thrown on the activities of the authorities who in the past have been making these charges without the explicit power. It is for that reason and to meet the facts of the situation that these words are included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore I hope hon. Gentlemen will accept that to remove these words would cast doubt on what is happening all over Scotland at the present time with regard to the charging of these fees. The Clause as it stands makes no change in the actual position with regard to the charging of fees in further education and the provision of these facilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>301</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for what he has said. He has clarified the position. Could he say something about the children of parents who are poorly off? What machinery is there for them to be exempted from the paying of such fees? In particular, for instance, what happens when a child in such circumstances might be a very good footballer and as a member of his school team might be involved in travelling considerable distances to play matches against other schools? I understand that the usual procedure in such cases is for the costs of travel to be shared by the children and for it to be paid by the parents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am not quite sure that this has to do with this Amendment. These words are retrospective, whereas the hon. Member is dealing with the present, or possibly a future, position. I think it is outside the terms of the Amendment. If the Minister wanted to answer I would not object.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not at all wishing to delay the proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. Just seeking clarification.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was merely making an innocent inquiry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be glad if my hon. Friend would deal with one point concerned with the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"and shall be deemed always to have had"</p></blockquote>
the power to charge. Has it not been the practice for a very long time not to impose fees on young people who go directly from school to a further education centre and who have received a card of attainment from their school or from the local authority? On the presentation of that card at the point of enrolment they are admitted free and a record is made in the register to that effect. Is my recollection correct on that point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may ask a brief question? This power of retrospection which will allow education authorities to be deemed to have had the power to charge fees relates to activities outlined in new Section 3. As it deals primarily with school education, and I understand also further education, does this relate to such classes for young people of school
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>302</span>
age, or does it also cover for these kinds of recreational, social and cultural activities for young adults and, indeed, for adults?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mention this because there is growing concern in some parts of Scotland about the alarming deficits involved. Near my home we had a class on motor car maintenance for women which involves quite considerable expense. Therefore I should like to know whether this covers not only these social, cultural and recreative activities for people of school age but also those of young adults and adults.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, as the Minister is tidying up the law, he might perhaps at the same time take the opportunity of tidying up the practice, and perhaps give some kind of general guidance to local authorities as to the appropriate way of handling the financial position of such social, cultural and recreational classes, because I feel that the practice varies enormously from authority to authority. There is an immense burden——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have let this debate go on but I would direct the attention of the Committee to the first words of this Section,
	<br><blockquote><p>"School education and compulsory further education".</p></blockquote>
It looks as though we may be in danger of getting into wider fields both literally and practically.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was simply inquiring about this in view of the fact that it relates specifically to this part of the Clause, new Section 3. If this does in fact cover this point would the Minister give some kind of general guidance to local authorities as to the way in which they should handle the financial side of this matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the risk of incurring the wrath of my right hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think we might all agree on the latter point at least.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I make it clear that in fact this Clause, with the inclusion of those words, makes no practical difference to the position at the present time. We are simply making explicit a power which local
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0615">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>303</span>
authorities have exercised, and will continue to exercise. These words are only to make it clear that the power has always been there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the points which have been raised are, strictly speaking, not relevant to this Amendment. For example, schoolchildren travelling to play football on behalf of their school are not indulging in further education, nor are they associated with the social, recreative and cultural facilities which are, of course, outside school activities. Football is a school activity and therefore there is no charging of fees, and the point raised by the hon. Gentleman is not relevant to this Amendment nor to the new section which we are inserting in the Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to children being involved in further education, they would not, of course, be involved in further education as such, because further education is distinct from school education. However they may occasionally be involved—and indeed, one hopes will often be involved—in social, cultural and recreative activities provided by a community centre, which is the function of an education authority. In those circumstances they can be charged fees for membership of the community centre in the same way as an adult, but if there is any question of hardship that is a matter for the education authority. The Government do not insist that the education authorities charge fees, and certainly not on that kind of activity, on any scale which is laid down from the centre. Some community centres have free membership, others have membership fees, but that is not a matter for the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far as the more organised further education is concerned, whether it is vocational or non-vocational, the charging of fees is, again, a matter for the education authorities, and I am surprised that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) should suggest that the Government should step in and lay down rules from the centre as to what they should do. We have issued circulars about these matters from time to time and we have discussed them with the education authorities, but the ultimate and principal responsibility is theirs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I repeat that this is not called into question by this Amendment because the authorities have done this in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>304</span>
the past and they will continue to do so in the future. The important thing about these words is that we are not changing the present position but simply clarifying the law as it stands at the present time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation. I believe he takes the point that many of my hon. Friends feel that the playing of games is a very important part of school education and should have the support of the local education committee. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we start the debate may I repeat that I will deprecate quite strongly any repetition of previous debates. I will play it by ear and hear how we go on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Brewis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to raise only one or two short points. I would like to refer the Minister to Section 3A, "Duty of education authorities to provide child guidance service." There is a change here from the previous position, because I believe that under the 1962 Act it was discretionary and that an education authority could provide a child guidance service but did not have to do so. Now there is a duty laid on the authority to provide this service. Let me say at the outset that I believe this is welcomed, but I would like to know how many education authorities are at present providing their own such service, how many are sharing the provision of the service with other authorities, and what is the general position. We know that at present money is very tight. Is this something which will cost education authorities in Scotland quite a lot in providing extra trained social workers or not? Perhaps we could hear the Minister's views on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further small point arises in Section 3A(	<i>c</i>):
	<br><blockquote><p>"in suitable cases, the provision of special education for such children in child guidance clinics".</p></blockquote>
Is not this going too far in the case of many children? What is wanted for many of them is an occasional visit to a clinic for treatment rather than this suggestion that special education needs to be provided for such children. Would the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0616">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>305</span>
Minister consider substituting in that subsection some such words as "the provision of special education or treatment"? This is something which is being put forward by the E.I.S. psychological section. It is one of the small amendments they would like to see in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further point. At present there are inadequate facilities for deciding on the children who will need special treatment before they reach the age of 5 and come under the education authority. Could we have the views of the Minister in this? Would it be a question of the health authority making some assessment of the number of, for example, deaf children to come forward in the following year to be educated? Is this something to be dealt with by the health authority or the education authority? Have the Government directed their minds to this particular problem, accepting that perhaps there might suddenly be many handicapped children coming into the education system?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will be relieved to hear I have no intention of abusing its time. It is true, as you have indicated, Mr. Jennings, that many of us have spoken at some length on this Clause. It is, however, fair to say that on Report some of us would like to return to the contentious subject of the adequacy of recreational facilities, and, indeed, to the whole question of the relationship between local government and central Government there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must confess I feel this, particularly as it relates to cost control. I feel that the relationship is not wholly satisfactory. The issue is simple: if Parliament is to bring forward legislation of this kind, assuming certain responsibility on our part for what goes on, then we have to be careful about progress chasing and to see how far the ends we desire are going to become reality. My hon. Friend made an exceptionally able case on the contentious issue of fee-paying schools, but on this sector of the argument I for one am still far from happy. Hon. Members will know that I have put down a number of Questions on a particular case, and I shall be returning to it, not for its own sake but as a concrete issue and example of the kind of things we should put under a microscope.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Clark Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. As the Government are driving through this question of fee-paying against the wishes of my own constituents and the people of Edinburgh, I personally will vote against this Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have to apologise prematurely for I stand in terrible danger at the present moment of saying too much. I want to avoid that, and therefore I shall be as brief as is humanly possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When one reads this Clause one finds it strange that the Opposition should have created such a furore about it, because there is so much in it that now exists. It says regard will be had to the age, ability and aptitude of pupils. That has always been the case and it will still be the case. It will be even more so, because nowadays, while written examinations may have tended to disappear, and in some cases have disappeared, nevertheless we have to remember that a child goes to school at 5 years of age and is in the primary department for six years, coming to its next stage at 11-plus.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We have had all this. No points have arisen in the hon. Member's speech so far that have not been fully explored during eight hours of debate. I would ask the hon. Member to remember that; it is going to be difficult for all of us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I started by saying that. I have never regarded emphasis as being misplaced when one is addressing a meeting, and emphasis may mean a little repetition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ah. Emphasis, yes; and repetition, as long as it is not tedious. If it becomes tedious then the hon. Member could be asked to resume his seat. I am not threatening him, but merely saying what order is. I love to hear the hon. Member, but we must keep within the rules of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly do my best.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was saying that there still exists all the mechanism for finding out the aptitude and ability of pupils, and they are placed accordingly. But I agree that some misconception and lack of enlightenment has centred round the creation or introduction of this new idea of a comprehensive school. It is that,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0617">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>307</span>
perhaps, which has created all the trouble; because during the debate so far I have not heard from my own side or from the other side a clear definition of what is meant by the word "comprehensive".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would submit that before we leave this Clause we should try to clear up in our own minds, and for the benefit of those who will be following these proceedings, what we mean by "comprehensive". What happened in England in 1944 has been quoted here but what is happening in England now has not been quoted. What is happening in England now is of importance to us. Top level secondary schools are being partnered with certain schools adjacent to form, as far as one can see, one school. Are the age, aptitude and ability of the pupils at the primary school to decide which of the two schools the incoming pupils will attend? Because we have heard that statement made. A school where I was educated, a secondary school of high standing in Glasgow, is now to be grouped with another school near it. We are creating two schools for one purpose. Will the pupil who has a certain ability and aptitude go to one school while others are placed at the other school in the same area not providing the same level of education? That is happening now in the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may have escaped notice that there is an easy way out. We cannot put into any one existing secondary school all who will be coming forward to it. We have to remember that those who have come to the 11-plus stage—and do not shiver at the words—have all been under careful observation by competent people for six long years; and every one of them leaves school if not with allotted marks then with what is called a "profile". Whether or not they use that word in Scotland I do not know, but that profile goes with the child, so that the receiving school knows its aptitude and ability and places him or her accordingly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all want to see education assuming new patterns and new standards for the simple reason that we are living in an age when these things are demanded of education. We are living in the most wonderful age that the human has ever seen, but in an age when, at the top level,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>308</span>
we are obviously lacking the quality that we should have, and that is being shown to the world today. Therefore, we have to strive and grope for that quality among all the boys and girls in the United Kingdom, and not just among some of them, as we have been doing for too long. Genius is not a class privilege. Ability is not a class privilege. We must do our best to see that it is something for whose development our educational system provides.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to develop this aspect too far, but it is inherent in and comprehends everything that has been said during the past week or two in this Committee. If I am merely uttering a warning, I am doing it with the further warning that I shall seize whatever opportunities are offered to me to emphasise in detail what I have been saying this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alasdair Mackenzie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the provision for the teaching of the Gaelic language—[HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."]—because, due to the wide publicity given on radio and television, there is a great interest in it and a great many people are acquiring a working knowledge of it. This is particularly true of the musical side. The hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro), in referring to recreational activities, mentioned the regional variations. This matter is very important indeed to my part of the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brewis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Member leaving the question of the Gaelic language? If so, may I raise a point with him? He will notice the words in the Clause,
	<br><blockquote><p>"the teaching of Gaelic in Gaelic speaking areas".</p></blockquote>
I wonder whether that is too restrictive, and if there should be Gaelic taught in other areas, such as my own or Glasgow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacKenzie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The wider the provision the better. I know that in Glasgow and in most of the cities there are Gaelic classes, and they get help from the authorities. This is a very important point indeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, we have the game of shinty—[HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."]—a game which certainly requires great physical fitness. There is renewed interest in it, but because of the cost of the shinty clubs it is being discouraged a great deal. I should like to know whether
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0618">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>309</span>
provision will be made in schools for the purchase of shinty clubs as part of the equipment. Perhaps the Minister will tell us something about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference was made both by the hon. Member for Dumfries and by the hon. Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) to playing fields, and we are all very familiar with the low standard of playing fields throughout the country. A new school is being built in my part of the country at Tain, and it will be opened this summer. Two years ago, before the building of the school started, one of my constituents came up to me and said, "Don't you think the local authorities are putting the cart before the horse?" I asked, "In what way?" He said, "They are laying out the playing fields before building the school". They were. They laid out the playing fields two years ago, with the result that there are now excellent fields, and when the school is opened they will be in very much better shape. I mention that as a very important point indeed, and since that happened in the ancestral home of the Monro clan perhaps the hon. Member for Dumfries will have a look at it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion may I just say that I welcome the Clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to say a word or two on Section 3A in regard to the study of handicapped, backward and difficult children. There is a further Clause, Clause 11, which deals with this subject, and I am in real difficulty about whether to develop the other proposals now or later. I am really asking for your guidance, Mr. Jennings. However, at this stage perhaps I could reserve my position on Clause 11 in order to cut down my remarks now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In regard to the facilities for child guidance clinics, I should like to ask the Under-Secretary of State whether the intention is to provide facilities such as those mentioned in the excellent reports which the Department has recently issued. For example, there is the question of ascertaining which children have hearing defects, and the early ascertainment of signs of maladjusted children. Then there is the other report published by the School Health Service of the study group set up by the Secretary of State for Scotland in respect of handicapped children. This is a very large question,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>310</span>
and perhaps we can discuss it in detail on Clause 11. Perhaps the Under-Secretary of State could say a word about these problems which all of us feel should be dealt with, so that children can enter normal schools and not be segregated into special ones. Some of the teachers of handicapped children have been making representations to us, and the cooperation of parents is needed. Some of the parents are apprehensive about their children entering special schools and their pride is sometimes hurt. But if these clinics are going to minimise the problems in the future, then this provision is to be welcomed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for his brevity. He would have been quite in order in expanding on this Section, but I shall see that he gets a full opportunity to do so on Clause II.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I make one very brief point, and also apologise to the Minister in advance if I am not able to hear his reply, but I have to go to a service with the hon. Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell). I just want to raise a question on Section 3A with regard to child guidance clinics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are here putting an obligation on local authorities to provide these clinics, and I wonder whether the Minister can say if he has considered the effect of this proposal on local authorities who already make generous grants to voluntary organisations which provide these facilities. I am thinking in particular of one clinic which I visited not long ago in Glasgow, the Notre Dame Child Guidance Clinic, which does a magnificent job and gets a great deal of support from the local authority. For an extension which deals with adolescents it had a capital grant of £20,000 and a revenue grant of £4,000. In addition, the local authority provides for the salaries of two psychologists and a speech therapist. We know that these services are virtually local authority services, as the cases are referred by the schools and by family doctors. I wonder whether the Minister has thought out the implication of this provision, and can he give an assurance that, so far as he is aware, by putting a specific obligation on local authorities themselves to provide this service, it will be possible when part of this provision will be by means of facilities provided by voluntary organisations, for them to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0619">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>311</span>
get support of one kind or another from local authorities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I just touch on two points very briefly? The first one arises out of what was said by the hon. Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell), when he referred to cost control, which is really a most vital point. Everybody would accept that people tend to spend their own money rather more carefully than they spend other people's, and the more we have central Government intervention and dictatorial powers being used the less are the local authorities likely to feel that this is their money, that they are in charge of their own affairs, and the less likely are they to ensure that there is sufficient control over expenditure so that the money is used sensibly. Therefore, I regret what the Government are doing in this part of the Bill, which I believe will mean more expense for the taxpayer and ratepayer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am fairly certain that I made no blanket assertion about cost control and the Government machine. I am simply concerned with this aspect of the Scottish Education Department's work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the hon. Gentleman perhaps triggered off in my mind a slightly different line of approach from that he had in mind, but I am glad he did trigger it off because it is a point worth making.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point relates to the very last three lines of this Clause. I wonder whether the Minister can give us a little more clarification of the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"but this subsection shall cease to have effect on such date as the Secretary of State may appoint by an order made by statutory instrument."</p></blockquote>
Can he give us any kind of forecast of the Government's thinking on the time scale?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should explain that I am not intervening in order to make a sort of winding-up speech. I hope that any of my hon. Friends who may still wish to speak will have an opportunity of doing so. However, there are a number of points which I should like to put before the Minister speaks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I can touch on the smallest point first. Earlier in our proceedings
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>312</span>
Amendment 8 was grouped with a previous Amendment, and during the debate on that previous Amendment no reference was made to Amendment 8. Perhaps I can simply say to the Minister that the purpose of that Amendment was, quite clearly, to change the drafting in line 23 on page 2, so that there would be consistency throughout the Bill. I cannot believe that "charge fees" is the way to describe the making of a charge by a local authority for the facilities provided under this Section. "Make charges" appears to be a happier phrase, and, indeed, that is the form which appears elsewhere in the Bill. I do not want to press this point at all, but the Minister might bear it in mind for the Report stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find myself in the same difficulty as the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Hannan), because there is a great deal that one might say about the problems of handicapped children under new Section 3A. It may make for orderly debate if we postpone our observations till we come to a later Clause. I think there will be quite a lot of harmony between us on that occasion, and I hope we shall be able to improve the Bill substantially.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be grateful if the Minister, when he replies to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Galloway (Mr. Brewis) about the implications of this new Section 3A, could also answer one or two points of mine. The first significant word is the word "duty", and if one compares this new Section with the existing Section of the 1962 Act it appears that the Minister is, in effect, upgrading the responsibilities which will confront local authorities. What used to be lawful for them to do will now become a duty for them to pursue. I make no objection to that, provided that the local authorities are equipped to fulfil this duty properly. I do not want to spell it out now, but clearly, where one is dealing with handicapped children or children who are facing difficulties of various kinds, it is critical that the service should be effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that paragraphs (	<i>a</i>), (	<i>b</i>) and (	<i>c</i>) of the new Section 3A simply restate in a tabular form the existing provisions of the 1962 Act. Paragraph (	<i>d</i>) appears to be new.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0620">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>313</span>
It provides that the education authority shall give
	<br><blockquote><p>"advice to a local authority within the meaning of the Social Works (Scotland) Act 1968 regarding the assessment of the needs of any child for the purposes of any of the provisions of that or any other enactment."</p></blockquote>
I suppose that this simply provides a statutory bridge between the education department and the new social work department. Perhaps the Minister could tell us about any progress which has been made in setting up the new social work department, so that we may now know the extent to which this provision is likely to operate when the Bill is enacted. I was delighted to hear the hon. Gentleman the Member for Ross and Cromarty (Mr. Alasdair Mackenzie) refer to the teaching of Gaelic in Gaelic-speaking areas. It was nice to hear him resuming the mantle of reasonableness which he normally carries, and to which we are accustomed, in contradistinction to his attitude the other day. I feel that I ought to turn to him and say, "suas so". But I am sure that it would be out of order, so I will not say it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not understand it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reference in the Clause to the teaching of Gaelic in Gaelic-speaking areas is simply a repetition of the words in the 1962 Act, but there is a significant difference in the provision in this Bill. The 1962 Act, if I read it correctly, referred to the teaching of Gaelic in Gaelic-speaking areas in the context of primary education only. I should be grateful if the Minister would now confirm whether or not the teaching of Gaelic in Gaelic-speaking areas is being extended from the primary to the secondary school stage. It appears to me that the new requirement, which in effect is permissive is that Gaelic may be taught in Gaelic-speaking areas at both the primary and the secondary stage. This appears to be a new provision and I should be grateful if the Minister would comment upon this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not making this comment in any mood of opposition. I want to see Gaelic taught in Gaelic-speaking areas. I have a great affection for the language, and one of the sadnesses on the Scottish scene over the last years has been the way in which this ancient tongue has been declining.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>314</span>
Perhaps the Minister could help by telling us just what is a Gaelic-speaking area. There will be part of the hon. Gentleman's own constituency which is quite obviously Gaelic speaking because Gaelic is the tongue naturally spoken in those areas. There will be parts of Argyll and in other parts of Scotland which, on any commonsense view, one would regard as Gaelic-speaking areas. Alas, these are declining. I remember well that in Argyll when I was a boy there were Gaelic-speaking areas which are now, alas, English-speaking areas only, with nobody in the neighbourhood speaking this ancient tongue. I hope that the Minister will accept that the interpretation of what is or what is not a Gaelic-speaking area needs to be a large and generous one. It already is a generous one, and this generosity of interpretation must continue. I do not know the facts, but I would guess that there are as many, if not more, Gaelic-speaking people of Highland descent in Glasgow than there are in the Highlands themselves. Certainly Gaelic is taught in some primary schools in Glasgow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And in secondary schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And in secondary schools, too, as the hon. Gentleman reminds me. Gaelic is taught in these schools because of the particular and always to be praised continuing cultural interest which Glasgow Highlanders take in their ancient tongue. But the question is: is Glasgow a Gaelic-speaking area? I suggest that the point should be looked at carefully. I do not suppose that commonsense would declare that Glasgow is a Gaelic-speaking area. I suppose that some eager lawyer might be able to obtain a ruling that the permission provided in this Clause to teach Gaelic should not apply to Glasgow. The last thing I want to see is the teaching of Gaelic being excluded unreasonably in any way at all. Therefore would the Minister say if Glasgow is a Gaelic-speaking area for the purposes of the Clause and if so whether there should not be some more accurate definition of what Gaelic-speaking areas are. It may be that they could be covered in a Schedule at Report stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The part of the Clause which we totally oppose is the provision to remove the

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>315</span>
power of local authorities to charge fees in fee-paying schools. I do not think that it would be right—and I am sure you would not allow me to pursue this matter, Mr. Jennings—to go again over ground which has been covered so extensively during the debates on this Clause. I simply say that I regret the Government's proposal deeply, and my hon. Friends and I will do everything in our power to oppose it at every opportunity. I assure my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) that an opportunity will present itself again quite soon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You were good enough, Mr. Jennings, to say earlier that you would listen carefully if I referred to three questions which were unanswered the other day. I will do so as briefly as I can, without attempting to open up a wider debate.

I feel that we are in danger of reopening the whole subject again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member has been present all morning. He has heard everything I have said. He cannot interpret what I said as meaning that I gave any assurances. The words I used were that I would "play this by ear" when this Question, That the Clause stand part of the Bill was reached. I said that I would allow the hon. Member to raise the points, but he was warned, as was the whole Committee, that we could not have a regurgitation of the old arguments. I am prepared to listen to the hon. Member and hear how far he goes or does not go.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Gentleman that I am not trying to abuse the generosity of the Committee. I simply wish to make a passing reference to these three matters in the hope that the Minister will reply to them. I shall not quote from earlier discussions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman will recall that my hon. Friend raised the question of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>316</span>
written contract drawn up in 1940 between Notre Dame and the Corporation of Glasgow. This is clearly a matter of great legal importance, but in his reply the Minister was not able to give us any information. He said, in effect, that if there were any problem no doubt the local authority would let him know about it. That is not good enough. When the hon. Gentleman confronts a great difficulty of this kind, his reply is "Let the local authority sort it out". That is not a concession to local democracy, but is simply shuffling off a major problem from the Minister on to local authorities who are in no position to resolve it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point to which I wish briefly to refer is the question of the scholarship places, which amount to some 10 per cent. of the secondary rolls in some of the fee-paying schools, certainly in Edinburgh. The hon. Gentleman did not see fit to refer to this when talking about free places the other day, but I hope that he will now refer to the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third point that the hon. Gentleman made no attempt to answer was my comment on his allegation that the secondary departments of fee-paying schools in some way pre-empt the majority of their places in those secondary departments for pupils who have attended their own primary departments. That is quite false, and I hope that the Minister this morning will retract the statement or the implication implied in this statement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are a number of other points which could be made. I have tried to refer to what I regard as the major ones, reserving the whole range of the question of handicapped children to a later stage of debate on the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Esmond Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief indeed. I simply want to raise two issues which are matters of principle arising out of our eight and a half hours of debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first question I wish to put to the Minister is, whether he can now guide us as to the relationship in the matter of education between the central Government and the local authorities. I am left in complete ambiguity as to how much genuine freedom Glasgow Corporation, or for that matter any other authority, has in the matter of education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>317</span>
The Minister's speech on Tuesday indicated that two and a half years ago there had been a clash in his own discussions with Glasgow and Edinburgh. In my interpretation, this would be railroading this Measure through, but, when pressed, he said that it would be for the local authority to bring forward proposals as to the specific siting of schools or specific plans by Allen Glen's and Hillhead. This leaves all local authorities in some uncertainty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will not press the point about Notre Dame, which was admirably made by my hon. Friend, but it also brings into question the relationship between the local authority and the Hutcheson School Trusts and the many schools in Scotland which have some degree of history. I should like the Minister to try to define for us now and for the future how much genuine freedom there remains in local authorities in the matter of education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a second, more specific question on which I hope the Minister can help me. The hon. Gentleman the Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) made an admirable contribution this morning. He put some pertinent questions, and came closer to defining comprehensive education than we have so far in our discussions in this Committee. But there is a problem which the hon. Gentleman the Member for Govan raised of calling a comprehensive school a "scattered" school on two or three scattered school sites. I have given examples of this. I hope that the Minister will take the point about the relationship between the central and the local authority, and would he, in his planning, accept the fact that within the next few years comprehensive education, whatever our feelings about it, is going to produce a situation, so far as Allen Glen's and other schools are concerned, which leads to a physical separation of one part of a school from another? This would be a heresy of all that is meant by school education as the Act tries to define it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not going to go back over the debate which we have already had at considerable length, but I will make brief comments on the three points made by the hon. Gentleman the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur). I am not going to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>318</span>
say more about Notre Dame because I made clear the position at the last Sitting of the Committee. [HON. MEMBERS: "No."] Hon. Members opposite cannot have it both ways. If I were to stand up in Committee and say that Glasgow High School should be dealt with in a particular way, Notre Dame in some other particular way, and Allen Glen's in some other way, they would accuse the Government of making fundamental decisions about these particular schools, without agreement or consultation with the local education authority. I said the opposite, namely, that I first wanted to have proposals from them. That does not mean to say that I have no ideas as to what might happen to particular schools, but the initial responsibility is the authority's. I simply repeat that again this morning. This has been made perfectly clear to the two authorities concerned and neither Edinburgh or Glasgow has asked me to make specific proposals for their schools. They would be infuriated if I did that. Hon. Gentlemen opposite are asking me to take certain responsibilities which the authorities do not wish me to take. I have asked for their proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am listening with great interest to what the hon. Gentleman is saying. He cannot thus dodge the major issue that there are the Government's own proposals to abolish these schools. By making that proposal he is creating a breach of contract which exists between Notre Dame and Glasgow Corporation. It is upon that that he must comment. It is not good enough to say he will leave it to the local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to go into this debate again. There is nothing in this Clause which abolishes any school; it abolishes fee paying at particular schools. This view is an absurdity which is not shared by either of the education authorities concerned. I think in view of the conversation I have had with both these education authorities they would be very surprised at some of the assertions being made, ostensibly on their behalf, by hon. Gentlemen opposite.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Passing to the two other points, I am not going to deal at length with the pre-emption point. There are more fee-paying places at primary schools than at
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0623">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>319</span>
secondary schools and a large number of secondary places are taken up from fee-paying primary schools. I also made the point that if pupils were taken into primary schools with no guarantee of a place in a secondary school an injustice was done to them at the age of 12. If they are taken in automatically an injustice is done, on the merit argument, to other children who may be competing for these places. I think that stands regardless of what the hon. Gentleman said the other day.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I really must press on and deal with the new points which have been raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the point about scholarship places, it is true, as the hon. Gentleman said, that the figures I quoted originally did not include the scholarship places he mentioned in Edinburgh. I was aware that there were a certain number of bursaries, but the way in which I obtained the information from the authorities suggested that bursaries were included in the figures I quoted to the Committee, but I agree with the hon. Gentleman that they are additional, so the figure I quoted was not completely accurate. However, the addition of the bursaries does not make any substantial difference to the case I was making out so far as Edinburgh is concerned. In Glasgow there are virtually no bursaries, so the figures are not changed from those I gave to the Committee on a previous occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman complained that I did not answer his point, but he spoke after me on a previous Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I trust that there is no imputation against the Chair in allowing the mover of an Amendment to wind up. The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As well as hon. Members not being too sensitive the Chair also should not be too sensitive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>320</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member must not even hint at imputations, or lash out at the Chair when the imputation is taken. Nobody can suggest that in this Committee I have been either thin-skinned or intolerant, and I cannot allow the Minister to make these imputations. He should proceed with the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not making any imputations at all. I was simply stating which was a fact. The hon. Gentleman spoke after me in the previous debate and I was not therefore able to answer the points he raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is what I said. So far as the particular places are concerned, as I say, the figures do not make any substantial difference to the case I was making out. All they do is to increase the Edinburgh figures. The Glasgow figures are virtually unchanged. They increase the Edinburgh figures to 380 out of 5,950 so the position is substantially unchanged. Most of the bursary places are in the fifth and sixth years and are no help to pupils of poor parents, which the hon. Gentleman said they had in mind, at the age of entry to these schools. It is only when the pupils come through to S5 or S6 that the bulk of bursaries are paid, and they are not all by any means related to parental circumstances. Many are based strictly on merit regardless of parental circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not want to pursue this point, but I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman would confirm that the number of bursaries represents 10 per cent. of the secondary school register, certainly in the three schools I know of that provide them. It may be four. Secondly, would he confirm that a not insignificant number of pupils have these bursaries renewed annually right through their secondary course?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The 10 per cent. includes the total number holding bursaries all the way through the school. If the hon. Gentleman thinks it makes a substantial difference to the point I was making—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: —that 10 per cent. of children at these schools have bursaries, it seems he is not getting to grips with the basic argument about these particular schools. I wish to put it on record on
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0624">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>321</span>
this point that the hon. Gentleman was right in drawing attention to these bursaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far as the new points on the Bill are concerned, perhaps I could say something about the child guidance provision. As hon. Members have discerned, we are converting the power of an education authority into a duty. One or two hon. Members asked whether this would make a substantial difference to the position in Scotland and whether it would involve a good deal of additional expenditure. The answer to both points is, No. Every education authority, with the exception o[ILL] one very small authority, now provides a child guidance service. There are areas where one would like to see the child guidance service developed. It is developing at the present time. Some of the smaller authorities do not provide the service directly themselves but rely on the service of a larger, neighbouring authority. That need not be changed by anything in this Clause, nor need the rela tionship between an authority and a voluntary association—a point raised b[ILL] the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor)—be changed b[ILL] anything under this Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked about the question of assessment for special education. I think it would be for the convenience of the Committee that that should be dealt with at greater length on Clause 11. There is a relationship between what we are doing and the child guidance service. It is pot always a direct relationship in an particular case. Perhaps I could anticipate to this extent by saying that when we come to Clause 11 hon. Gentlemen will notice that in the assessment of the children we are including psychological as well as medical assessment, and go beyond medical grounds alone. When we come to that Clause the Committee will see that we are improving the situation, but it would be wrong to deal with th[ILL] at this time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not going to expatiate on the point pertaining to the social work field in regard to the new legislation except to say that social work departments are being established as from 17th November, 1969, and Section 3A(	<i>d</i>) provides the bridging between the child guidance clinics and the social work departments in the assessment of particular children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>322</span>
I was asked about one or two general points by my hon. Friend the Member for Govan (Mr. Rankin). I think perhaps these have been covered on previous Amendments and I need not answer them specifically, but I take note of his general point about the need to see that our school system ensures that every child is able to develop to the maximum of his ability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) raised points about recreational activities and he has warned me he will return to these on Report. I need not add to what I said on a previous occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far as the teaching of Gaelic is concerned, the situation has not changed as the hon. Gentleman the Member for Perth and East Perthshire thought. If he looks again at the 1962 Act he will see that the provision for the teaching of Gaelic in Gaelic-speaking areas was included not only in primary education but in the Sections dealing with secondary education and further education. The significance of the inclusion of this provision in Clause 1 of this Bill, the teaching of Gaelic in Gaelic-speaking areas, is that, because of the way in which the Bill is drafted, it comes within the duty of an education authority in these areas. There is nothing to prevent the teaching of Gaelic in any other kind of area, and it would be wrong to try to define a Gaelic-speaking area. One recognises it when one sees one. I do not think Glasgow is a Gaelic-speaking area. If one tried Gaelic on a bus conductress in Sauciehall Street I doubt whether she would understand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Pakistani, as my hon. Friend says.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are continuing a provision which is there already. There are a number of encouraging developments. There is one development in the teaching of Gaelic in primary schools in Inverness. I am speaking off the cuff and hope I am not mistaken in saying that every primary school in Inverness, except one, provides for the teaching of Gaelic. It is patchy from the point of view of anyone who wants to see the maintenance of Gaelic as a language.

There is nothing to prevent shinty from coming within the recreational activities. I know of one primary school where the children are playing shinty.

So far as playing fields are concerned, the hon. Gentleman's point about planning in advance for the provision of playing fields is a good one. The authority, in his case, has done particularly well, and one wants to encourage authorities in that way.

	<section>
	<div class='title'>PROVISION OF MUSEUMS BY EDUCATION AUTHORITIES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we let this Clause go by I should like to say a few words about the proposal in regard to the provision of museums and to ask the Minister to make some comments upon it. My reason is that, whereas I can quite easily see that in certain circumstances it is appropriate for an education authority to have the power to set up and maintain a museum, I really do not think—and this may or may not be the intention of the Clause—that the provision of museums generally should be a responsibility of education authorities as a general rule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not say this because I think education authorities would be incompetent to run them, or that they should never on any occasion run a museum, but I think the provision of museums should not be restricted by the idea that they are involved only in education. Indeed, if it were to be accepted as a general principle, rarely to be departed from, that education authorities were the right means of providing museums we might</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>324</span>
	<p>of Dalkeith) about the timing of subsection (3). On that I would refer him to what my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said in the Second Reading debate, namely, that the Order bringing the provision into effect would be done at the end of session 1969–70.</p>
	<p>I think I have covered all the new points which were raised this morning, and that we might now proceed to accept the Clause.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 12, Noes 8.</p>
	<p>well get a situation where our museums would be orientated too much towards the education of children and not enough towards the interest and involvement of the general public. In saying this I do not want to deny that of course all museums ought to be readily accessible to schoolchildren, regularly, easily, cheaply—in fact free—and on all occasions. This is a most important aspect of the provision of museums.</p>
	<p>Equally important, and with a view to the development of museums and putting more money into bringing them up to date, it is quite essential that the general public should be encouraged into museums at all times of their lives. If this is to be done I feel that the local authority itself and not only its education committee is the right medium for the management of museums. This is a matter of principle on which I would be glad to have the comments of the Minister.</p>
	<p>I believe everyone would agree that for various quite understandable reasons there has been far too little money, time and trouble spent on improving museums and making them more attractive to members of the public. If we are to get this greater public interest and involvement in the provision of museums it is necessary to widen the management of them, and I believe the management of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0626">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>325</span>
them would be narrowed if they were made the exclusive responsibility of the education authority.</p>
	<p>Further, I am not quite clear as to the reason for the qualification in the first line of the Clause, where it says
	<br><blockquote><p>"An educational authority (other than the town council of a burgh being a county of a city)".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>It reads to me as if this is merely recognising the fact that the big cities have departments which run their museums, and I approve of that, but what is the point of specifying that these should be exempt from the general provision that the education authority should run these museums?</p>
	<p>One other small point arises in subsection (2) (	<i>c</i>) where power is given to the said education authorities to allow museums to lend exhibits to other bodies on a temporary basis. I entirely approve of that, but would it also empower them, on suitable occasions, to hire exhibits to other authorities on payment of money? On many occasions exhibitions of a commercial nature might be anxious to have exhibits from our museums, and I feel that the local authorities involved ought to be empowered to lend them for hire and to make some money out of the use of those exhibits.</p>
	<p>I hope the Minister will be able to take these questions as serious ones on which it would be interesting to know the viewpoint of the Ministry. My object in raising this question is to bring to the attention of everyone the need to take a much greater interest in the provision of our museums and making them more attractive. Anything that can be done to further this should have the support of both sides of the committee.</p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened carefully to the speech of the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger). If the education authority is not going to run these museums, who is, pray? I think the hon. Gentleman should say that it should be given to the National Trust or
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>326</span>
to the Ministry of Public Building and Works, or specify some other body.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would have certain doubts as to whether any body other than the education authority would be suitable to run the kind of museum indicated in the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may just make one comment to simplfy this matter, I did suggest that this should be a function of the parent local authority itself rather than the education committee only.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not quite catch what the hon. Gentleman said. Did he refer to the planning committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Possibly we are slightly at cross-purposes. I would say that it should be the council as a whole or a sub-committee set up by the council for that purpose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am against the setting up of council committees, because this further increases bureaucracy. I am not in favour of committees of councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am very keen on this Clause. In the past, I believe, we have thought too much in terms of historic interest and historic sights. As the Member for Parliament for West Lothian I am concerned about what is loosely called "industrial archæology". I believe that in central Scotland we ought to be redeeming some of our Industrial Revolution heritage, as is being done by the Manchester College of Science and Technology. I am not in favour of retaining all the old works that we see dotted around the countryside, but some of the relics of the Industrial Revolution ought to be retained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then the question before us is, who is to do it? This concerns education more than any other sector, and is it not true, although we might wish it otherwise, that the hon. Member for Ayr is not quite right in supposing that it should be for adults rather than schoolchildren. Is not the truth of the situation that museums are being more and more used by schoolchildren rather than by adults? Therefore I would have thought this Clause appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would ask the Minister whether he has reflected on the problems of what we loosely call "industrial archaeology", and,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0627">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>327</span>
is this one added reason why the maintenance of sites should be given to the education authority rather than to any other authority?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a certain indirect interest. I cannot claim to live in one of these "objects", as they are described in this Clause, but I am a member of the United Kingdom National Commission for U.N.E.S.C.O. and we have looked at museums in less developed countries though I do not know whether that is relevant in this context
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to reinforce what has been said by the hon. Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) under three heads and to put to the Minister three points. I take it that this objective here is to stimulate visual training, since he put this whole subject under the rubric of education, just as, in an earlier discussion, we spoke of aptitude as if we could categorise people by reading or writing ability. But the great achievement in recent education has been the training of the visual senses in the appreciation of beauty in all kinds of ways.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe all three hon. Members who have spoken have been under a misconception and perhaps I could clear that up before we go too far on the wrong tack. Education authorities have no power to provide museums whereas town councils have under public Statute, and the counties of cities have under private legislation. The hon. Gentleman the Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) got it wrong in thinking that the position with regard to museums was to be confined to education authorities. In fact the position is completely different.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I put to the Minister three points. First, has he considered the problem of the administration of these museums? He knows enough of the history of some of them to know the position when there is a change of director and when a man whose main preoccupation has been with fine art is followed by someone interested in things other than paintings. That always raises a problem. To leave it to the education authority in this way leaves a great deal to the judgment of individual directors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>328</span>
Secondly, I would like to reinforce what was said by the hon. Member for West Lothian, not merely in terms of industrial archaeology, of which we have too much evidence in the Central Belt of Scotland, but stressing the educational value of business records and business archives. A great deal can be done if all material is brought into one single centre in all localities, on which students of all ages can work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My third point involves the question of costing. Today the effectiveness and educational value of museums depend on space and layout. I have seen something of this in other countries, and in some cases in underdeveloped countries museums have become community centres. Furthermore, if we are to attract people into museums we have to make them appealing. That can be done only by considerable expenditure which raises formidable problems. I would ask the Minister whether he has thought of those three points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I greatly welcome this Clause but have one or two questions to put to the Minister particularly regarding its drafting. First, I would ask whether the power to acquire objects is a compulsory power. It is not spelled out here how objects are to be acquired, whether by purchase or otherwise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I would ask my hon. Friend whether the exhortation to a local authority to take into account the need to secure that a museum plays a full part in the promotion of education has any legal effect or not. Like my hon. Friend the Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) I am reluctant to pass legislation in terms which do not appear to impart quite clearly either a duty or a discretion. Clearly, this is no more than discretionary, but as it stands it might be helpful if the Minister could say something on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further, it seems to me that under the Clause it is open to an enterprising education authority to go into the art business and acquire works of art for a commercial purpose with little regard to whether or not they are of artistic or educational merit. Discretion is, of course, used by directors of museums on many occasions. For example, the acquisition of the Salvador Dali painting by

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>329</span>
the Glasgow Art Gallery might be thought to be more a commercial than an artistic venture, but it is perhaps a matter of taste. None the less, we ought to be careful that in giving powers to local education authorities we are not inviting them to go into the art business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In my intervention I made clear the general point that we are adding to the powers of authorities here. We are not in any sense taking away powers of counties of cities, which explains the wording at the beginning of the Clause mentioned by the hon. Gentleman the Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger). Nor are we taking away any existing powers of town councils. It is rather odd that at present an education authority does not have power to provide a new museum and that we have no education authority providing a museum in Scotland at present. There is a rather complicated procedure, which I need not describe since it is never used, by which a county council can provide a museum for a landward area, but this is not a realistic provision at the present time. We have at present 37 museums run by town councils and one run by a district council. This includes, of course, museums in the four Cities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one has made any point this morning suggesting that he is in any way against the idea of education authorities having power to run museums. It is, of course, only a power. There is no duty on an education authority to run a museum, and I do not imagine there are large numbers just waiting for this Bill to go through so that they can establish museums. But certainly those who want to do so will be able to do so. Even more important in the short term, this will give an education authority power to assist a town council that is already running a museum, which is very important because some of the museums at present provided by town councils are very good and exemplary examples of local initiative, doing precisely what was mentioned by the hon. Member for Pollok (Mr. Wright), providing a lively place, a kind of community centre, whereas museums of the old type can sometimes be rather forbidding and dreary places, particularly for young people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Taking up the point of my hon. Friend the Member for West Lothian (Mr.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>330</span>
Dalyell) regarding the preservation of parts of local history including local industrial history and industrial archaeology, we have one or two very good examples in Scotland at the present time and obviously we want to encourage them in every way. Obviously, by giving education authorities as well as town councils this power we are increasing the scope for that kind of local initiative. I hope that that will be taken up by educational authorities and other local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Pollok mentioned business records and business archives. This is part of a very much wider but a very important part of the question of manuscripts and documents of all kinds, literary and artistic as well as business, social, political and economic. As he will know from his university experience, there are great difficulties in retaining these in this country and preventing them from going abroad wholesale, particularly to American universities. I would be out of order if I developed the point, but I can say that the Government at the present time are looking very carefully at this, particularly in the light of the recent report of the Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art. This is a very important question, but perhaps it is rather more related to national than to local collections, though it certainly has relevance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can only say that I take all these points as being very important and as far as the Government are able to encourage authorities to have due regard to them, we are certainly doing so at present and will continue to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The administration of museums is a matter for the local authority and it is not possible for us to give them instruction on it, but particular difficulties can arise. I must not quote examples, but I believe I know what the hon. Gentleman has in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Mr. Maclennan) spoke of the power to acquire. It is not intended, of course, that this should be power to acquire compulsorily. I believe the only restrictions we have at present relate to certain works of art, but they are hardly the kinds of things which would significantly affect local museums. They affect national collections of works
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0629">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>331</span>
of art and are an attempt to prevent works of art which we want to retain in this country from going abroad. Leaving that aside, the power to acquire here is not power to acquire compulsorily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of the power to make charges is an interesting point since it is a new one. Museums at present cannot make charges, but looking at the situation we have in 1969 I feel that in providing new powers, as distinct from looking at existing powers, we should give power to make charges in appropriate cases at the discretion of the education authority. In determining any such charges—and there is no reason why the authority should impose any charge at all if it does not wish—the authority must have regard to the promotion of education in its area and have particular regard to the interests of children and students. In other words, an authority must not impose charges in a way which would effectively exclude children and students from see the collections. [An HON.
