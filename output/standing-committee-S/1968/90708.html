	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i></p>
	<p>That the Chairman does now report to the House that the Committee have considered</p>
	<p>Class III, Vote 2, Scottish Home and Health Department, and</p>
	<p>Class VI, Vote 14, National Health Service, &c., Scotland.—[	<i>Mr. Ross.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Brewis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have several times recently debated the National Health Service on the Floor of the House. A few days ago we debated the future financing of the Service, and about a month or so before that there was a debate on the hospital building programme in Scotland. It would be tedious for me to repeat the points made in those debates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would compliment the Secretary of State on the Health and Welfare Services Report, both for its contents and for the way in which he has managed to publish it in time for this year's debate. The Report gives the figures for the cost of the National Health Service in Scotland. In 1967–68 the gross cost was £177 million, an increase of about 11 per cent. over the previous year, representing a rise in real terms of 61 per cent. compared with 10 years ago. These percentages are far higher than the rise in the Gross National Product; yet the shortage of staff, buildings and equipment is as acute as ever, and forms the central dilemma of the Health Service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nowhere is the shortage of funds more acute than in the hospital service. Last Friday, at the meeting in Aberdeen of the British Medical Association, Mr. Walpole Lewin, the Chairman of the B.M.A. Central Committee for Hospital Services, said that £500 million was needed immediately to prevent Britain's hospital service from crumbling. Scotland's share would be about £50 million, which is more than three times as much as we are now spending. Recently the building of the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>102</span>
Glasgow did crumble, and it had to be replaced at short notice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem of regional hospital boards in allocating priorities is obviously agonising. You, Mr. Robertson, are fortunate in Paisley in that a new general hospital is being built, but other areas such as South Ayrshire, the Borders, Dumfries and Motherwell have had to be put back in the queue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There must be great difficulties, too, in deciding whether the money is to go to support glamorous advances like in transplant surgery or to improve the very old accommodation for the mentally subnormal. I am glad that neither is being entirely neglected. There is a new transplant unit at the Western General in Edinburgh, although the finance for it came from the Nuffield Foundation, and the first new mental institution for thirty years has been built at Lynebank, Dunfermline.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Secretary of State be more specific about shortages of staff in the hospital service than he was in answer to a Parliamentary Question last week? It is satisfactory to know that the number of medical staff has increased, although there were slightly fewer doctors in the general practitioner service. The increase in nursing staff seems to be mostly in part-time staff, and in the less well-qualified enrolled and pupil nurses. The number of three-year trained registered nurses was less at 30th September, 1968, than in 1965; yet in those three years there were never less than 6,000 student nurses in training. So it seems that the wastage rate among nurses is alarming. We would like to be reassured that the staffing position in mental hospitals in Scotland is better than in England, as I believe to be the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to the reorganisation of the Health Service which the Secretary of State put forward last December in a Green Paper. As hon. Members know, the Health Service is organised on a tripartite basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, there are the hospital and specialist services grouped around 400 hospitals administered in a two-tier system by five regional hospital boards and 76 area management boards. The proportion of the finance of the National Health Service which goes to the hospital service is 62 per cent., and the majority of the medical practitioners are in this service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, there are the general practi-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0265">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>103</span>
tioner services, which include medical, dental, ophthalmic and pharmaceutical services, and they are run by 25 local executive committees. The finance for both hospital and general practitioner services comes overwhelmingly from Government funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, there is a wide range of local authority health services which are administered by 56 counties and large burghs in Scotland. The divisions between these services seem to some extent to be arbitrary. For example, maternity services come under the hospital service and are also provided by the local authorities, and the same applies to geriatric services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where there is overlapping there is probably also wastage of resources and some inefficiency, although it is a tribute to those who work in the services that the co-operation between the three parts is as good as it is. Each service tends to plan its future development without proper reference to the others. The family doctor increasingly needs the technical aids which are available only in the hospital service. Here I think the provision of more health centres might help. If they are attached to the local hospital they can bring together not only the family doctor service and the specialist staff but also the local services controlled by the medical officer of health. Clearly, advantages could be gained by a unified Health Service administration, provided that there is no domination of one branch over the others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How this object is to be secured is rather more difficult. The Green Paper suggests a single-tier administration of 10 to 15 area boards to replace the 162 various authorities I have already mentioned. This is a drastic reduction. If one glances through the Health and Welfare Services Report one is struck by the variety of services which it indexes. Each of the 10 or 15 area boards would inevitably become a considerable bureaucracy. I would think of necessity it would have to be split up into various divisions for administration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Green Paper states that if there were more than 15 boards their areas would be too small for proper planning, but if there were fewer than 10 they would be too remote from the point of view of the Health Service workers and also their patients. I am sure that the latter point is true, because the regional hospital boards at present are incredibly remote both to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>104</span>
doctors and to the public, although the management boards are better known. Local control helps to humanise the administration of the Health Service, and one must never forget the value of local voluntary effort. For example, I cannot imagine how the Health Service run from a central board in Aberdeen would be acceptable in the Orkneys or the Shetland Islands. I think, therefore, that remoteness of control would be a step backwards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is also true of the local authority services. When we were last year considering the Social Work Bill we decided that local welfare services should remain the function of the local authority. The health services and the welfare services are closely entwined. The Green Paper now suggests that local authority health services should be detached from the administration of the welfare services and placed under an area board. Presumably, their present controller, the medical officer of health, would become an official of the area board, which, in rural areas, might be as far as 70 miles away. This, too, seems to be a retrograde step when one remembers that local authorities need health advice on many questions which come under their aegis. I am thinking particularly of the work of the sanitary inspector, who deals with food hygiene, insanitary premises, rodent control, and so on. Such new divisions in responsibility in existing local authority services might leave the edges more ragged than those between the present divisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should make no firm decisions till the Wheatley Commission on Local Government Reorganisation has reported. It would be highly desirable if the new health boards were to coincide with the new local authority boundaries, but one can only speculate on what the Wheatley report will recommend. I would think it unlikely that it would recommend as many as 10 or 15 top-tier authorities for Scotland. If it recommended, say, only five top-tier authorities, it would be wise to keep the present two-tier administration of the health services, with the regional boards corresponding to the top tier and the local authority and management boards corresponding to the second tier. There would then still be a reduction in the number of management boards. This view in favour of a two-tier system of administration is supported by some remarks which were made by Mr. Farqu-harson-Lang, who is Chairman of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0266">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>105</span>
North-East Regional Hospital Board. He thinks that a one-tier system of area health boards would be unworkable, and that hospital service boundaries should be the same as local authority boundaries. This might mean regional health boards and local health committees, supposing that Wheatley recommends a two-tier system. The present views of the right hon. Gentleman the Secretary of State for Social Services seem rather similar, since his speech in Norwich a few months ago. Surely, where distances are comparatively greater, as they are in Scotland than in England, arguments about remote control are correspondingly more forceful when applied to Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to one or two separate points. There is considerable anxiety at present about abortions, and such anxiety centres mainly in London, but I do not think anyone can remain indifferent to the pathetic queues of miserable, frightened girls who are waiting in certain clinics. We obviously cannot stop the sex explosion, nor do we want to encourage promiscuity, but surely more extensive provision should be made for family planning. I understand that until the Secretary of State makes an implementation order the local authorities cannot use the powers to provide clinics and family planning advice which was given to him under the Health Service and Public Health Act, 1968. Why has there been delay in this matter?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My last point is on similar lines. Over the last few hundred years doctors have learnt to cure most diseases. In the last century a great deal has been done in the public health sphere to prevent the spread of infections. Now, surely, we should be doing much more to prevent self-induced ills. I refer particularly to alcoholism, lung cancer, venereal disease, and also drug addiction. Although the problem of drug addiction is comparatively small, anybody who gets hooked on heroin has a very small chance indeed of ever being rehabilitated, something like one chance in 10. Surely what we need is more health education than we are getting. During the last three years I have been a good deal on the Continent of Europe, and certainly we are lagging very much behind France in publicity on health education. Could we be told something today about the activities of the Scottish Health Education
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>106</span>
unit which was set up in April last year?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As this is the coming of age year of the Health Service, I am sure that all my colleagues would like me to congratulate all those who work in the Service and give such valuable and devoted work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. William Ross)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The speech of the hon. Member for Galloway (Mr. Brewis) has set off the debate in a very fine way. The tone and quality of his speech is exactly what I should like to see in the approach of hon. Members to this annual examination of the Health Service. I will cover some of the points he has mentioned and highlight them as I go along the point he raised last about health education will be dealt with by my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that the past year has been a notable one for the Health Service, The hon. Gentleman was right to highlight the proposals made in our Green Paper for the change in structure. Following the publication of these proposals last December, over 130 sets of comments have been submitted by interested organisations and individuals. There was a considerable amount of consultation before we published the Paper. Some of these comments have been outstandingly constructive and helpful. The overwhelming weight of opinion accepts that reorganisation of the structure of the Service is desirable, and that this should take the form of introducing, in place of the existing tripartite system, a unitary structure under which one authority in each area will be responsible for providing all the health services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of the organisations which take this view consider that the new authority should be an area board established 	<i>ad hoc</i> for the purpose; but the Association of County Councils in Scotland has expressed a very strong view that the whole of the Health Service should pass into the control of local government. By no means all local authorities share this view. Many would regard it as sufficient if a proportion of the members of area health boards were drawn from the members of local authorities within the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some other aspects of the composition of boards also give rise to differing views. For example, there is a division between those who want a single-tier structure with some 10, 15 or even 20 area boards reporting directly to the central depart-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0267">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>107</span>
ment and those, mainly in the hospital service, who believe that there would be advantage in having a few regional boards under each of which there would be a number of local or district boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am giving careful consideration to all these comments and taking careful note of what the hon. Gentleman said this morning in the light of the general acceptance of the principle of unification. Before reaching any conclusion, I shall want to take into account the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Local Government. The hon. Gentleman was right to emphasise that particular point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These will be of direct relevance, for even if we have 	<i>ad hoc</i> boards the boundaries for health purposes should march with the boundaries for social work and other related services as far as possible. The precise links between health and a number of major local government functions will be extremely important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equally important is our intention to continue to conduct the review of the structure of the health services in the same way as we have done hitherto, not by the issue of cut and dried solutions but by giving the widest possible scope for all concerned to express their views on the merits or defects of particular proposals. We do not make the naive assumption that we can please everyone, but neither shall we make the error of ignoring the wealth of experience and common sense to be found throughout the Health Service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman spoke about hospital building. I am the first to agree that we would all like to do more, but there are certain limitations. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State took the opportunity in an Adjournment Debate on 23rd May to make a progress report on hospital building. I shall, therefore, make only relatively brief reference to that subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, we should like to see more hospitals being built and there are many urgent tasks still to be done, but the statistics and the new buildings to be seen on the ground leave no doubt that we have greatly accelerated the pace of the programme. There is no doubt that we would have been further forward if we had started earlier. We are now in a period of sustained advance. Perhaps the Committee will forgive me if I quote
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>108</span>
the essential figures again. Between 1948 and 1962 we produced in Scotland an average of about 230 beds per year. From 1962 to 1965 the rate was 570 beds a year. Over the four years from the beginning of 1965 to 1968 the rate was almost 1,000 a year. In 1968 alone schemes providing 1,370 beds were completed—a rate of more than five times that achieved in the years from 1948 to 1962.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These new beds have already made possible considerable improvements in several important areas of the service, and there are further big developments in progress at an advanced stage of planning. Since 1965, for example, against a total of about 8,000 beds, almost 1,100 beds have been provided for geriatrics in new or substantially converted buildings. Schemes to provide a further 105 beds are now in progress, and about 700 beds will be provided in schemes now being planned. This shows the priority we have given to the geriatric service. Similarly high priority has been given to providing new mental hospital and mental deficiency beds. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the one at Lynebank, Dunfermline, which has recently been opened. We seek to improve conditions and to make available additional beds in areas of shortage in mental deficiency provision. We have provided over 1,300 new beds in these categories, and nearly 300 more are in schemes expected to complete shortly. On the maternity side, 516 beds are under construction, of which 400 are expected to be completed in the current financial year. This is a considerable story of expansion along carefully selected priority lines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In all, schemes in progress at present will provide about 2,750 beds. As the grosser deficiencies in long-stay accommodation begin to be overtaken, we are seeing a change of emphasis in the programme. About 1,870 of the beds now under construction are acute beds; that is, about two-thirds of the beds at present under construction, whereas in the completions since 1965 about two-thirds were long-stay beds. As the district general hospital programme gets under way, a higher proportion of the programme will be devoted to acute beds, including short-stay geriatric and psychiatric beds at general hospitals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the important subject of value for money in hospital building, some indication was given of what we were doing in the debate on 23rd May. I should like to make
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0268">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>109</span>
special reference here to our report on the evaluation of the Falkirk Ward, S.S.H.D. Hospital Design in the Note No. 4, and to the section in it entitled "Standards and Costs." This Section makes an analysis of the cost of the ward unit, taking each of its special design features in turn, costing it and discussing its advantages. A particular point about the Falkirk Ward, and indeed about our hospital planning in general, is the emphasis it gives to the provision of good quality accommodation which will be versatile in use. This is our main insurance against the changing needs and patterns of use not only in ward units but also in outpatient departments, health centres, maternity units and units for dealing with accidents and emergencies. Suitability for multiple uses in the patient-care areas means a higher intensity of use and thus enables fewer rooms to suffice for a given work load. Detailed studies have shown that it is practical to design many areas of accommodation in this way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to the subject of revenue expenditure and the demands made upon it. Since 1964 the amount of money we have been able to devote to hospital revenue expenditure has increased each year by never less than 2½ per cent.—indeed from 1966 by some 3½ per cent. annually in real terms. The cumulative effects of this have been substantial. For example, a 1 per cent. growth in hospital revenue in 1964 meant an addition of £660,000 while in the present year it means an addition of £1,070,000. In total figures the hospital revenue allocation has increased over the last five years from about £71 million to nearly £111 million, an increase of over 55 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite the very real advances that have been made, it is, of course, true that the pressures of current financial restraints are present in varying degrees throughout every sector of the public services. In that sense the hospital service is not unique. Medical advances, however, are such that there has probably never been a time when the Service has not been under financial pressure, but the fact is that during the last year or two a very considerable number of developments, with major financial implications, have been brought to the attention of the hospital service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have, for example, been a number of reports making recommendations about the need for development in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>110</span>
various parts of the service, including the Royal Commission on Medical Education, the Salmon Committee on Senior Nurse Staffing Structure, the Zuckerman Committee on Hospital Scientific Services, and the Tunbridge Committee on the Health of Hospital Staff. At the same time negotiations with the medical profession have shown the need for increased expenditure to make it possible to extend study-leave facilities and to permit minimum time off duty; and medical developments have led to a considerable increase in expenditure on drugs, sterile supplies and X-ray laboratory services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not just a question of the building of hospitals but a matter of what goes into it in the form of all the new mechanical needs and technical needs of the hospital. The cost is ever a challenge. Even before all these desirable elements can be considered, the cost of staffing and running the new buildings provided from our expanding capital programme has to be met. This amounts to a considerable sum each year, especially when a new hospital is being opened. In the current year nearly half, 45 per cent., of the total increase is required for this purpose. This means that the additional revenue available in any particular year is always stretched to meet the extra demands on it, and any desirable developments, therefore, take rather longer to introduce than we would like.

The regional hospital boards are bound to be faced with difficulty in selecting priorities, and I want to pay my tribute to the devoted service and care and concern of all these boards in determining what the priorities will be. It is easy to say because there is something here, why not there? I have met these men—my hon. Friend the Under Secretary of State has met them oftener—and their concern for getting the priorities right is something that merits our congratulation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

To turn to one particular report, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Services has announced his intention to set up a Hospital Advisory Service in the light of the position disclosed by the report on conditions at Ely Hospital, Cardiff, and hon. Members may wish to know what we propose for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position in Scotland is, perhaps, different from the position in England and Wales in two main respects. First, we have in the past tended to devote a higher proportion of our resources to long-stay hospitals, particularly geriatric hospitals. Secondly, we have in Scotland the Mental Welfare Commission, which was set up under the Mental Health (Scotland) Act, 1960, to watch over the interests of individual patients suffering from mental disorder, with power to order the discharge of patients who are compulsorily detained. As regards finance, all regional boards have been asked to review the position of their long-stay hospitals in the light of the Ely report and to consider how far a proper share of resources is being devoted to these hospitals. On the capital side, we shall continue to pay particular attention to long-stay hospitals when deciding on the hospital building programme for future years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards the Mental Welfare Commission, perhaps I could digress to say a few words about the Commission and its Work. The Commission, unlike the Mental Health Review Tribunals in the South, is concerned with the general interests of mental patients and not only with the question of their discharge. Some hon. Members have asked Questions in the House, the Answers to which may have on the face of it indicated that a much higher proportion of detained patients in England and Wales have been discharged through the Mental Health Review Tribunals than by the Mental Welfare Commission and the sheriff in Scotland. I discussed this position with the Commission recently, and it has pointed out that it is its policy that the decision about
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>112</span>
discharge should, wherever possible, rest with the responsible medical officer. It prefers to discuss cases informally with him rather than to discharge patients itself, and it believes that in a significant number of cases these discussions have resulted in the discharge of the patient to informal status. In the nature of these, it is, of course, difficult to provide statistics of this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Returning to the hospital Advisory Service, we considered first whether the rôle of the Mental Welfare Commission should be expanded to cover both the needs of individual patients in all long-stay hospitals and the general running of such hospitals. There would be two difficulties about this. First, any such change would require legislation. Secondly, we felt that there would be advantages in having the service, which would be primarily concerned with the general improvement of standards, rather than with the position of individual patients, closely identified with the normal machinery for running the hospitals and effecting any necessary improvements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Mental Welfare Commission, when I discussed this with it, accepted the view that its rôle should not be expanded in this way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our present plan is to set up an Advisory Service which would, perhaps, be on slightly less formal lines than the service in England and Wales and would be closely associated with the normal Departmental and regional machinery. The main component of the service would be a Departmental team, including medical, nursing and lay staff with assistance as required from other experts. I hope that regional board officers would be associated with the Departmental team, particularly in visits to hospitals. At the outset, at least, the service would deal only with long-stay hospitals and long-stay units in other hospitals, and we have started collecting information about these as a basis for its work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Dempsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder if my right hon. Friend would say, will this Advisory Service have full-time paid men or part-time paid men, or will it be wholly voluntary?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, in that they are Departmental staff devoting their work to it there will be the full-time members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall of course discuss the details of the arrangements with representatives of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0270">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>113</span>
hospital authorities, and professional and staff organisations will be kept informed. I should be interested to hear the reactions of hon. Members to this general outline of our proposals, which might be better suited to conditions in Scotland than a more formal structure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also intend to consider whether the rôle of the Mental Welfare Commission should be expanded to cover the interests of patients in all long-term hospitals and not only in mental and mental deficiency hospitals, but this will require considerable thought, and, as I have said, would require legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would draw to the attention of Members of the Committee the Report of the Working Party on Suggestions and Complaints in Hospital published on Friday last. We have asked for comments on this, but it is too early to give any indication of the comments on the recommendations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman mentioned the Abortion Act. I am glad he did so and I should say a few words about it. In Scotland we have no evidence that in general the Act is causing difficulty or is not working in the way that was intended. During the first year of its operation, from 27th April, 1968, to 26th April, 1969, 2,466 abortion operations have been notified as taking place under the Act, including only 58 in "approved places" other than National Health Service hospitals. Only seven such places are currently approved and these are obviously genuine nursing homes and not abortion clinics with queues of miserable women such as we have read about in the newspapers. There has been no evidence of any steep increase in the monthly numbers, although there has been some. In the middle of 1968 the number was running at about 190 a month and in the early months of 1969 at about 230 a month. The indications are that this is flattening out rather than rising, but we will keep a watch on this. It would appear, too, that women are not having to migrate from one hospital area to another in order to obtain this treatment. Analysis of the notification forms, which record the usual place of residence of the pregnant woman, has yielded no evidence of such migration. Up to 31st December last only 65 women who were operated on in England and Wales had a Scottish place of residence, and five who underwent the operation in Scottish hospitals came from other parts of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>114</span>
United Kingdom. We have little evidence of women from outwith the United Kingdom coming to Scotland to obtain abortions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The one case which has caused us all very great anxiety is the death of a baby at Stobhill Hospital following an abortion operation, which was the subject of a fatal accident enquiry. I have only recently received the transcript of evidence on this case—it amounted to over 350 pages—and I want to study it carefully, so I am not able to make a statement, but I shall keep hon. Members fully informed of developments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Member said something about family planning. Let us put this into its right place. Through local authority clinics, the family doctor service and the hospital and specialist services, the Health Service already covers all cases where advice on family planning is needed and all cases where treatment is required on medical grounds. Perhaps it is relevant to remind the Committee that in 1966 the terms of service of general practitioners were amended to enable them to make a reasonable charge for prescribing the pill or for providing and fitting a contraceptive appliance for their National Health Service patients as a private service if only social grounds were involved. This removed a definite obstacle to the wider availability of family planning services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only current point at issue, therefore, is the widening of the powers of local health authorities also to cover those cases where the need arises solely on social grounds. We have already made statutory provision in the Health Services and Public Health Act to confer the necessary additional powers on local authorities. This section of the Act, like some other desirable features has not yet been brought formally into operation. I have had to tell local authorities not to do this, and suggest not to do that, and go easy on expenditure if they want to maintain control of the rate position. That is the position in regard to this section of the Act. It has not been brought formally into operation because we thought it necessary to restrict the new responsibilities being placed on local authorities. I recognise that this has disappointed some people, although I have no reason to believe that Scottish local authorities have in general regarded it as an unreasonable one. They are aware that the present position is purely temporary and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0271">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>115</span>
is being kept under continuous review.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John P. Mackintosh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my right hon. Friend indicate to the Committee the amount of expenditure which would be involved in bringing this Section of the Act into operation? Although they belong to different sectors of government, one cannot help feeling that if even a few abortion operations were saved by wider knowledge of family planning the total saving to the community, apart from emotional terms, would be great.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept this. This would be at the discretion of the local authorities even when we did confer this power, so it is difficult to say how much it would be and it is necessary to balance this in relation to the principle of telling a local authority in respect of other services which it thinks are important. I have had no representation from any local authority in respect of this and I would have thought that the initial impulse would have come from there. We are bearing this in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. J. Grimond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: —</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have nearly finished. I want to get on. I want not to take too much time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grimond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the Secretary of State. I may have missed this, but did he give any indication when this section might be brought into effect?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I said the position was only temporary, and we hoped that the position could be eased to enable us to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I want to highlight a development which has considerable effect on the efficacy of the working of what I consider is the backbone of the service, the G.P. services—the steady expansion of the provision of health centres. The hon. Gentleman referred to this, too, Before 1964 there were three health centres in Scotland, at Edinburgh, Stranraer and Cumbernauld. Since 1964 eight have been opened, at Huntly, Cumbernauld Town Centre, Langholm, Livingston, Golspie, Curriehill, Kilsyth and Grangemouth, the last four built by local health authorities under delegated powers. In addition six are under construction, at Blackburn, Blackridge, Crieff, Keith, Thurso and Stenhousemuir, and plans have been approved for another 14 and pro-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>116</span>
for about 60 more centres are under consideration. In fact we have moved very quickly from a situation in which relatively little interest was being expressed in health centres to one in which we are faced with proposals for establishing a chain of health centres from Lerwick to Kirkcudbright.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All hon. Members will agree, I think, that it is right to devote resources in this way to front-line medical care which is provided by general practitioners. Nor is there likely to be much criticism of the priorities adopted within this field, with new towns and the major redevelopment areas of Glasgow having first priority, but consideration also being given to the incorporation of a health centre wherever a new hospital is being planned in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position in Glasgow is, I think, of more than purely local interest. The advice of the Joint Medical Services Committee, which was set up in Glasgow primarily to plan the health centre programme, was that priority be given to centres at Wood-side, Gorbals, Townhead, Govan, the Western Infirmary and the Bridgeton Gallowgate and Denniston area. Detailed consideration has already been given to the first four projects and it is hoped that building work will begin this year at Woodside, with the centre in operation in 1970. This centre will include a university medical research and training unit. For Gorbals the site has been selected and the provisional completion date is 1972. The Townhead centre has been sited at the Royal Infirmary and will be included in phase 1 of the Royal Infirmary development, scheduled for the years 1972 to 1976. Sketch plans have already been agreed, and discussions have been opened with the corporation about a suitable site for the Govan centre.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not merely providing health centres in the vague hope that better centres will mean a better service. Hon. Members may have noted from the 1968 Report on Health and Welfare Services that the Research and Intelligence Unit of the Scottish Home and Health Department is providing financial support for an inquiry into the pattern of medical care before and after the entry of doctors into a health centre. I have little doubt that factual information of this kind will offer us some useful insight into the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0272">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>117</span>
preferences of both doctors and patients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Galloway has reminded us that last Saturday completed the first 21 years of the National Health Service. I believe everyone who was there at the commencement of the Service can have a considerable measure of pride in the development of the Service and the work of those engaged in it, and I was glad that the hon. Gentleman mentioned the voluntary workers, because they play a considerable part in the Service. What we have achieved has been a National Health Service with local participation and local concern. It is a matter of pride that in these years we have been able to build up such a Service, which has become an essential part of the social life of the community, and I am very glad indeed at the way in which the hon. Gentleman has paid this tribute, and for the kind of report that I have been able to give.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to begin my brief remarks by echoing the words just uttered by the Secretary of State. I believe too many of us take for granted the benefits of our Health Service in this country. One only has to go abroad to other countries where there is no similar sort of Service in order to realise that our Health Service is not merely something which we have come to expect as normal but that, without it, the normal form of life for many families in this country would become extremely difficult. I was particularly impressed last autumn when I was in the United States of America and was able to compare the facilities available to the ordinary citizen there with those available in this country. I have no hesitation in echoing the words of the Secretary of State and saying that we are extremely lucky—and perhaps without being too smug I might add, extremely wise—in having such a fine Service for the people of this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From time to time many of us criticise the various aspects of the Health Service but I am sure this will be seen in a helpful and constructive light and certainly not as reflecting any harsh or adverse criticism.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman not also indicate that the United States of America is not an example of good medical treatment? If the hon. Gentleman looks not west but east he will find some excellent examples of health services in those parts of the world.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>118</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think the hon. Gentleman is entirely correct when he says that, but I do not want to be diverted into a discussion on that subject. In the United States I certainly saw some examples of extremely bad treatment, but I also saw some of extremely good treatment. I must say that most of it was beyond the pocket of the ordinary person.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. Precisely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may now deal with the Report that is before us, in the first place I should like to say a few words about the Green Paper. I welcome the remarks of the Secretary of State and the reactions which have been evident. In particular I am glad to hear that there is to be no going back on the ideas put in the Green Paper, as there has been, I believe, south of the Border, where there appears to be a substantial body of opinion opposed to the ideas of the English Green Paper. My own opinion coincides with what the Secretary of State said, that the great body of opinion in Scotland thinks the Green Paper is a good starting point for considering the reorganisation of our Health Service. I am glad the Secretary of State has welcomed the comments which have been made and intends to proceed to further consultation along the fines of the Green Paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards the future organisation of the Health Service, I have always felt that the unitary structure was most desirable. If I may give one reason for this, it is that, if one gets away from the professional and technical viewpoints within the Health Service of whether there should be a unitary or a two-tier system, I have never found it possible to explain to ordinary members of the general public how the tripartite division is made up and how it functions. Numbers of people come to see their Member of Parliament with problems about the Health Service, without having any idea that there are now three different sections of it, and without appreciating which part is relevant to their problems. This points to the fact that the Green Paper is right in suggesting that it all ought to be brought under one organisation, because the public will then know whom to see about what they regard generally as the "health service."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I notice that the local authorities are much less enthusiastic about the Green Paper proposals than are many other people. I can only say this about their
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0273">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>119</span>
suggestion that the health boards should be entirely under the control of local authorities in the future. I am all for giving local authorities as much control as possible of what goes on within their boundaries, but to load on to local authorities, even the new ones which will come eventually after the Wheatley proposals are implemented, the running of a vast, hugely expensive, and highly technical service such as the Health Service, without any power for local authorities to provide the money for it, because most of the money must come from central Government, would be to compound some of the ill effects of the present system of local government which we are trying to avoid. The closer the relationship between what local authorities have to do and their responsibility for providing the money to do it, the better local government we will get. I am not pretending that any local government set-up in our lifetime will ever operate entirely by means of its own finances; there will always be some central Government finance in it. Certainly I do not think it would be to the advantage of the Health Service itself. However, I agree with what the Secretary of State said, that if we could make the new health boundaries the same as the local government boundaries this would be helpful administratively in many ways. I certainly support that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of hospital building the Secretary of State had quite a bit to say, and he was able to tell us about the building progress which has been made during the year. I was glad at what he called the "sustained advance" which has taken place during the year. However, I think we would not be correct to let this review of the year go by without pointing a finger at one or two of the more disturbing facts of hospital building which have been brought to our notice in the past year. In particular I must refer to the cutback which had to be made earlier this year because of two factors. The first was the unfortunate collapse of the Sick Children's Hospital in Glasgow, which nobody could have foreseen but which required the diversion of further funds. The second was a truly remarkable escalation in the costs of existing programmes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without wishing to carp in any way I think the Government and the Minister owe us a little more explanation as to how it is that these very large increases in cost
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>120</span>
have taken place during the course of these building operations. The new Ninewells Hospital and the Medical School at Dundee is perhaps the most outstanding example, having originally been estimated to cost £10.2 million in 1963, when work started, whereas the cost is now £15.8 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When work started in 1963? Did work start in 1963?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the right hon. Gentleman will allow me to continue, what I am saying is that the estimates of the cost started at one figure of £10.2 million and went up to £15.8 million by the time it got to its present stage. I hope the Secretary of State will not be too sensitive about this, because it is a matter of legitimate public concern, and no doubt he will see that his hon. Friend gives us the answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then there is the cost of the Gartnavel hospital. This rose from £5 million to £6.8 million, and there was the Glasgow dental hospital redevelopment, which rose from £1.4 million to £2 million. That is a very large increase in terms of percentage. Of course we all know that there are changes in design—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Bruce Millan)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I interrupt the hon. Gentleman?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman would allow me to finish this. I do not think he should be too sensitive about this. I am not trying to lambast him with terrible criticism. I am merely raising perfectly legitimate matters which should be raised, and in due course he can give me the answers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These increases in cost are fairly considerable and he should have reported to us why they have taken place. I suggest that there are two possible factors which ought to be—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I just explain to the hon. Gentleman? Because I dealt with this during an Adjournment debate on 23rd May. The hon. Gentleman is quoting from the estimates. I then pointed out that one of the differences between the original and subsequent estimates was that in the second stage the final figures included equipment costs. For example, at Ninewells equipment costs amount to at least £2½ million. In many of the other instances the differences are largely because the second figures given include items
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0274">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>121</span>
which could not be included in the first estimates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. He did make those points, and I am sure that everything he said is absolutely correct. But—and I do not blame the hon. Gentleman himself—what is the point of putting up a programme with estimates on one basis and five years later finding that other matters must be included and having to cut back some of the hospital building programme?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has it all wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not in dispute that earlier this year, between January and March, it was necessary to cut back the hospital building programme to some extent. The cutback was announced by the Secretary of State and there was a great deal in the newspapers about it for many weeks. I am not saying that the Government were wrong to do this, but if we started on the programme some years ago on one basis of estimates and now find that we must cut back, there must be a reason. Part of it is the Sick Children's Hospital in Glasgow and part is increasing costs. The Secretary of State himself said that, but he is now saying that the increasing costs are due to including equipment in the second estimate and not in the first. We are entitled to know exactly what the figures amount to. If the increase in equipment accounts for the whole costs—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend rightly says, it does not. The right hon. Gentleman's estimating procedure should be put right so that this is allowed for at the beginning. He cannot have it both ways. Either he was allowing for the whole increase or he was not. If he was, then the hon. Gentleman has answered the question. If not, the other increases of cost should have been taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we accept that there is a case to answer on these exceptional increases in costs it is impossible to escape the feeling that the normal escalation in cost of construction work must have been greater than the Department expected, five, six or seven years ago when the plans were
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>122</span>
made. General inflation during those years and the impositions on people in the construction industry, including S.E.T., have had some effect which could not be foreseen some years ago. If that is part of the increase, we must ask the Government to bear in mind, when considering such things, that they have a measurable and noticeable effect on a programme such as the hospital building programme, and they should try to do something about it. If I can be told that the cutback earlier this year was absolutely unavoidable and nothing to do with any problem except the new equipment included in the second estimate and the unfortunate situation at the Sick Children's Hospital, Glasgow, I shall be absolutely satisfied, but I am certain that I cannot be told that, because the increases have been much greater than was expected or is explained by either of those two points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to draw attention to some of the effects of this difficulty in the programme in certain places, and I must particularly refer to my own part of the world—in Ayrshire. The right hon. Gentleman will know only too well that it was necessary to postpone by five or six months the start of the North Ayrshire General Hospital, now due to start in March, 1971, I understand. It can, therefore, be expected to finish building by about 1975, if it is reasonably straightforward. In last year's debate I spoke about the extremely serious result in North Ayrshire of not having the hospital completed till 1975. The situation would, perhaps, be a bit difficult if the area were to remain as it is, but with the advent of Irvine New Town, which will produce a large number of new inhabitants before then, there will be great problems in the next few years before the new North Ayrshire Hospital is opened. What is the Minister's latest estimate of the completion date of the North Ayrshire Hospital, and by how much the Irvine New Town population will have increased by then? That is the extent of the problem which will face the hospital service in north Ayrshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A corresponding problem arises partly from this delay in south Ayrshire. The start of the South Ayrshire Hospital was delayed five years ago, and it is not now scheduled to be completed till 1979 at the very best. This causes great concern in south Ayrshire, because it is well known
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0275">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>123</span>
that the existing hospitals there have been living from hand to mouth as regards keeping the fabric of the building going. We shall now face another 10 years in which we shall always be expecting to have the new hospital coming along and not be able to do the important improvements which one would normally do to keep the existing hospitals going. For instance, things like replacing equipment become very difficult when one has a five- to 10-year question mark hanging over future expenditure on hospitals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An allied feature that is causing great concern in south Ayrshire is the position of the nurse training schools after the production of the new hospitals. When the North Ayrshire Hospital is completed in about 1975 there is a proposal that the nurse training schools should be concentrated on it. Those of us who are concerned with the South Ayrshire Hospital are worried that this will be a disadvantage to the South Ayrshire nurse-training facilities, which are exceptionally good and have been extremely well run for many years. It is feared that if the new North Ayrshire Hospital has at least five years start on the South Ayrshire Hospital there will be a hiatus in the nurse training situation in south Ayrshire when the beautiful new hospital in north Ayrshire is set up as the main nurse-training school for the whole area. This is very disturbing to the people of south Ayrshire because the majority now training come from south Ayrshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to look very sympathetically at this as a genuine cause for concern, and either consider maintaining the nurse-training school in both hospitals or postponing the moving of nurse-training facilities from South Ayrshire Hospital to the new North Ayrshire Hospital at least till both are renewed and up to date. People in the area firmly hold this view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I have three short questions. I am glad to see from this year's Report that we appear to have more junior hospital doctors than we have had for some time. What progress is being made, or has been made, to make their living conditions better? There has been great progress in many parts, but the Minister should aim to see, as I am sure he does, that as far as possible the junior hospital doctor should be able to live the normal life of a married man with a family, and should
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>124</span>
not be restricted in where he can live, unless this is absolutely necessary. Many hospitals now have married quarters for these doctors and this is very desirable, if it can be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Second, last year I raised the question of visiting hours, and the Minister was able to give an encouraging report then about the improvement and liberalising of visiting hours. He told me that it was now virtually routine in children's hospitals for visiting to be more or less whenever parents wished, with certain obvious exceptions in infectious cases and that sort of thing. What progress has been made in liberalising visiting hours generally in hospitals? Particularly when people have to travel long distances, as they do in many cases, it is exceptionally irritating and difficult if visiting hours are restricted to a straight two-hour period. It is very desirable that there should be as much liberalisation as possible of visiting hours generally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Third, I was very glad to hear what the right hon. Gentleman said about the Report on complaints published recently. He said that he would study it very carefully. Are we likely within a few weeks, or by the autumn, to have a statement on hospital complaints? It is important that the public should be fully informed as to exactly how complaints are to be made in general in the future and that they should be encouraged to make use of the facilities. Only in that way will they be able to feel that they are really being consulted on what they think of the hospital service.

I congratulate the Secretary of State on the report he produced for us this morning, and hope that we can look forward to a further year of progress in the Health Service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) delivers his speeches in a pleasant fashion—but trusts my right hon. Friend with suspicion, to use a phrase which I think makes my point. He is very happy about the Health Service, but goes on, I think unfairly, to talk about the amount of building of hospitals. One of his problems was that in Ayrshire there is a difficulty over what to do with the hospitals now being built. That is a different situation from the one some years ago, when there were no hospitals in prospect. The problem now is what purposes to put one hospital in

south Ayrshire to as against one in north Ayrshire.

I agree with some of the hon. Gentleman's earlier remarks. He was right to highlight the difference between the services provided in this country and those provided abroad. Like the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North (Earl of Dalkeith) I was in Australia at the end of last year and one found that on personal visits to dentists and doctors there people were paying five, six and eight dollars—£2 to £4—for one consultation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Lawson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did my hon. Friend notice that in America or Canada they were charging 40 dollars to someone who was not able to go back from holiday?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I shall not take up too much time developing this point, because I think that it has been made, but we would hope that the publicity given to these things would be even greater, so that our people would have a higher appreciation of what our Health Service means to our families and to the nation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot follow the wide scope of the speech of the hon. Gentleman the Member for Galloway (Mr. Brewis) who opened the debate. I appreciated it very much. It was compact, and yet covered most of the points, some of which I hope to take up.

I begin with a rather pedestrian point. I have been informed, and believe, that there is a gap in the Health Service, particularly the dental service, which I have not yet been able to pinpoint exactly, in respect of emergency treatment for those suffering from dental pain particularly at weekends. It is not good enough to answer, as my hon. Friend did, that most dentists will provide emergency treatment for their own patients. He admitted that he was not satisfied that there was sufficient demand to justify the establishment of special arrangements. Although we all hope that the demand would be low because of the high standard of dental health, we are here dealing with emergencies, and the problem at weekends of visitors, seamen, and children, is becoming severe. A service should be available. The Report states that 139 dentists are employed in hospitals in the Health Service. Where are these dentists?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>126</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware that, in the circumstances which he is portraying, a dentist will tell his patient that details of the emergency services are to be found tabulated in the post offices but that post offices are shut on Sundays?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All I am asking is that the dentists should provide a service, possibly by rota, and that perhaps one, two or three dentists, for example in Glasgow, should be available in hospitals and be known to be available to people who are suffering in this way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archie Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not my hon. Friend agree that if the school dental service were properly staffed there would possibly not be so many emergencies among children at the weekends? Does not he further agree that if families had family dentists, as they have family doctors such emergencies would not occur so frequently?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to pursue this too far, as I do not think this will solve the problem. Even a family dentist would not always be available; he would want his Saturday afternoon and Sunday off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As is stated in paragraph 8.22 of the Report, the five new health centres will have facilities for medical diagnosis, and three of them will have accommodation for general or local authority dental services. Are full-time dentists employed there? If so, why should not one or two be employed in hospitals in Glasgow?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Glasgow was mentioned in the Montgomery Report as one of the areas which did not meet the requirements of that Report in the proportion of births taking place at home and in hospital. I am glad to note that the reduction in the number of home confinements has continued in the past year, and that in 1966 there were only 8 per cent. compared with 10 per cent. in 1967 and 12 per cent. in 1966. We all welcome this improvement. We all know that Aberdeen has a wonderful record. In Aberdeen, 97 per cent. of all confinements are in hospitals, and Aberdeen is to be congratulated, but will my hon. Friend say what is the position in Glasgow? We welcome the fact that the stillbirth rate of 14.8 per 1,000 is the lowest recorded, and that the maternity death rate of 0.13 per 1,000 is at a record low level. These are very good figures, and all concerned are to be congratulated.

I am a little perturbed about the medical records of children at school, although good reasons are given for what seems to be a deterioration. As a result of new methods of recording the health history of children at school, 51 per cent. of the boys and 47 per cent. of the girls were found to have defects. This extraordinarily high figure was a revelation to me. The explanation apparently lies in the earlier and better diagnosis made by doctors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures nevertheless show the value of the recent Education Bill in the early ascertainment of defects in children before they ever go to school. I am not indulging in party rancour, but this is an aspect of the Education Bill which should have been highlighted more than the payment of school fees. I hope that, with early ascertainment, these defects will be eradicated before the children ever go to school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference is made to this in respect of the health centre at Livingston. Special mention is made in the Report of the revision of practices and procedures to try to achieve a fully integrated service. The hon. Member for Galloway referred to this and mentioned difficulties. I agree that there are difficulties, but Livingston has carried out an experiment designed to provide medical oversight for all children throughout infancy and early childhood. Paragraph 2.8 of the Report states:
	<br><q><p>"Livingston has succeeded in bridging the artificial division between curative and preventive medicine, and on this account, may well become a prototype for Scotland."</p></q>
I am sure that we all wish it well in this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Since Livingston is in my constituency, and in both a public and a private capacity I have had a great deal to do with it, I would like to substantiate what my hon. Friend has been saying about Livingston.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have acknowledged that it was in my hon. Friend's constituency, but the Report places it in a Scottish setting, and it is cited as an example which may be of value to the whole of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that speedy action will be taken in Glasgow along the same lines. The Secretary of State for Scotland anticipated much of the criticism which I was about to vent upon his head in respect of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>128</span>
the lack of progress in the provision of health centres in Glasgow. As he said, health centres in Scotland may be provided directly by the Secretary of State or he may delegate his powers to a local authority, whereas in England it is the duty of the local authorities to provide them. There are now 11 health centres in operation, four provided by the local authorities under their delegated powers, and seven provided directly by the Secretary of State for Scotland. The Secretary of State gave information this morning about the future programme, and I shall have to read the OFFICIAL REPORT tomorrow to enable me to assimilate the information which he gave.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Report makes delightful and encouraging reading, especially paragraph 28, in which it is stated that the diagnostic facilities in a health centre in Edinburgh are available for general practitioners. This is an important point. I have at intervals in this Committee raised the problems of the general practitioners whom I have said were being used as the general labourers of the specialists and others in hospitals, and patients were far too often being sent to the specialist or to the outpatient department of a hospital instead of doctors having facilities in health centres to follow up themselves the diagnostic processes. At the health centres the doctors will have the assistance of qualified nurses, and it is mentioned that in Edinburgh they have access to the X-ray laboratory and to electrocardiography.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is wonderful, but what about the City of Glasgow? On 27 June it was reported in 	<i>The Glasgow Herald</i> that only on the day before, 26th June, was work started on the Woodside Centre. This is despite the fact that the Glasgow Executive Council has for a long time had their masterplan for 21 Health Centres. Despite the initiative of the Glasgow Executive Council in the forward planning of such centres, which were much admired and were the envy of other Executive Councils, Glasgow Executive Council now feels badly let down. There may be a good answer for it, and I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow Craigton (Mr. Millan), will have a good answer. I would like to hear it because, whereas this form of service is being debated in other areas, Glasgow is now so far behind, according to the Executive Spokesman, that it is a laughing-stock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>129</span>
The health centres should have been ready to take the place of surgeries in redevelopment areas of Glasgow. My right hon. Friend said that priority was given to the new towns and overspill areas. In Glasgow some surgeries are the only inhabited buildings in areas surrounded by derelict buildings. There are surgeries in my constituency which are quite inadequate and which lack any sense of dignity. There is one surgery with neither light nor water and I know of one patient who had to bring hot water in a flask to enable the doctor to syringe her ear. These are intolerable conditions. We have in this Committee recently been talking about "tolerable" and intolerable standards of housing. There are some surgeries which do not reach the "tolerable standard" enunciated in the recent Bill. This has been going on for a long time because a few doctors have not shown initiative in providing better facilities. It is no good the spokesman for the Executive making the excuse of the lack of centres. Doctors themselves could have done something along these lines. May I ask what is the position in Glasgow? Are health centres being built directly by the Secretary of State for Scotland or by the local authority? He mentioned the date when some health centres will start.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another matter to which I wish to refer which concerns the doctors' initiative. The General Practice Finance Corporation was set up under the 1966 Act to provide loans for general practitioners interested in improving facilities, but very few applications have been made to repair, to improve, or to build new, surgeries. I was told last year that no applications had been made because it was too soon after the passing of the Bill. In the year ending 31st March, 1969, according to the Report, 23 such applications were granted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever the difficulties, there is no doubt that many surgeries and consulting rooms lack heating, lighting and ventilation, and some even sitting accommodation for waiting patients. Some have no receptionist, and the patients have to follow one another in and tell one another who succeeds whom. In these twilight areas particularly there is need for urgent action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend will pay some regard to the matter.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am afraid that I have exceeded my time, and I am sorry if the main burden of my remarks seems to have been of a critical nature. But it is when the Service is in actual contact with patients that it is so important to have the correct public relations in the presentation of the Service. I do not intend to make any girning or churlish criticism of doctors, nurses and others who serve the community in such a splendid fashion, and I yield to nobody in my admiration for them, but I hope that we shall present a Service in better terms of actual relationships, and thereby seal the bond between the community and the Service as a whole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Clark Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Report makes interesting reading, and I congratulate the Secretary of State on its production. I have only one or two observations to make, and they may be of a rather unusual nature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First of all I would like to pay tribute to the doctors and nurses in Scotland. They do a great deal for us all, and they do not always get the praise which they merit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to ask the Minister to look into three small points. There is no doubt that a great deal of research is going on in Scotland, some of which is rather obscure, and some straightforward. I have raised this point once or twice before, but I raise it again because very little seems to have been done to find cures for the common cold. This rather simple subject causes more misery and more absenteeism from factory and office possibly than any other cause, and it is a great nuisance. Should not the battle against the common cold be stepped up a bit? Can the Minister say what is being done in the matter and what exchange of information, if any, is taking place so that we may benefit from the results of any experiments in other countries to deal with it? Recently we have heard about certain anomalies and injustices in salaries, meal allowances, and so on, for nurses and student nurses. These matters are the subject of negotiation in the Whitley Council and I think many of the injustices have been straightened out, but a bit of a tangle still seems to remain over some of these matters, and I would ask the Minister to keep an eye on this and perhaps to ask himself whether it is not now time to have a commission to review the whole structure.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>131</span>
On the matter of hospitals I realise the complexity of the matter and the difficulties, since under any Government funds are limited, but recently I saw over the Peel Hospital in the Borders and spent an interesting afternoon there. It is situated in a quite absurd place and I would ask the Scottish Office to rebuild it at a convenient point in the Borders. This matter deserves high priority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to other matters connected with medical and health subjects, namely euthanasia and transplants. On euthanasia my views are short and to the point. I am not a believer in legalised murder. In the House recently we have seen the objectionable habit being established of the Government, while declaring their neutrality, giving extra time to Private Members' Bills. May I have an absolute assurance from the Government, and particularly from the Scottish Office, that they are absolutely opposed to euthanasia and will oppose any Bill brought forward on those lines?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard a great deal in the newspapers and elsewhere about transplants, but there has not been much official pronouncement. Personally, I do not mind people leaving their organs for medical use or to help others, provided it is clearly their wish. There are, however, great difficulties in establishing that it is their wish, and the possibilities of error are great. I have been a bit disturbed by some of the reports on heart transplants, for example. There would seem to me to be scope for mistakes about the conditions of the organs themselves. I cannot, for instance, imagine my own kidneys or even my eyes being any good to anybody. What gives rise to doubt and real consternation is the view which seems to be creeping in in some quarters that all our organs should be available for use when we die unless it is specified otherwise. This is a ghastly proposal, and upon my soul, I would have thought that in death at least our bodies would have been left in peace. I wish to state here and now—and I think I speak for most Scots—that I do not want my body or my organs nationalised. In regard to any question of disposal the rule should be one of contracting in, and not of contracting out. It should be left to the individual to take the initiative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the question of abortion. There is not very much about this in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>132</span>
the Report, but the Secretary of State did say something about it. As hon. Members know, the law in Scotland was changed recently, and it is now the same throughout the United Kingdom. In recent days we have been reading about scandalous abortion clinics in London, about cut rates, about information given by taxi drivers, and women coming from Scandinavia and elsewhere. Then there was the horrible case in Glasgow mentioned by the right hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Abortion Act is thoroughly bad, and has proved to be bad, and, of course, it was introduced by a Liberal, and the Liberal Party has always been a party of humbug and mismanagement. The law of Scotland was perfectly sound before the Act. Many of us advocated that Scotland should be excluded from the Act. But no. There is always some ghoul anxious to change things, usually for the worse, and the Liberals, and others, would not listen to our plea for our Amendment and that piece of reason. They had their dictatorial way, and Scotland has been saddled with this wrong, ill-drafted Act, with the wrongful help of the Government in giving extra Parliamentary time for it. The disastrous results are there for everybody to see in England, and it is my fear that that amendment, made in the law in Scotland may lead to the same thing happening there. Are the Government prepared to amend the Act totally? Will they amend it so as to leave the position in Scotland as it was before the Act was passed? Are the Scottish Office keeping a close watch on developments generally? Because there is great scope for fear in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I received a little billet doux telling me when I should cease talking, Mr. Robertson, I would not have worried in the least if the hon. Gentleman the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison), who was telling us about his organs, had suddenly lost one and been compelled to sit down a minute or two earlier; because my time is very much limited, unfortunately for me if not for my audience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wanted to deal with only one point, but having heard one or two hon. Members refer to the fact that we are celebrating the majority of this great Service, it reminded me of the fact that I was with the Service at the beginning. I served on
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0280">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>133</span>
the Scottish Committee and also, for some unknown reason, on the English Committee. Perhaps I was there to watch that England did not get too much money, or more money relative to Scotland; but I had the pleasure of serving on both Committees 21 years ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to have heard my right hon. Friend emphasise that during those 21 years we have spent £76 million on the Scottish Service. That is a tremendous sum of money in a relative sense, even compared with the fact that the English Service within the next few years will probably be absorbing £3,000 million, if it is to meet all the demands being made upon it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During those 21 years we have constructed hospital buildings to the tune of £54½ million in places where they would never have been built were it not for the creation of this Service. One of the great things the Health Service has done is to push medicine and all that is associated with it, the hospitals and staff, out from the concentrated city areas into the country. We have moved the Service outwards into places where medicine was almost unknown and we are still doing so. The Service still has a great job to do. There are areas which it does not touch, except through the medium of Long John. I hope that job will continue, and I am sure it will continue, even though it may cost a great deal in £ s. d. Last year we spent over £10 million on the Service. Measured in any terms for a small country like Scotland these are figures of which we ought to be proud and we ought to say so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This service is an expanding one.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want particularly to look at the general practitioner side. Here, there is a good deal of dissatisfaction. Doctors are leaving it and going abroad to richer fields. We cannot afford to lose those doctors. On page 122 it is said that in 1960 there were 2,914 doctors in the general practitioner service; by 1968 that number had dropped to 2,709, a diminution of 205 doctors. I disagree with the hon. Gentleman the Member for Galloway (Mr. Brewis) who said there was only a small fall in numbers, but when one thinks of the number of patients who would be treated by 205 doctors we can see that this is more than we can afford to lose. The number of doctors in the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>134</span>
hospital service has increased by 733. The number has risen from 2,874 doctors in 1960 to 3,611 doctors in 1968. Doctors in the local authority services have increased from 289 to 382.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be many reasons for that, but from my contact with the doctors the basic reason lies in the fact that in the hospital service and in the local authority service the doctor knows when his day starts and when it finishes; he has a definite number of hours to work. In the general practitioner service he has a 24 hour day, seven days a week, 365 days a year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am talking about the doctors in the general practitioner service and it is quite untrue to say that for some of them the hours are as I stipulated and for others not, because they are under obligation to carry out that period of service, and it is up to them to find ways of getting a more rational day. The onus is thrust on them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure my hon. Friend will be aware that there has been a great controversy in Lanarkshire in relation to consortiums which have been formed by general practitioners. Within these consortiums every doctor gets at least two days off a week regularly and we find now that they are not prepared to give the patients adequate time to visit them and to make the visiting hours available to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I am aware of what my hon. Friend has said, but I indicated that the doctor had a daily programme to meet and he has to try to modify it. It is open to him to make private arrangements and doctors have done so. But that does not absolve them from paying. They have to provide their own place for consultation which adds to their costs. Of course they cannot work the kind of day I have enunciated every day in the week. But there are doctors so situated in Scotland that they cannot have this sort of service, which has created another problem, that of cheap labour from outside infiltrating now into this country, and dealt with at the annual meeting of the British Medical Association last week. I am disappointed, because this cheaper and less efficient service will replace that of the doctors who are leaving Britain from the general

medical service. This is going to create a danger which I am sorry I cannot now deal with, but perhaps I shall have another opportunity to pursue this matter under easier conditions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Esmond Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for Govan (Mr. Rankin) for giving way at that point in the debate. I am personally grateful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to raise two short questions and, to use the phrase of my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger), two slightly longer questions. The first is essentially a supplementary question, on the issues posed by the Abortion Act, to the Minister when he comes to reply. It is specifically this. Can we have a breakdown—and it may not be possible for it to be provided this morning—of the geographical areas in which the 2,466 cases were treated? Because one of the disturbing features about the Act—and it is only one—is the degree to which discretionary power is exercised by doctors. We know from a breakdown of the figures for the N.H.S. as a whole that it is eight times easier to get an abortion in Aberdeen than it is in Liverpool. How much easier is it to get an abortion in Aberdeen than, let us say, in Glasgow or Edinburgh? I share my hon. Friend's concern on this matter and I believe it is a matter for debate in another place, but I believe it is essential that the Act should be amended and that only gynaecologists should be allowed to carry out these operations, and it should be insisted upon, in any amendment proposed, that these be done in N.H.S. hospitals. Is there a geographical racket as well as other forms of racket in this case and what is the position in Scotland?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second question is a reinforcement of the admirable remarks made by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Hannan). Like him, I am concerned about health centres. I do not wish to make a party point of this, though I did think there was a slight indication from the Secretary of State that health centres were a magic invention of the Labour Government. The Minister will recall that these were planned for Glasgow—to take Glasgow, for example, as the hon. Member for Maryhill mentioned it—back in 1964, and there were to be 21 health centres for the city.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>136</span>
I am concerned about going to my own doctor in conditions under which I think animals should not be treated; and I am very concerned when that same doctor tries to give me privileged treatment by suggesting that I call at his home, his private house. It is deplorable that in developing Glasgow, in 1969 and beyond, people should be treated in conditions certainly of squalor, and sometimes of positive filth, where their own health is concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to raise two points, one of which has only been marginally touched on, and the other not touched on at all and, I hope, not to be acted on at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like, in terms of the Green Paper, to ask for clarification of the Government's intentions. Am I right in thinking that the English Green Paper is a prototype—an inferior prototype I believe—and has been totally withdrawn, and is it a fact that, behind this cover of waiting for Wheatley, which is becoming the magic incantation these days, like waiting for Godot, the Green Paper will not be acted upon at all? It may be that some of the criticisms which have been made of it are worrying the Government. I do not share the hesitation. I believe that the Green Paper has in it a great deal that is admirable. What puzzles me is the relation between that Green Paper and the Birsay Report. I apologise for mentioning that since I had the honour of serving on the Birsay Committee, but I am surprised that a Green Paper which, I thought in my innocence, drew heavily on some of the proposals of the Birsay Report, excludes the Highlands and Islands except as part of the medical problems of Scotland. It seems to me that if there is a wish for experiment where medical administration is concerned that experiment could usefully begin in the Highlands and Islands. It is here that possibly the problems of centralisation versus local participation are at their sharpest. Here one attempts to ask the question, can the medical services be centralised on Inverness for the Highlands and Islands when so much of the administration is based on Aberdeen?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would ask the Minister, what has happened to Birsay? Has this, like everything else, been carefully locked away in a cupboard? If not, cannot he consider, in his plans for experiment, if he has a real interest in experiment, a small-scale experiment with Inverness as the

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>137</span>
centre for the Highlands and Islands, matching the Highlands and Islands Development Board? If that is too big a project cannot he pay some attention to trying to unite doctors for group services in the Orkneys, with air service, which would go some way to meeting the proposals of the Birsay Report?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grimond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Doctors in Orkney and Shetland are attached to Aberdeen, and would be deeply disappointed if they were removed from the teaching hospital at Aberdeen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully share this concern, which is the reason why I am raising the question. Nevertheless there was a great deal that was constructive in the Birsay Report and nothing at all has ever been said by the Government about the proposals for the Highlands and Islands practice allowance which was the most revolutionary proposal made in that Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

I wanted to raise essential questions which were to be my major contribution, the background to which the Secretary of State made no reference at all—the Report of the Working Party set up to review hospital endowments. Essentially this is a proposal with reference to the distribution of money for hospitals. I welcome parts of this, particularly the tribute to the work of the Western and Royal in Glasgow and the Edinburgh hospitals. I feel it is a contradictory document that can do a very real disservice to the future of the teaching hospitals in Scotland. It is shifting resources into the mental hospitals and away from the teaching hospitals. If one takes the figure in the Appendix, for instance, the Glasgow Western Infirmary, estimating the 5 per cent. return on its endowments, would get £7 2s. per year per bed as compared with £9 8s. and £8 4s. as against the present figure of £12 1s. at Edinburgh, and so on. We should remember that 8.9 per cent. of the doctors trained in the United Kingdom are trained at Glasgow. We should remember that medical education in Scotland is one of our great industries, and I believe this document is a serious threat to the whole future of medical education. It is a total contradiction to some of the points made in the Report of the Royal Commission on medical education, and in the latter document—which inci-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>138</span>
dentally runs contrary to much of the Green Paper—there was a proposal to set up a university hospital board. I believe this is the answer to the problem, that there ought to be a university hospital board controlling its own endowment and fostering the kind of work done by Dr. Cuthbertson and by the Kidney Unit in the Royal Infirmary. All these have come out of these endowments and I believe this Government are doing a long-term disservice if they do not recognise that fact.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In our debate last year we made congratulatory remarks to the National Health Service on its twentieth anniversary, and I recall making some reference also to the great march of medical science over recent generations, an advance which continues and gains pace as man's quest for discovery and devotion to his fellow men bring new miracles of achievement within our grasp. I suggest that is the background we must always keep in mind during these debates, and I trust that the probing questions which we must ask will not be regarded by doctors and nurses and voluntary workers as being any sort of criticism of them or of their fine work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There were many satisfactory points in the opening speech made by the Secretary of State this morning, and I am grateful to him for it, but there are some questions which must be asked, and I hope we shall get replies to them from the Minister. After all, that is one of the purposes of these debates, and, if I may say so, the Minister should not so often give the appearance of being offended and impatient because we dare to put some critical questions to him. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Hannan) and my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Wright) referred to the difficulties sometimes encountered by patients in some parts of Scotland. After all, they are the customers of the Health Service and it is right that the convenience of the customer should also be borne in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his outstanding opening speech this morning my hon. Friend referred to some of the concern that is being felt about the circumstances of abortions. This was also referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) in a characteristically vigorous speech, and the Secretary of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0283">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>139</span>
State was good enough to refer to this problem in his speech. I thought the remarks which the Secretary of State made about the effect of the Abortion Act in Scotland were reassuring. He referred to the Stobhill case, and I will say no more about that in the light of what he said. The interpretation of the Abortion Act has given much concern to some Members, as we were reminded by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Pollok. It will be for them to decide whether amendment to the Act is desirable. I have my own private opinion about this, which I hope to be able to demonstrate shortly, and I am sure other hon. Members have theirs. However, I am sure that the Committee will understand that from this position I do not think it is appropriate for me to say more on this problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this same context the Secretary of State referred to family planning, and I thought this was the weakest part of his speech. I hope we shall have a less indefinite statement from the Government before long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Galloway (Mr. Brewis) took as one of his themes the people who work in the Health Service, and he called attention to some facts which are matters for very real concern. The number of registered nurses has fallen. I know that the number of registered nurses who are employed full-time fell by 300 between March and September of last year. The total number was only 3.6 per cent. more than in 1964, although the number of patients discharged over approximately the same period rose by 9 per cent. As the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) reminded us, and also other hon. Gentlemen, the number of doctors providing general medical service has fallen again, so that the number of patients per doctor has increased. The hon. Gentleman also called attention to the disturbing level of immigrants among these doctors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may return to the nursing figures, another point of concern is that the number of student nurses has fallen by 600 over the same period, from 1964 to last year. In passing perhaps I may tell the hon. Gentleman that I am taking 1964 as my starting point, not to make any party point but simply because, in the document before us, 1964 happens to be the first year. Against this the number of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>140</span>
part-time nurses increased over those years, but it is clear that the pattern is shifting away from the employment of full-time fully trained staff and the service is more dependent on less qualified enrolled nurses. In his opening speech my hon. Friend called attention to the disturbing position among student nurses and pupil nurses. Between March, 1965, and March, 1968, there were never fewer than 6,000 student nurses undergoing the three-year period of training, and yet between those two dates the total complement of registered nurses increased by only 155. Again, between March, 1966, and March, 1968, there were never fewer than 2,000 pupil nurses undergoing a two-year course of training. Yet between those two dates the total complement of enrolled nurses increased by only 505. These are disturbing figures, and I am surprised that they were not commented on in the Departmental Report. This is a serious position, but there appears to be little recognition that the problem exists. It follows from these figures that there is a growing strain on our resources of people in the Service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As many hon. Members have said, there is also growing strain on our cash resources. The Secretary of State called our attention to the large hospital building programme, and I think he would agree that the progress he outlined is the type of progress we would expect. After all, the upsurge in hospital building over these last years springs from the hospital plans for Scotland of 1962 to 1964, which projected a hospital building programme to 1970–71, and I would remind the Secretary of State that the Government White Paper of 1966 stated that the review in it broadly accepted and reaffirmed the general objectives and the content of the earlier 10-year plans. In other words, these are programmes which we would expect. The difference, of course, is that the resources of which we depend now spring from a near stagnant economy. The National Plan, which envisaged an annual rate of growth, has been withdrawn. One effect of this is that, as the march of the hospital building programme continues, there is growing concern about the way in which this programme can be financed. This is added to by the worry in regard to the escalating cost of hospital building.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger), called attention to this
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0284">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>141</span>
and I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill seemed to think that it was in some way unfair for my hon. Friend to refer to this escalation. My hon. Friend referred to Ninewells. The hospital there is always cited by the Government as an example of the way in which estimates have to be continuously revised in order to keep pace with the advance of science. Sometimes I wonder to what extent Ninewells is quoted by the Government to give respectability to miscalculation. If Ninewells escalated so sharply because of the new techniques requiring unforeseen and expensive equipment—and I accept this in large part—why has the lesson not been learned and applied? Why have so many other hospital projects soared in cost? What corrective factor is being applied to their estimates to make some realistic allowance for the march of science which we know is happening and which surely can be provided for?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of this escalation was the postponement last year of 15 hospital building schemes. We read a phrase in paragraph 6.4 on page 74 of the Departmental Report, which says:
	<br><q><p>"Further adjustments to the programme were under consideration at the end of the year."</p></q>
That may be a significant statement. I hope the Minister will now tell us what he has so far ignored, what part of this escalation is accounted for by the rising cost brought about by the Government's own actions? In the Adjournment Debate on 23rd May of this year the Minister said this:
	<br><q><p>"The difference in respect of Ninewells is at least half accounted for by additions to the programme and the inclusion of equipment which was not in the original figure which at Ninewells amounts to £2½ million."—[OFFICIAL REFORT, 23rd May, 1969; Vol. 784, 	<i>c.</i> 837.]</p></q>
I must ask the Minister what about the other £3 million? What happened to that, some part of which must be accounted for by additions? But if we take equipment and that together the Minister says that these account for rather more than half the increase. If we are generous in our estimate of what "rather more than half" means there is still a missing £2 million. What happened to that £3 million and how does the Minister account for that part of the escalation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must remind the Minister that yesterday Selective Employment Tax was increased yet again. This 28 per cent. in-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>142</span>
crease will add £5 million to building costs in Scotland, which means that it is running at £25 million a year. How much of this £25 million is falling on the hospital building programme? Has the Minister made any estimate, or did the increase catch him unawares, just as the original introduction of this crazy tax in 1966 made nonsense of the Scottish Plan of January, 1966? I hope the builders will join the retailers of Scotland who have been writing letters—and very good letters—to Members of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the Treasury which gives these constant fillips to escalating costs, encouraged by the masochistic applause of the Secretary of State and the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Dewar). Apart from S.E.T., we have suffered the impact of devaluation, and the hospitals are as much exposed as the housewife is to the constant and sharp rise in costs during the present Government's term of office.

I turn to the question of reorganisation, and the Green Paper published last December, six months after our health debate in this Committee, when reorganisation was the main theme. Rightly, it has figured largely again today. I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for his statement, which we have been asking for. A few days ago he told us the names of the 128 organisations which had submitted written comments. But when will he reach a decision? We know that the Government are awaiting the Report of the Royal Commission on Local Government. A year ago in our debate the Minister who is to reply today said that
	<br><q><p>"… we have in mind that the Royal Commission on Local Government will be reporting later this year."—[OFFICIAL REFORT, 	<i>Scottish Grand Committee,</i> 9Ch July, 1968; c. 18.]</p></q>
But later this year came and went with no report. Now, a year later, we ask the Minister again when the report will be published. It will be helpful if for once we can have an accurate reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lawson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How much time is the hon. Gentleman going to give my hon. Friend to reply?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Last year we referred to the twentieth anniversary of the Health Service. Now we have reached the twenty-first anniver-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0285">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>143</span>
sary, which remains, if only for a short time, the more significant celebration. It is right, therefore, that we should thank all those in this great Service for the selfless work they do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been asked a large number of questions and cannot possibly answer them all, but I shall try to answer at least a number of them in the rather limited time available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was rather disappointed that there was little discussion about the Green Paper this morning. It would have been useful to have the whole morning devoted to it, because we are here dealing with something which will ultimately have implications for the development of the Service over a considerable period. In any case, all that I would have been able to do would have been to listen to comments from hon. Members, because it would be wrong for me to anticipate any Government decisions on these matters when we are still considering the representations made to us by the various bodies directly involved in the Health Service. But we are open to suggestions and ideas from any source, and are still willing to welcome any ideas coming to us on the reorganisation of the Service. I have taken note of what has been said this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is in this Committee, as elsewhere, a general feeling that the tripartite structure no longer meets the needs of the Service, and a general acceptance of the idea of a unitary structure, whether on a single- or two-tier basis. How exactly the areas should be delineated and how exactly the area health boards, if that is what we have, should be made up, are questions that are still open, and I can only repeat that I have an open mind on at least most of them. We shall have to wait in particular for the Wheatley Commission Report to find out what is likely to be involved for local authority services. The fact that the Commission has not yet reported is no responsibility of mine. Like any other Royal Commission, it determines its own procedure and publication date. The fact that the Report is coming rather later than we had expected some time ago is a matter over which the Government have no control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to a point made by both the hon. Member for Galloway (Mr. Brewis) in his interesting opening speech and the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>144</span>
hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) about the figures of nursing staff. The hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire was very selective in the figures he quoted, presumably from the table on page 44 of the 1968 Report. Apart from one, no doubt inadvertent, inaccuracy, which he will see on reading his speech, he quoted only the figures which seemed to suggest that there had been a reduction in the number of nurses employed in the National Health Service. Nothing could be further from the truth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Full-time registered nurses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If one takes the 1964 figures, for example, the whole-time staff has increased from 22,142 to 25,399 at September, 1968. The part-time staff has increased in the same period from 7,781 to 11,191. There are also increases in midwifery staff. It is true that the balance of recruitment has to some extent tilted towards the enrolled rather than the registered nurse, but there is nothing unexpected about this and nothing that causes us particular concern. It was expected that the number of nurses training for the Roll would increase substantially, and to a limited extent this has been at the expense of the number of nurses training for the Register. Pupil nurses in training between 1964 and 1968 have increased by about 150 per cent., and the number of enrolled nurses in the Service between 1964 and 1968 has nearly doubled. I could quote similar figures for the part-time staff. What I want to get on record is that the picture the hon. Gentleman drew was positively misleading about the number of nurses in the National Health Service at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is also, unfortunately, true about the statistics quoted about the hospital building programme. A great deal was said this morning about a cutback in the programme. I say again what I have said on other occasions, that there has been no cutback in the programme. I mean that not only in a money sense but in a real sense, because the programme laid out in 1966 in the review of the hospital plan has been updated to take account of increases in costs since then. The programme is being maintained in real terms, which answers a number of points this morning about the effect of increased costs. There is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0286">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>145</span>
no question of increased costs being paid for from the same programme in money terms. The programme is increased to take account of any inflationary tendencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of particular projects have been quoted. Ninewells is continually quoted; it was quoted by the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire as well as others. But it is not typical of other hospital building in Scotland, because it is a completely new major teaching hospital, the first to be built for a long time, and a project of unequalled complexity. If I am to have these continual criticisms about the Ninewells project, I shall have to point out that if there was something grossly wrong with the original tender that is nothing to do with the present Government, because the original tender was in 1963, and it is the responsibility of hon. Members opposite. The hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire suggested that when the original tender was drawn up we should have known that there would be equipment costs—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: —and that they should have been included. They were not included in the original tender, but I give our predecessors sufficient gumption to realise that they could not put up simply the shell of the building and not put any kind of medical equipment in it. No less than £2.4 million is accounted for by that item alone. In any case, if the tender was wrong in 1963 the criticism must rest with hon. Members opposite.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have obviously been a number of other increases at Ninewells. It is a project that goes back long before 1963. The architect was appointed as far back as 1955, and any difficulty about architects, contractors and so on, largely arises from decisions taken before October, 1964. The project goes back a long way, and obviously there have been increased costs in the interim. Obviously, with a tender accepted at 1963 prices—at one point it was 1961 prices, but the tender was at 1963 prices—there have been considerable increases in costs since, and other items have been added, such as a radiotherapy unit costing about £500,000. There have been a number of other items involved in the increase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same is true of some of the other projects mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason I was slightly irritated
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>146</span>
about this is that I had explained it in the Adjournment Debate on 23rd May this year. The hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger), who makes a great show of being terribly reasonable about anything, but, in my view, is one of the most unreasonable Members of the Committee, said that he read the OFFICIAL REPORT of the debate of 23rd May. If he did, he would also have read that I explained that the way in which the Estimates were presented did not in my view give a sufficiently accurate account of how increases in costs had arisen. I said that if I could make the presentation of the estimates a good deal clearer next year I hoped to do so. But the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Gordon Campbell), who unfortunately is not here now, asked me then whether, if he put down Questions about the projects mentioned again this morning, I would provide him with the detailed explanation of how the figures had increased. I promised to do that, but unfortunately he never put down the Questions. I do not know why, but there is no point in asking these questions and being promised answers and returning as if nothing had ever been said about the costs, because the explanations are largely those I have already given this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards health centres, I note what my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Hannan) said about the Glasgow position. I would not by any means accept all the criticisms he mentioned. The difficulties there are largely the difficulties of obtaining the sites for the health centres, which are mostly in development areas. There are considerable difficulties for the Corporation to give sites which it knows will definitely fit in with the rest of the development projected for the areas concerned. My right hon. Friend has this morning given details of the progress now being made in Glasgow and I hope to see it going ahead fairly quickly there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was rather alarmed to hear some of the descriptions of surgery premises this morning. Executive Councils have a responsibility for seeing that surgery premises are adequate. A doctor who does not provide adequate surgery premises, or who provides unhygienic premises and so on, is technically in breach of his terms of service with the Executive Council. Such premises should be reported to the Executive Council for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0287">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>147</span>
action. There can only be a small number of such cases, and I appreciate that in some of them the doctors concerned are in development areas where the building is coming down and there are particular difficulties. But if these conditions exist there is no excuse for some of the points made this morning, and they should be considered by the Executive Councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked a number of other points which I shall not be able to answer this morning because of the limited time, but perhaps I could just say that the situation in Scotland as regards abortion is, we think, satisfactory. My right hon. Friend mentioned that there is no migration between one area and another, which at least indirectly answers the point of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Wright). There is no large and booming private sector. There are no abortion clinics which are simply abortion clinics. There is none of the problems we have seen highlighted in recent Press stories as being largely related to the situation
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>148</span>
in London. I hope that these developments will not happen in Scotland, but my right hon. Friend has already given a progress report on the situation there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill raised the question of maternity services in Glasgow. The situation there has considerably improved in recent years, and when the new unit is opened at the Southern General Hospital later this year there will be a further improvement. By and large, if the situation is not completely satisfactory, it is reasonably satisfactory in the Glasgow area, and in many other parts of Scotland it is very satisfactory.
