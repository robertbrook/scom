	<p>[Miss HARVIE ANDERSON in the Chair]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>ELECTRICITY (SCOTLAND) BILL</h1></div>
	<p>10.32 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That if the proceedings on the Electricity (Scotland) Bill are not completed at this day's Sitting, the Committee do meet on Thursday at half-past Ten o'clock.—[	<i>Dr. Dickson Mabon.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Dr. J. Dickson Mabon)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee have considered the Electricity (Scotland) Bill in relation to the principle of the Bill.</p></blockquote>
The main purpose of the Bill is simple: it is to raise the limit on the amount which the Scottish Electricity Boards may borrow, from £580 million to £800 million. It is, I think, a truism to say that future economic growth in Scotland depends on the expansion of our power resources. The generation of electricity is universally recognised as a vital prerequisite of industrial expansion and the improvement of living standards. No one is likely to argue, either, against the necessity of long-term planning of electricity needs on a national Scottish basis. Many of the new industries now moving into Scotland will require greatly increased capacity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Electricity demand in Scotland has been accelerating at a higher rate than in England and Wales. During the past ten years the Scottish demand has shown an annual growth rate of about 8½ cent. Sales of electricity are expected almost to double during the seven years up to 1975. This reflects the underlying buoyancy in the Scottish economy. The lion's share of the expenditure is needed for new generating capacity. So although the sums involved are large, so are the operations they are required to finance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Electricity is now available to almost everyone in the south of Scotland and to 96 per cent. in the north. On average, Scottish electricity consumers pay less for their electricity than consumers in England and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
With power stations taking five to seven years to design and build, correct load forecasting is essential. The Scottish Boards have had a very good record in this respect, but correct load forecasting is not enough. It is also essential that the right decision as to size and type of station should be made, so that the system as a whole will be reinforced in the most efficient way, having regard to the characteristics of the expected load and its geographical distribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before going on to elaborate on our requirements may I briefly describe the process of decision-making. Each spring the Boards submit investment programmes for five years ahead. These are subject to a very searching inter-Departmental examination in the light of which the Secretary of State approves programmes for the forthcoming year. The amounts which then have to be borrowed for the investment programmes are closely controlled by the Scottish Development Department and the Treasury in accordance with statutory requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Investment appraisal is carried out in accordance with the principles set out in the White Paper Cmnd. 3437, using the Test Discount Rate recommended by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Planning of new generating capacity for' Scotland as a whole is undertaken by a Joint Planning Committee of the two Boards. All possible methods of meeting future increases in demand are considered. A careful study is made of the various "mixes" of plant which might be suitable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At this crucial stage a computer is employed to simulate the working of the system taking each of the most suitable alternatives in turn. The total system costs are then calculated for each alternative for each year, discounted to the base year and compared with each other. This gives the Planning Committee a clear picture of the effect on Scottish system costs of each alternative, with all other stations fitting into their proper place in the system and adopting the most appropriate load factor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new power stations now being built in Scotland are visible proof of an intensive programme of investment. A large slice of the borrowing authorised

	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
by the Bill will be required for the completion of two large projects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At Longannet Point in south-west Fife the giant new coal burning station of the South Board is rapidly taking shape. This plant, with an eventual capacity of 2,304 megawatts, will be fuelled directly by the Fife coalfields. It will generate its first capacity next year and will work up to full output by 1971. It will operate at high thermal efficiency and will use up to 5 million tons of coal a year after 1971 and provide employment for up to 10,000 miners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting to note the value of the project to the construction and engineering industries. The value of contracts placed is £90 million, of which Scotland's share amounts to well over half.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another sidelight is that the older Kincardine Power Station near Longannet reached, last year, the highest thermal efficiency of any coal burning station in Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other side of the country, work is in progress on Hunterston B, which will add 1,250 megawatts to the South Board's capacity by 1973. This new station, incorporating the latest improvements in world nuclear research, will produce almost four times as much electricity as Hunterston A. The work force on this project will build up to 2,000,
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the Boards are already considering needs in the years after these two great stations have been commissioned. With a continuing increase in demand to be met, both the North and South Boards are planning additional stations in the mid and late 1970s.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first instalment proposed is a 300 megawatt pumped storage scheme at Foyers. After that the Boards see the need for a further large station in the west of Scotland where the heaviest demand is concentrated. The proposal for Foyers is particularly interesting in the silver jubilee year of the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board. It was at Foyers, after all, in 1896, that Lord Kelvin built the first major hydroelectric station in Britain. The tragedy of the Highlands is that so few further stations were pioneered in the next half century. Between 1921 and 1941 six major Highland power schemes were rejected by Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
It was, of course, our late beloved Tom Johnston who was largely instrumental in passing the famous Hydro-Electric Development Act, 1943. This was not only an Act of Parliament; it was an Act of faith which was, for a small country, as dramatic as the establishment of the Tennessee Valley Authority ten years earlier in the United States. I doubt if the present "take off" of the Highlands under the Highlands and Islands Development Board could have happened but for the work of the Board, which has brought electricity to 96 per cent. of the Highlands and helped provide the infrastructure for modern industry in modern communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the last 25 years technological breakthroughs have pioneered new forms of power. The proposal is that the Foyers scheme, like the successful new station at Cruachan, would use off-peak electricity at time of low demand to pump water uphill from a low level to a high level reservoir and generate its own electricity at peak periods by running the water down again. Schemes of this kind provide a means of storing electricity and, in effect, allow us to get more intensive use out of thermal or nuclear plants already installed elsewhere. In other words, Foyers would cause more coal to be burnt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Less dramatically, the work has continued of bringing electricity to remote islands, of serving a North Board area which covers a quarter of the land mass of Britain. Extensions are in progress in the Shetland Islands, the Outer Hebrides and in several of the remoter mainland areas. The Board has in operation 76 miles of submarine cable serving 23 islands, apart from islands which generate their own power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me turn to the financial criteria. The extent to which money has to be borrowed to meet the capital requirements is dependent, not only on the scale of investment, but also on the financial performance of the Boards. Let me repeat that, on average, Scottish electricity consumers as a whole pay less for their electricity than consumers in England and Wales. If that position is to be maintained without excessive borrowing, considerable efforts will be necessary to keep down costs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Prices are important in many ways, but they depend on techniques and efforts which the Boards must make to keep down costs, and therefore prices. The industry in Scotland pioneered in Great Britain the off-peak use of electricity, and this is to a large extent the reason why we have this marginal difference in prices. This has had a material effect on daily and weekly demand curves—that is to say, the off-peak use of electricity—and has produced considerable benefit in reducing both investment in new capacity and running costs. The
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0012">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
scope for further off-peak development is becoming more limited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Boards are now concentrating on the improvement of productivity and efficiency. They are already able to report significant savings as a result of their efforts. The South Board was singled out by the National Board for Prices and Incomes for its work in introducing and developing yardsticks for the assessment of individual performance. Work studies and incentive payment schemes have been introduced, and computers are being employed to an increasing extent. The services of management consultants have been used where appropriate. This is viewed by the Boards as a continuing process which is expected to increase the productivity of labour, measured in terms of units sold, by about 40 per cent. in the next four years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come, now, to another important provision in the Bill, and hon. Members may be interested in this, although at first sight it seems small. I am referring to the change proposed in the statutory requirements governing the authentication of the Boards' seals. I shall return to other general matters when I have dealt with this. At present two signatures are required, that of the Chairman or another authorised member of the Board, and that of the secretary or another authorised person. It is proposed in future to require only the signature of the secretary or other authorised person. With an organisation of the size of these Boards, and bearing in mind the many transactions which will require sealing, hon. Members will readily appreciate that the requirement of a signature by a Board member as well as that of an official of a Board can be unnecessarily restrictive. I understand from the Boards that it has in fact become unduly burdensome. Care must be taken in relaxing protective requirements of this nature, but what we have proposed is in line with modern practice, and was accepted by Parliament in recent legislation governing the Transport Boards and the Air Corporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The estimates on which the proposed new limit in the Bill is based are explained in the White Paper on the Bill in the Boards' brochure "Plans for the future, 1968–1975", copies of which are
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
available to hon. Members, but it might be helpful if I explain the position briefly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last occasion on which the House considered the borrowing powers of the Scottish Electricity Boards was the debate on the Electricity (Borrowing Powers) (Scotland) Order, 1966, which raised the borrowing limit of the Scottish Boards from £500 million to £580 million. The hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Gordon Campbell) will remember that I said then that the £580 million was expected to last till March, 1969, and that this would give the House an opportunity of reviewing the position within about two years. This estimate has proved to be very near the mark. It is two years since we debated that Order. At 31st March, 1969, the total borrowings to count against the limit are expected to be £583 million, and this debate is taking place almost precisely two years after we gave the figures in the Borrowing Order debate, saying that we would get pretty well near that figure by the spring of 1969.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new limit of £800 million is expected to last till 1975, but the Bill provides an interim limit of £700 million beyond which the Boards will not have power to borrow unless the Secretary of State for Scotland, as two years ago, makes an order which must receive the approval of the House of Commons. The House will, therefore, have an opportunity to consider the Boards' activities before the limit of £700 million can be passed. The estimate is that that point is likely to be reached in 1972.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper on the Bill shows, in paragraph 8, that at 31st March, 1968, total borrowings had reached £542 million, and estimates the further capital requirements of the Scottish Electricity Boards by 31st March, 1975, at £506 million. The allocation of this estimate between the two Boards and its detailed make-up between generation, transmission, and distribution expenditure and working capital are again set out in Table 3 of the Boards' brochure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of the total requirement of £506 million, the Boards expect to meet £300 million from internal resources, leaving the balance of £206 million to come from borrowing. This is the extent of the new borrowing envisaged, but, in addition, provision has been included for about
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0013">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
£37 million of re-borrowing to repay loans which are at present outside the borrowing limit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. J. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will give us some indication of the Government's expectations for the future of the extrapolation of the Table in paragraph 2 of the Memorandum to the White Paper which shows the breakdown of borrowings to date between stock issues, Government advances, and temporary borrowings.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will remember the Radcliffe Committee, and its recommendations. He will recall, too, the consequential steps taken by his Government, for which I do not blame them, with regard to the future method of financing the Boards' operations. I shall be happy to comment on this matter at the end of the debate if the hon. Gentleman will permit me, or perhaps intervene in his speech if he has an opportunity of catching your eye, Miss Harvie Anderson. I shall then be in a position to supply more figures. The hon. Gentleman will probably want to refresh his memory on Radcliffe, and indeed on what happened as a consequence in the White Paper which the party opposite published towards the end of the 1959-64 Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend the Bill to the Committee as a Measure which is essential both for the electricity supply industry in Scotland and for the public, and I think that this is the industry which Scotland deserves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have listened with interest to what the Minister has had to say on the Bill, which is one of a series which seems to come up every two or three years in the Scottish Committee for us to consider how much money is needed for electricity development in Scotland. I do not think that it is altogether irrelevant to ask, and I did not understand from the Minister's speech, why the borrowing which was anticipated at a peak of £580 million in 1963, which was going to last till 1970, has had to be so steeply increased at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister, and anybody who has studied the matter, knows, the problem is that it is exceedingly difficult to forecast with accuracy the growth of demand
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
in the electricity industry, and, having made one's guess about that, to forecast, a number of years ahead, exactly what type of station will be most useful, and what it will cost by the time it is on the ground. All these difficulties are accepted, but I think it is useful for Parliament if, when Ministers bring forward Bills of this sort, they have a fairly clear idea of where the earlier estimates have gone wrong, and I hope that in his winding up speech the Minister will be able to say something about this, because we have been given a number of different reasons for this by different sections of the industry, or by Ministers, and I think it would be useful to know the truth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Boards have been saying that the reason why so much extra money is needed is their running costs have increased sharply and this has had an effect on their profits, and, therefore, they are not able to provide as much from their internal resources as they had planned to do. This may be part of the reason, but, if one looks at the averages which were forecast in the 1963 White Paper, one finds that the figures come out rather surprisingly different from that general picture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On average the internal borrowing to date would have been £182 million, whereas the actual borrowing from internal resources has been £164 million—lower, it is true, but not very significantly lower; and yet the borrowing from outside, which on average by this date should have been £345 million, has increased to £433 million. I do not know the answer. I am asking the Minister for it. It would appear that the internal resources due to higher running costs are not the nigger in this woodpile, but something outside. If that is so, we should be told why costs have risen, outside the possibility of what the Boards could provide from their own internal finances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that over the last ten years the growth rate of electricity in Scotland had been 8½ per cent. on average. If one looks at this admirable short paper which the Boards have given us to study—it is a short paper, and there are a good many questions in it which are not answered—it is clear that in the last two years, in 1968 and 1967, the growth rates respectively were 6·4 and 4·2, and the estimate for 1969, next
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0014">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
year, is only 7·2, which is very considerably below the 10-year average, and below anything that is given in this paper. Perhaps this is one reason why the Boards are having to ask for extra money. Perhaps it is because the growth of electricity has been well below what was planned, and this is part of the stagnant economy problem which has affected the whole country, though Scotland, perhaps, to some extent less than England—not greatly, because on the Digest of Scottish Statistics the total output remained at 129 for three years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archie Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Paragraph 7 of the memorandum says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Certain compensation stock and borrowings which are excluded by statute from the aggregate borrowings to be set against the limit will fall to be repaid before 31st March, 1957, and the borrowing which will be necessary to make these repayments will not be excluded from the limit."</p></blockquote>
A proportion of that limit will be used for loan borrowings which took place a number of years ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the point made by the hon. Gentleman refers to the £37 million in Table 3, and is not taken into consideration in the point that I am making, because my figures are exclusive of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not clear in this White Paper, or from the Minister's speech, or from anything else that I have seen, exactly what factors have been increasing so sharply in price, or which side of revenue has been decreasing so sharply that this considerable extra borrowing is necessary now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one factor which is quite clearly part of the trouble, though I suspect that it is not a large part of it, and that is the effect of the cost of borrowing. We cheerfully agreed that they should be allowed to borrow what seemed to each of us enormous sums, but the cost of borrowing in 1963 was 5⅜ per cent. and in 1968 it is 7⅜ per cent.—an extra 2 per cent. This is very considerable when we are talking in terms of £500 or £600 million, which are the sorts of sums which will be borrowed in 1975. Therefore, we hope, although without any great reason for hoping, that borrowing rates will decrease sharply both for our sakes and for the Electricity Boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
One factor which the Committee must bear in mind, although it is difficult to know how best to assess it, is what impact North Sea gas will have on electricity generation in Scotland. This is a major factor which is almost literally in the air at the moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hardly in the air.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has been confined in the last 24 hours, if the Minister wishes to be accurate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State has, I believe, succeeded in maintaining the principle that North Sea gas arrives and is sold in Scotland at the same price as in other parts of the country. One hopes that gas or oil will be found off the Scottish coast. If it is, it probably will not come in time for ordinary consumption in 1975. But the possibility of the arrival of North Sea gas will have a very considerable effect soon after 1975 on which electricity stations should be built, how electricity should be generated and the pricing of many of our fuel policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I notice this statement on page 4 of of "Plans for the Future" from the Scottish Electricity Boards:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is also emerging a downward trend in the marginal cost of generating electricity and this should enable the Boards to continue to sell at prices which compare favourably with other fuels".</p></blockquote>
It may well be that there is
	<br><blockquote><p>"a downward trend in the marginal cost of generating electricity",</p></blockquote>
although the phrase is carefully hedged round. If that is so, it is slightly startling to many consumers in Scotland that here is clearly a sharp upward trend in prices. This is perhaps even more worrying to those of us who live within the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share with the Minister and many hon. Members an enormous appreciation of Tom Johnston. I knew him extremely well. The first hydroelectric scheme was built on my farm—and I got to know him even better. I was one of the very few people in the farming, landed communities of Scotland who backed the Board from the very beginning and tried to get it to develop its schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the Sloy Scheme is just on 20 years old. We were all told in the Highlands that there was a great advantage in hydroelectric schemes because they cost a great deal initially to put in but
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0015">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
that, once in, the costs rapidly came down and that great benefit would result. As I say, it is about 20 years since the Sloy power station was completed. As I remember it, the power stations were to be written off fairly quickly. Therefore, I think that almost the whole of the Sloy power station must now be completely written off and that other schemes which followed it will be in the same position. But, in spite of this, the cost of electricity in the north of Scotland goes up quite steadily. Instead of, after depreciation is written off, the cost coming down, the reverse is happening. What we were told by Tom Johnston, Edward MacColl, Tom Lawrie and many other great pioneers of the Hydro-Electric Board does not seem to be happening in our homes and businesses and in other places in the Highlands. I accept what the Minister said, namely, that if the Hydro-Electric Board had not done the work the Highland Development Board would have been hamstrung.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the problem of new stations. The Minister told us how the computer worked out exactly what would happen, and apparently everybody now believes it. From an Answer to a Question asked in the House on 26th June this year, it was perfectly clear that nuclear generation was the cheapest per unit, including depreciation and interest on capital. Therefore, I find it odd that the computer has apparently come up with the answer that in 1976–77 the Boards should build one or two oil-fired stations. The computer may have had some knowledge which was not given to the House on 26th June, but it seems a little odd that if nuclear power is the cheapest we should be going back to oil-fired power in another eight or nine years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alex Eadie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman's statement should be challenged. If he reads the Report of the Select Committee on Science and Technology, he will see a lot of evidence in support of the belief that nuclear energy is cheaper. He asked for an independent inquiry into this matter. Therefore, what he raises is an open question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely accept from the hon.

hon. Gentleman would not wish me to denigrate the careful replies given by his own Ministers, although he may disagree with them. But they represent the best information which we on this side can have, and we can hardly be blamed for quoting figures which his own Minister gave. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I apologise if the Minister of State thinks that I should not defend his colleagues, but I am doing my best.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I move to something which caused me a little worry and which appears in the last sentence on page 5 of this document:
	<br><blockquote><p>"To safeguard the future it is planned to provide, so far as possible, a plant margin designed to afford the same measure of security as that adopted for England and Wales."</p></blockquote>
We in Scotland have, on the whole, been enormously more successful than England and Wales in both anticipating and meeting our own electricity needs. I am a little worried that, judging from the way in which this is phrased, it looks as though we are coming to something which has been understood and done in England and Wales for a number of years. The reverse is true. I hope that we are not reversing our margin of safeguards to meet their requirements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to the question of future plans and generation, may I ask the Minister where the new Dounreay fast breeder prototype reactor fits in? According to the document which we have, the North Board is producing Foyers in 1974 but nothing else, and the South Board is producing Longannet and Hunterston and nothing else. Dounreay, which we decided to go ahead with, does not appear in either the North Board or the South Board. That is a little odd, because Dounreay is a fairly important producer of electricity in the north of Scotland. Clearly, it will arrive fairly soon, because we learn, a little later on in the same pamphlet, that the transmission lines have to be completed up to there by 1970. Therefore, we shall have the transmission lines but, for some reason, the station has been omitted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Presumably the electricity which it generates is used in various places, probably in the north. Therefore, it has some bearing on future plans and perhaps should have been mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would the Minister say a word or two more about the smelter which is coming to Invergordon? I do not believe that there is an hon. Member who is not thoroughly delighted about the coming of the new smelter to the north, but let us try to get some clear answers about the Government's policy for the sake of people who live in the north and for industries which might want to settle there. I do not object to the idea of supplying low-price electricity to an industry in a growth centre. There are people who can argue about this matter for a long time. I will not enter into that argument. I do not disagree with it as long as we know exactly what the subsidy is. If other industries, perhaps big users of electricity, want to settle in the north of Scotland area or, for that matter, in the south-west and need large quanities of electricity cheaply, will the Government's policy be to treat them in the same way as the smelter at Invergordon?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister checks up on the cost of industrial electricity in Scotland, I suspect that he will find—and certainly this was the case three or four years ago when I was considering the matter with some care—that in Scotland it was impossible to give or to get the same quotation for electricity for big users as was available, not in every part of Britain, but in many of the English Border areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of our main problems was that industries could not be attracted to Scotland because the cost of industrial electricity was relatively higher than it was elsewhere. We should be told whether the Government intend to subsidise industry by using electricity as a bait and, if so, how it will be subsidised,
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
because there will be a lot of feeling in the Highlands if, as I suspect, the cost of electricity continues to rise and people believe that they are paying for a smelter at Invergordon through the rates for their domestic consumption. The Minister should give us some information about that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I notice that the North of Scotland Board is to spend a considerable sum on distribution over the next five or six years. The Minister said that 96 per cent. of the population in the North Board's area were now connected. That is true. The figure has gone up 3 per cent. in the last four years. The last few percentage increases are always the hardest to achieve. But, having said that, it is fair to point out that the people who are still not connected have a sense of grievance far greater than people did ten or fifteen years ago when many people were in the same boat. There are people in my constituency without electricity, although not many parts of Argyll remain unconnected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have with me a letter from a constituent in Strontian who says that in April the Board promised that electricity would be supplied to him by the end of this year. His premises still remain unconnected and he writes, pathetically,
	<br><blockquote><p>"Did they mean 1969 and not 1968?"</p></blockquote>
If money is to be spent on distribution, I hope that the Hydro-Electric Board will remember that while nobody expects it to connect up at this stage the extremely distant single farm which is alone in a glen, the supply of electricity along main roads in peninsulars is of enormous benefit and helps to keep the population in an area. I appreciate that making these connections is expensive and that the Board is unlikely to make much money as soon as connections are made, but Scotland will lose a great many people unnecessarily if this work is not done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is clearly necessary, because the Government must ask for extra borrowing powers. I had hoped that they would not be so large, but I suspect, because the budget is narrow, that even if all goes well there will still be only about £15 million to spare, so that perhaps the calculations will be wrong again, as they have been over the period 1963
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0017">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
to 1968, and that we will have another Bill seeking more money. I hope that the Minister will answer the general but important questions I have asked.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lawson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to have this opportunity to debate the electricity industry at this time. It is far too seldom that we have an opportunity to consider the functioning of the nationalised industries, and especially the electricity industry in Scotland. An industry such as this labours under many disabilities which do not face other industries. When we seek to show how well or how badly it is doing, we should bear these disabilities in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) referred to the 4 per cent. of people in Scotland still without electricity. He will be aware that the smaller the remaining percentage of people unconnected, the more expensive becomes the industry's task of connecting them up to the electricity supply. The majority of this 4 per cent. are probably in remote parts of the country, and the cost of bringing electricity to them must be great. What is it now costing to take electricity to remote areas? I trust that hon. Gentlemen opposite are aware that, if this industry were not nationalised, these people would have no hope of getting electricity. It is odd to think that many of those who are crying out for electricity to be connected to their homes or farms are the same people who oppose nationalisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman wondered why the industry wanted more borrowing powers. If he reads the Annual Report of the South of Scotland Electricity Board he might find the answer, for on page 12 we read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"At 31st March, 1968, expenditure on assets not in use amounted to at least £98 million, on which annual interest alone amounts to more than £5 million."</p></blockquote>
In other words, a huge, costly generating station, which yields no profit for some years, must come into the accounts. That is a reason—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course it is a reason, it must have been taken into account in the original plans.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lawson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will come to that. The fact that the industy carries so much capital which is earning nothing but
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
which requires great expenditure to service means that money is tied up, and this is one of the disabilities which must be borne in mind. I can imagine what the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) would say if we were talking about a private industry. In this case we are discussing an industry which is operating largely for social purposes. Hon. Gentlemen opposite should not make adverse criticism which is completely biased and misleading. This industry does not get the capital grants which go to other concerns, such as the smelter being built at Invergordon. It would be interesting to know how much public money will go to the building of this smelter and to the running of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member must be as aware, as are other hon. Members and the Chair, that we are discussing a very narrow Bill. He is testing the Chair a little far in his comments now. Perhaps he will direct his mind to the Bill and not go out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lawson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You will be aware, Miss Harvey Anderson, that the right hon. Member for Argyll spoke about the smelter and asked the Minister a number of questions about it. If it is right for him to raise the matter, I trust that it is right for me to do the same. I am concerned to see that the consumer of electricity—and the industry—is not obliged to carry part of this cost, in addition to the burdens which must be born already. If there are hidden costs going into the smelter which are subsequently to be carried by other sections of industry—for example, by the electricity industry—this is relevant to our debate. If subsidies are paid, they should be open subsidies which do not come out of such industries as electricity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member appears to have missed the point I was making. The question by the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) was on a different aspect of the subject. The hon. Member for Motherwell (Mr. Law-son) is now extending the field of discussion beyond what it is competent to do on this Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. If we are discussing the need to extend borrowing powers to the limits laid down in the Bill, would you not agree that it is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0018">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
necessary for us to look at the liabilities and loan charges and prices and try to draw proper conclusions from them? This is what I thought my hon. Friend the Member for Motherwell (Mr. Lawson) was doing. He is being ruled out of order for drawing a comparison between private enterprise firms which get help and the liabilities of such public concerns as, for example, the electricity authority in his area and the North of Scotland Board. He is showing that these concerns carry a greater burden than private enterprise firms, with the result that more borrowing is necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clearly the thoughts of the hon. Member and mine on this occasion are not as one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lawson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not pursue the matter. Enough has been said to show that we are concerned with consumer interests. I want the Minister to assure us that the consumer of electricity in Scotland will not carry the extra cost of the smelter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the right hon. Member for Argyll spoke of costs going up and up, one cannot consider the matter without making comparisons. The South of Scotland Electricity Board stated on page 11 of its Annual Report that the average remuneration of its employees had gone up by 93·4 per cent. between 1956 and 1967-68. These are suitable comparisons to make when talking about prices. The delivered price of fuel—this is largely in respect of coal, although it includes nuclear fuel—went up by 29·4 per cent., the average interest rate on borrowing went up by 49·5 per cent., the average price of electricity went up by 17·8 per cent., the retail price index went up by 38·6 per cent., and the units of electricity sold per employee went up by 83 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These facts revealed by the South of Scotland Electricity Board—and no doubt many of these factors could be applied to the Hydro-Electric Board—show that from 1956 to the latest available date the price of electricity went up by less than half the average retail price, while productivity—about which we hear so much these days—per unit per man employed nearly doubled. This is a remarkable tribute to the industry. People
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
like the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart are so concerned with the costs which industrialists must meet that they overlook these facts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not been able to compare the cost of electricity in Scotland with the cost to industrialists in England and Wales, but if we are to accept the figures of the current number of the 	<i>Digest of Statistics,</i> then in both the north and south of Scotland electricity charges for industrialists are lower than those for the domestic consumer. Has the hon. Member for Cathcart noticed this, or is he concerned only with matters that interest him, even though they do not give a true picture of the position? Here are the figures taken from Table 14 on page 11 of the 	<i>Digest of Statistics.</i> For the domestic consumer the South of Scotland Electricity Board price is 1·644d. per unit, and for the industrial consumer it is 1·615d., a difference of 0·029d., which is not bad when one is talking about industrial consumers. Similarly, for the Hydro-Electric Board area the cost for the domestic consumer is 1·671d. per unit, and for the industrial consumer it is 1·63d., a difference of 0041d. a substantial difference in that area. The commercial consumer pays a bit more, and public lighting pays still more, which might suggest a certain bias against public authorities in this connection. But those are important figures to be borne in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Bruce-Gardyne) constantly talks about manpower and the contraction of employment in Scotland. Here again, the electricity industry shows a remarkable record. Taking only two years, the manpower employed by the South of Scotland Board has contracted by virtually 1,300, from 17,273 to 15,976, a contraction of more than 8 per cent. That is a remarkable development, bearing in mind the substantial increase in generation and sale of electricity, and bearing in mind also the substantial increase in the amount of money paid out in wages and salaries. Over the same period, to that number of employees, the amount paid in wages and salaries rose by £1,110,000, or more than 6 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baxter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. Friend has taken time to consider the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0019">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
amount of work now sub-contracted by the Electricity Boards which they previously did themselves but found it was not to their advantage to do. This in turn would reduce the number of people directly employed by the Electricity Boards but add to the number of people employed by subcontractors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lawson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair point. I have not made the comparison, but I should be interested to see it made. What I can say is that for the smaller number of employees to which I have referred very much more is being generated, so to speak, and, taking costs also into account, the price of electricity has risen less than that for many other elements in our economic life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now, one or two questions. I am a little puzzled about some of the expenditures of, in particular, the Hydro-Electric Board. I note, for example, that the Hydro-Electric Board does a great deal regarding fish conservation. I strongly support the conservation of fish, and I note from Appendix VI, page 53, of the Report of the Hydro-Electric Board that a great deal of activity in this connection is noted—millions of fry planted in different rivers, thousands of yearlings and under-yearlings released into rivers, and so on. River after river is mentioned, and the efforts made to supply these rivers with fish and to conserve the fish must be very great. One wonders what the rivers would be like were it not for the efforts of the Hydro-Electric Board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I see nothing in the accounts—perhaps I missed it—telling us what that work costs. It must cost a substantial amount. Neither do I see anything about returns. If, for example, the right hon. Member for Argyll has a river which benefits from the activities of the Hydro-Electric Board in planting fry and running in yearlings, I should expect the right hon. Gentleman to pay a substantial sum to the Board for that service, and I should expect the same from others of the great Highland lairds and so on. It is an outstanding service, but I find no record of any contribution in return.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baxter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will recall that, when the boards were set up by our predecessors in office, substantial compensation was paid to certain landlords, notably in the north of Scot-
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
land, some of them receiving over £100,000 in compensation for disturbance of fishing rights? This has meant a continuing payment of loan charges as a burden upon the industry now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lawson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is a good businessman and that is a sound point for a businessman to make. Clearly, he is making a contribution in that respect all the time, as we all are. But I am concerned here with a specific service being rendered in the conservation of fish. It must cost a lot of money, but I see no statement in the accounts of cost or of return. I do not object to it, though I might have something to say if I found that it were only costing money and not earning anything.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Margaret Herbison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is making a good point. What would his attitude be if similar help were given from another source to the very worthy small angling associations of Lanarkshire?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lawson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most concerned that that should be done. If you had allowed me to do so, Miss Harvie Anderson, I should have spent a little time showing how an excellent anglers' association keeps the Clyde River fed with fish but cannot get a penny. However, that is out of order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Lanarkshire recently, there has been an excellent new development by the electricity board, and I have no reason to think that the same is not true elsewhere. An excellent consumers' complaint service, to call it that, or public relations service has been developed. I think that this Board is the first in all Britain to set up separate offices in difference parts, with people who are employed solely for dealing with complaints when they come in. Over the past few months, I have been much impressed by the ready response I have had from the electricity authority in my area, and the speed with which it has dealt with any complaint raised. That service also costs money, but it is a service of great benefit to ordinary people. I should like there to be a way of enumerating these achievements and developments when an industry such as this is being criticised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Altogether, I am happy to support the Bill. I hope that, in the time available to us, we shall be able to point out for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0020">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
public notice and for the notice of such as the hon. Members for Cathcart and for South Angus the exceeding great success of the Scottish Electricity Boards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the interests of brevity I shall not follow all the points made by the hon. Member for Motherwell (Mr. Lawson). I shall leave the Minister of State to reply to his interesting speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that we have opportunity to discuss the Scottish electricity industry today. It is right that we should look carefully at the figures, since they represent a huge expenditure of public money and it is important that the Boards should justify the increase in borrowing powers. All hon. Members who have spoken have highlighted the present high interest rate of 7⅜ per cent. This has a significant effect on the financial performance on the Boards, and the sooner it can be reduced the better for all concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right also to take into account the cost of fuels as an important element affecting the Electricity Boards. The 2d. surcharge on oil and the high cost of coal have great significance in this connection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why has the South of Scotland Electricity Board built up such enormous stocks of coal—about 415,000 tons this summer I understand—at a cost of £2·4 million? Again, this expenditure is financed at 7⅜ per cent. Why is it necessary? The Minister knows that I have taken a great interest in the coal industry and support the use of coal as the prime fuel for electricity generation because of the advantage which that gives to the Scottish miners who have been having a difficult time in recent years. Nevertheless, it is right to question the purchasing programme of the Board when it comes to the House asking to borrow large sums of money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Adam Hunter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman agree that, in the light of the dismay and concern in the Scottish mining industry at present, precipitate action could be taken to deprive the power stations of the necessary coal?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but I do not think that that is likely to happen. I have a high regard for our coal miners, and I do not believe that they would suddenly deprive Scotland of its electrical power. I do not think that the situation is quite
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
so serious as the hon. Gentleman suggests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) was right to probe the position regarding natural gas. The estimates are very speculative in relation to Scottish fuel policy, and I hope that the Minister will tell us a little more about it in winding up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One notes from the Report the uncomfortably small margin of capacity at present available. One has in mind the Chapelcross power station run by the Atomic Energy Authority and selling electricity to the South of Scotland Board, and the difficult situation, through one reactor going out of action, which has affected Chapelcross for some time, reducing the amount of power available to the South of Scotland Board. When does the Board expect to receive the full quantity of electricity from Chapelcross again? In this connection, all of us pay tribute to the excellent work done by the technical staff of Chapelcross in overcoming an unexpected difficulty in one of the reactors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will some of the money for which the Board is asking cover the possible electrification of the Carlisle-Glasgow line? Last week, the Minister of Transport said that the decision on whether the line would be electrified had been put off till December, 1969. Has the Board allowed a sum of money for this development? There will need to be developments in Lanarkshire and Dumfriesshire. While the railways will be paying for the electrification over the line, there will be a lot of work to be done by the South of Scotland Electricity Board.

Members will have noted in the Board's Report that there is an Amenity Committee, appointed by the Secretary of State, and comprising half a dozen very distinguished ladies and gentlemen, a number of whom are architects. I have read the Report, but there is not the scrape of a pen about what that Committee has been doing. I would like to know what recommendations it is making. This is an important matter, and my remarks in no way indicate that I want the development of electricity in Scotland to be reduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am all for taking power to remote areas and to industry, but I want us to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0021">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
pause and to ask whether we are doing the right thing in the long term to reduce the unsightliness of transmission lines. Those of us who read in a Sunday magazine about a "world in trouble" will realise how often, in a technological age, we go ahead with projects without realising that we have created a lot of problems. In a five or six acre field not far from me there are something like twenty electricity poles, surrounded by about ten G.P.O. telephone poles round the edge of the field. This is the sort of thing I criticise. At another vantage point not far away, looking over the Solway Firth, I can count something like 110 poles or pylons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the Amenity Committee questioning the Electricity Board sufficiently about underground cables? I know that it is extremely expensive, but further development may bring down the cost. In years to come our children and grandchildren may not thank us for littering Scotland's beautiful countryside with poles and pylons. The Board rightly takes credit for putting up 900 miles of 275 kilowatt super grid. That is 900 miles of misery to some people, with huge poles and pylons over their property, or spoiling the view. I give credit to the Boards and the Atomic Energy Authority for the care and trouble that they take over the design and construction of their power stations, particularly at Hunterston. We expect a very high standard of design at Inverkip. Is the same amount of effort put into the design of pylons which are dotted around? We must not shrug this off. Everywhere we are trying to raise the standards of amenity in Scotland, and we do not want it wrecked by the unnecessary erection of pylons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to pay tribute to the Board's staff, particularly in the rural areas. We have gales, snow and sleet, and in the middle of the night they will come out to repair electricity lines so that farmers can begin milking at 6 o'clock in the morning. I also pay tribute to the staff on the domestic side who deal with complaints. All in all, it is a first-class service. With my strong plea that amenity should be taken more seriously, I support this Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have pleasure in taking part in this debate and in welcoming the Bill, with certain reservations. A great deal of money is being sought to be
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
borrowed, and, according to my hon. Friend most of which will be spent in the South of Scotland Electricity Board area. This is important, as it has been said that almost all of the north has electricity facilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a former miner, who has spent all his previous working life in the mining industry, this Bill is of particular interest to me because my interest and thoughts are always with the industry and those who work in it. I am aware that there are new methods of generating electricity, oil, nuclear energy and now natural gas. As the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) asked, what will happen when natural gas comes along? Experiments are going on in order to generate electricity from natural gas. I want to know what will be the apportionment among these various fuels of the money to be borrowed. Naturally I am interested in coal producing electrical energy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A Bill of this kind shows that the Government have confidence in Scotland's future. Increased electricity means more industrial activity and more jobs, which in turn means a general improvement in the wellbeing of the people in Scotland. I would like to see a great deal more capital expenditure on coal-fired power stations, which have proved themselves, and which, in the future, will be more valuable. As we all know, the cost of production in the mining industry is coming down steadily, and this will release cheap coal for the electrical industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was pleased that my hon. Friend mentioned the Kincardine power station, which is in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton), and adjoins my own constituency. There is also a new power station at Cockenzie.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend also mentioned Longannet power station, which is a huge complex, requiring several mines to be driven. Coal will go straight into the power station yard. It is one of the greatest coal fired stations in the world, it does two things—provides electricity for all, and jobs for miners. In the last ten years we have seen the obliteration of every pit in the central West Fife area. We had 17 or 18 pits closed down in ten years. There was a working population in Fife of a little over 26,000 men. Now we have fewer than 6,000. One
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0022">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
can appreciate how desperately this affects the economy. The Longannet station has been an important economic injection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1962 Report of the Committee on Natural Resources in Scotland shows the plain contradiction between what was supposed to happen and what is now happening. It was estimated then that the output for the next 20 years in Scotland would be between 19 million tons and 20 million tons per annum. The present production figure is very much lower than it was a few years ago, and if this trend continues it will cause great trouble to those in the mining industry. I will not deal with the arguments about the various merits of energy-producing fuels, but to ignore the fact that coal is still the most abundant source of energy in Scotland could be fatal to our economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is great controversy about a national fuel policy. We in the coal mining industry have always understood that, with such a policy, we would get a fair chance among the other energy-producing fuels, but this has not happened. There have been a number of conflicting estimates as to which forms of energy are the most economic. As miners, we contend that everything has not been taken into account when making these estimates. We feel that the exercise is a difficult one, often resulting in forecasts unacceptable to many experts who are able to look objectively at these studies. I hope that my hon. Friend will stress the great part that the coal industry in Scotland can play in the generation of electricity. I welcome the Bill, but I would welcome it even more if he could assure the Committee that more money will be devoted to the coal industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We are led to understand that his views are now of almost dominant importance in discussions in the Cabinet. I can only think that he was forgotten on this occasion.

12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Motherwell (Mr. Lawson) remarked how commendable it was that the price of electricity for the S.S.E.B. had gone up by less than half the retail price index over the past 12 years. This is, in a sense, a commendable fact, but there is bound to be a reverse side of the medal, and that is very much contained in this proposal. In other words, it is partly because prices have not been allowed to rise more steeply that the borrowing requirements of the industry have to be increased.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the right hon. Gentleman is in doubt about that, I refer him to paragraph 3 of the memorandum accompanying the Bill. The Minister of State was a little coy about this. He said it was wonderful that two years ago he said that they were going to need more borrowing powers, and here we are two years from then bang on the nail, absolutely on the clock, and what could be better than that? The Minister elegantly passed over the fact that under the 1963 Act we are a year ahead of what was anticipated. The memorandum makes it clear that this is due mainly to the smaller contribution than was forecast from internal resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why is there this smaller contribution? If we refer to the debate on the Electricity (Borrowing Powers) Order we see the matter very clearly explained both
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0023">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
by the then Minister of Power—like most Ministers of Power in this Government he has moved rapidly to other things; he has not actually fallen off the end of the bench, but no doubt that will come—and by the Minister of State, who made it clear that the reason why the industry was unable to generate sufficient financial resources, and therefore needed additional borrowing powers, was the freeze on prices imposed by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The connection is casual and direct, and we cannot have it both ways. I am not suggesting that hon. Gentlemen opposite wish to have it both ways, but we must recognise that while the relative stability of prices may be commendable in one sense, this factor will seem very uncommendable to Mr. Goode. The Government have to think about him every day of the week. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has to think about him every hour of the day. When he sees that, in this Bill, we are proposing to increase the industry's borrowing limits in this substantial way I hope that he will not start asking embarrassing questions. I hope that he will not read the account of our debate, because if he does I am sure that he will have plenty of embarrassing questions to ask.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman arguing that we ought to have charged more for electricity, to please Mr. Goode?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My answer is that the Government should not have got themselves into the position where they were so dependent on the good will of Mr. Goode, as they are now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not only a question of the total increase in the borrowing limit. It is the extent of the standby which the Government have given themselves which causes me a certain amount of surprise. The fact is that 45 per cent. of the total additional amount is in the standby of £100 million. I should have thought there was a good deal to be said for the Government going back to the House with a fresh Bill before they drew another
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
£100 million, which they can only describe as a standby requirement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are up to £580 million. I said that we would have to come back to the House if we reached £700 million. Is there all that difference between us? If we allow £100 more, that is £680 million, which is only £20 million short of the figure at which we would have to come back to the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The absolute figure in the Bill is £700 million, in addition to which there is £100 million of standby. I am suggesting that it is reasonable for the Government to come back to the House when they have reached the limit of £700 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How do the Government see the breakdown of how these borrowing powers will be used? I notice from Table II that no less than 80 per cent. of the borrowing to date by the Hydro Board and the S.S.E.B. is accounted for by Government advances. In other words, 80 per cent. is accounted for by the printing press. This is going to cause the gravest concern to Mr. Goode.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State referred airily to the Radclifie Committee. This is a matter of dispute, because the Radcliffe Committee dismissed the whole question of money supply as irrelevant, and I think that few people are prepared to accept that now. I must not go further into that, or I shall rapidly be called back to order. I think that we should have some indication of the extent to which the additional borrowing powers will be taken up with Government advances. I hope the Minister will assure us that the extent will be very much less than it has been in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Gas and Electricity Act the industry has been given power to borrow in foreign currency. Will the borrowing powers in this Bill enable the industry to borrow in foreign currency if it requires to do so, or does that come under the blanket power of the Gas and Electricity Act? Are additional powers subsumed by this Bill to enable the industry to borrow in foreign currency? The right to undertake such borrowing has a direct balance of payments consideration, which we are bound to take very seriously at this time.

	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
While we may welcome the possible consequences of passing this Bill for both the industrial and the domestic consumer, and while we may deplore the danger of continuing rapid increases in prices by the nationalised electricity in Scotland, I think we should recognise that it is precisely because of the passage of Bills of this nature that we have Mr. Goode coming to look at the accounts next week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eadie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Bruce-Gardyne) spent a lot of time talking about Mr. Goode. The hon. Gentleman repeatedly makes statements on financial matters, and I notice a letter in 	<i>The Times</i> this morning written by him. One can get very depressed listening to the hon. Gentleman. The hon. Gentleman always writes and speaks about accountancy matters, and he can say that I intend sometimes to shovel coal in my speeches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure we all welcome the fact that there is to be no opposition to the proposition in the Bill. When I intervened in the speech of the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble), who, I thought, was making some rather complacent statements about nuclear power costs, I found his answer even stranger, because he said that he did not want to denigrate statements made by Ministers. But this is exactly what hon. Gentlemen opposite have been trying to do since 1964. If the right hon. Gentleman feels diffident about challenging some of the statements by Ministers, perhaps I might tell him that I can do it for him, because I have challenged many of the statements on fuel policy, and I feel no diffidence about doing that. I find it strange to discover this attitude being adopted by the Opposition, because during the debate on the Queen's Speech one of my hon. Friends likened the Opposition to a car battery, with acid in the stomach, and distilled water at the head. I therefore do not think hon. Gentlemen opposite should feel diffident about this issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to discuss the question of costs in relation to the generating of electricity. Hon. Gentlemen opposite must remember that they bear a heavy responsibility for this whole issue of costs, and for the issue of nuclear power, because they were responsible for introducing the Magnox system of generating power at nuclear
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
power stations. That matter was not only expensive, but cost thousands of miners their jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it rather surprising to hear it said that nuclear power will be cheaper, because when we talk about the A.G.R. system the same things are said about it as were said about the Magnox system in 1956. I think that hon. Members should exercise caution when talking about the bonanza that we shall get in the form of reduced prices for electricity following the great technological advances in the production of nuclear power.

Some mention has been made of investment in other fuels. This is very pertinent to our debate. We should know what part investment in North Sea gas will play in generating electricity. We should examine the big capital investment in North Sea gas. The consumers have been conned in relation to gas. The bonanza which they were supposed to get in cheaper prices has not come to fruition and it will not come to fruition for many years to come, if ever. I doubt whether generating electricity by North Sea gas is a sound way to handle a very important fuel. To use an indigenous fuel in this way is perhaps destroying the chemical industry of the future for our grandchildren.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a challenge in the debate about the availability and price of electricity. I was glad to see in the 	<i>Financial Times</i> something which must be to the credit of the Electricity Board in view of its difficulties. The 	<i>Financial Times</i> said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Evidence of the improving value of electricity in recent years can be seen by comparing the trend of retail prices (up nearly 40 per cent since 1956) with the trend of electricity prices (up 17 per cent.). The Scottish public obviously think so, too, with a per capita electricity usage approaching three times the 1956 level—a remarkable increase in 12 years."</p></blockquote>
I welcome the fact that we are discussing and agreeing to the provision of more capital for the Board because I am conscious of the contribution which it makes to the mining industry in my constituency when there are such modern pits as Monktonhall and Bilston Glen providing fuel for generation at the power stations. If we have a properly planned fuel policy—something very different from the White Paper—we can describe
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0025">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
electricity as being coal by wire and a system providing employment for the mining industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister of State said that the Government are in the process of deciding on siting another power station in the south-west of Scotland. He was probably talking about Inverkip, although he seemed a little coy about mentioning the name. How is it proposed to generate electricity in the new power station? I hope that it will be done, not by oil, but by some indigenous resource like coal. Would my hon. Friend tell us what information he has on this matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. W. H. K. Baker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to limit my remarks to a point raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) about the supply of electricity to the 4 per cent. of the people in the north of Scotland who do not receive it at present. In my constituency, people in the Cabrach area have been waiting for electricity for a considerable time, as the Minister of State well knows because I have been corresponding with him on this subject. This has a distinct bearing on the livelihood of people in the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the major problems in the north of Scotland is depopulation. I understand that last year agriculture as a whole lost 14,000 workers. It is becoming increasingly difficult to retain workers in the more remote areas. Cabrach is a case in point. It is from there that many sheep and calves go down to the lowlands for fattening. If we do not have the necessary manpower on the farms, we shall not have the production which we need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wrote to the Minister fairly recently about this matter, and in his reply he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"At present it is not so much costs which are holding the Board back as the rate at which the necessary capital investment can be authorised."</p></blockquote>
Under the Bill, the money which the Boards will be empowered to borrow will go largely into capital investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The residents in the Cabrach area are as much taxpayers as anybody else in the country. I accept that supplying electricity to this extra 4 per cent. of the population will be costly, but as these people see us passing legislation to enlarge the borrowing powers of the boards, they will rightly say to themselves, "What will we, as taxpayers who have
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
been waiting so long for an electricity supply, get out of it?". This is a very important problem. Unless we are assured that at least some of the extra money will be utilised in greatly reducing the number of people who are without electricity at the moment, my constituents will be very troubled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Doig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am astonished that hon. Members opposite, and particularly the hon. Member for Banff (Mr. W. H. K. Baker) should insist that 4 per cent. of the population who do not receive electricity should be connected up, which the hon. Gentleman admits would be very costly. I am astonished because, over the years, they have been consistently objecting to nationalisation. If there had been no nationalisation of this industry, many people who receive an electricity supply at present would never have done so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Going round the countryside in a baker's van, as I did at one time in my life, I have seen the difference which electricity has made to the lives of people in rural areas. I can recall, when I used to deliver bread to farmworkers' houses, seeing a little lamp flickering, which was all the light that the people had. There was no question of getting a television picture or radio reception at that time. The transformation which has taken place in the rural areas, largely as a result of the activities of the Electricity Boards, has been phenomenal. This applies not only to the North of Scotland Board. The same has happened in the South of Scotland. If the industry had been run by private enterprise, as hon. Members opposite keep preaching, but none has preached today—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We have been fairly strict about keeping to the purpose of the Bill. I would be obliged if the hon. Member would relate his remarks to the purpose of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Banff argued about supplying electricity to another 4 per cent. of the population out of the money borrowed under the Bill. You, Miss Harvie Anderson, allowed the hon. Gentleman to talk about hill sheep. I do not know how they are related to the Bill. I should have thought that that subject was a great deal less relevant than what I am saying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0026">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
The Bill gives extra borrowing powers to a nationalised industry. I am astonished that not one hon. Member opposite has opposed this. The Opposition say that they are opposed to nationalisation and that they are the apostles of free enterprise. Therefore, it is astonishing that not one of them has objected to these extra borrowing powers. Having seen the benefits which past borrowings have brought to the people of Scotland, and particularly people in the remote areas, I hope that the process will continue. I would not object to giving extra borrowing powers to the Board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one point on which I should like clarification. Is my hon. Friend the Minister of State satisfied that we are pursuing a proper policy in relation to the money which is being spent already? While the Government, for reasons which every hon. Member on this side recognise.:, have tended to favour coal-fired stations to a degree which they otherwise would not do—I do not quarrel with that; it is a good thing—I must question the policy which provides for a £24 million plant to be established in Dundee which is then allowed to tick over instead of running at full capacity. This is a modern plant which is top of all the generating stations in Britain when running at full capacity. If the Government want to encourage the use of coal for generating electricity, by all means let them do so by building new coal-fired stations, but, having spent £24 million on an oil-fired plant, let them use it to its full capacity. They are making a mistake in allowing one of the finest plants in Britain merely to tick over.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This has side effects which tend to be ignored. In helping the miners, the Government are hampering other people. In Dundee, the Harbour Trust is losing £24,000 a year because of the go-slow at the oil-fired generating station in Dundee. The river pilots are losing over £1,000 a year in pilotage dues, 88 per cent. of which goes to the pilots directly. They are each losing over £100 a year simply because of this policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is reasonable that the money borrowed under the Bill should be spent on providing a coal-fired generating station, but it is wrong that at the same time a modern oil-fired station in Dundee
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
should be running at well below maximum capacity. Present plants should be running at maximum capacity before money is borrowed to spend on new ones. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister of State will note this point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Doig) has put forward an argument for oil as against coal, which is one of the most fundamental questions which the Minister of State will have to answer. The hon. Members for Midlothian (Mr. Eadie) and Dunfermline Burghs (Mr. Adam Hunter) have spoken eloquently for coal. The fact that the electricity 'board is the largest consumer of coal in Scotland testifies to the campaign which they have carried out on behalf of the coal miners whom they represent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When considering borrowing powers like this, it is time that the Minister indicated the future policy on coal and particularly what will happen to the South of Scotland Electricity Board in the event of the estimates made in relation to Longannet and other stations going wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Annual Report of the South of Scotland Electricity Board for 1967-68 contained a comment in the Consumers' Council seotion, which included the estimate that the additional cost of using coal in coal-fired power stations was £6·2 million per annum. It stated that if every coal-fired station now in use used oil, savings would average £6·2 million annually for six years. The Board also indicated that the differential in coal price, comparing Scotland with England and Wales, was between 20s. and 32s. In other words, the Board stated that electricity people down South were able to get their fuel that much cheaper. Meanwhile, the National Coal Board the same day suggested that the figure was not between 20s. and 32s. but was, in fact, 20s. At any rate, by and large it is agreed that the average additional cost for coal in Scotland is 20s. If in 1967–68, our coal-fired stations—that is 20 of the 23 stations—had transferred to oil, the saving would have been at least £5 million, or £6·2 million according to the Consumers' Council. This is a substantial burden on Scotland and it must receive the Minister's attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0027">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
The position has arisen because we have a social problem in relation to the coal mines, and I appreciate that it must be borne in mind. The Minister will have read this year's Annual Report of the S.S.E.B., about which the Consumers Council made it clear that if the Government were deciding, for social reasons, to keep uneconomic coal mines open, that should be accepted as a national responsibility and not one to be borne solely by Scottish consumers. On page 71 of the Annual Report we read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Minister was told that the special cost arising from the decision to use coal from uneconomic mines should be resolved at national level."</p></blockquote>
When we are considering another major extension in electricity and further investment, it is appropriate that the Minister should not merely speak of the past and try to justify what has happened this year but should give an indication to the S.S.E.B. of what will be Government policy if its coal price estimates go wrong. In other words, who will pay the difference?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As usual, the hon. Member for Motherwell (Mr. Lawson) was unfair, as he normally is in these matters, about differential prices. Apart from differences of view, I am astonished to hear an hon. Member who represents a steel constituency having such light regard for the question of fuel differentials. The future of the Scottish steel industry is bound up with this question, and I was amazed to hear his comments. In any comments I have made about pricing in gas and coal I have always said that the domestic consumer of electricity in Scotland compares favourably with the consumer in the rest of the country.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lawson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman looks up the records, when differentials were first introduced he will find that I, among other Labour hon. Members, raised the matter on the Floor of the House. The policy was introduced long since by the Conservatives. Many of us have opposed this policy in the intervening years. We have been concerned at the way in which the hon. Gentleman has persistently been pointing to large differences in gas consumption without, at the same time, pointing out how narrow in many cases are the differences in relation to electricity. As for the domestic consumer, making up the bulk of the consumption, he has not pointed out how that consumer is so much better served than the domestic consumer anywhere else in the country. It is for this sort of omission that we blame the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is utter rubbish. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I have spoken in three debates on this subject and in each one I have mentioned that the domestic consumer of electricity gets a fairer deal than does the consumer of gas and coal. The hon. Gentleman said that he and his colleagues had raised this question when they were in Opposition. Is he aware that when the Conservatives were in power the differential for gas was 13 per cent., while it is now 27 per cent? What campaigning has he done since the Labour Party came to power?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can see in the Bill the seeds of a problem which will bring the same difficulty to electricity as we have for gas, and this is all wrapped up with the question of fuel supplies. At present the S.S.E.B. consumes about 35 per cent. of the total coal output of Scotland. As a percentage, this figure will probably rise, and, even in actual terms, it will probably rise because of the new coal-fired stations and the fact that, as the hon. Member for Dundee, West pointed out, oil-fired stations are being held back. This means more load being put on coal-fired stations with compensation having to be given to the Board for this additional amount, though not, of course, in terms of the long-term estimates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister see this coal differential having an adverse effect on Scotland? In this connection, can he
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
justify the present Ministerial responsibility set-up? We find that in matters of energy supply the Minister of Power comes up for questioning. When questions are raised by the Consultative Council out of the Annual Report, it seems that, in the end, the Minister of Power must answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of the shortage of time I will be brief. [HON. MEMBERS: "Carry on."] There are many other topics I would have raised but I do not have time. For example, we know that the Electricity Board has an arrangement whereby it will sell off—the best phrase to use—a block to the smelter, thereby giving money, through Government sources, to receive a slice of Hunterston B. The smelter will be getting it at the Hunters-ton B price and not at the average price of the S.S.E.B. This, for the smelter, is a favourable development, and the Government have been generous in providing money at a favourable rate of interest, so enabling the Hunterston B price to be obtained. However, is this fair to the Scottish consumer?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the comments of the hon. Member for Motherwell about my criticisms of the S.S.E.B., he is totally wrong. As nationalised industries go, this is an extremely good one. The S.S.E.B.'s service to the consumer is an outstanding example of consumer service. The S.S.E.B.'s new arrangements for devolution of responsibility by areas is providing an excellent service to the consumer. Most hon. Members will find that any complaints they may have had about the S.S.E.B. have been diminished in recent months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, I am alarmed about the problems which the S.S.E.B. will have to face because of Government policy.

The Bill raises at once the question of the £100 million for which the Secretary of State will, if need be, come back to Parliament. I am pleased that it is to be done under the Affirmative Resolution procedure, although that will mean that the House of Commons can do no more than reject or accept the Order, and the time available will be less than if it were done by a Bill, as my hon. Friend the Member for South Angus (Mr. Bruce-Gardyne) proposed. Nevertheless, we had a useful debate two years ago in the House when a similar Order requiring Affirmative Resolution came before us, and we were able to discuss the situation at that time in the Scottish electricity industry. The present Bill gives us a further opportunity to consider the main features of our electricity programmes, to find out why the extra borrowing is needed, and where the investment will go.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0031">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>49</span>
There has already been emphasis on the rising costs which the industry faces. In addition, there are large increases in the costs of constructing new projects, because building costs having risen so much over the past four years, a development for which the Government must take a great deal of responsibility, as we have often pointed out. Moreover, running costs are increased by the 2d. a gallon surcharge on fuel oil, which the South of Scotland Board has estimated puts more than £1 million on to its costs in a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the earlier debate, on 2nd November, 1966, the Minister of State said that both Boards were seriously affected by the prices standstill which had occurred that year and that their financial position was a matter of concern. He did not say more about that today. I hope that, if he does not have time later this morning, he will be able to tell us at the Committee stage about the Government's latest assessment of the two Boards' financial position as a result of the measures following that prices standstill in the summer of 1966. I note that the smelter arrangements are separate and are excluded from the list covered by the present Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The programme for future electricity generation in Scotland must be continued. We all agree that the demand for electricity is almost certain to rise, though it is difficult to judge the precise rate. The key point in all this is that experts in fuel and power matters all agree that it is difficult to look ahead more than about five years—perhaps even for only three—and be certain what the position will be in regard to both costs and demand. This uncertainty is largely the result of the finds of natural gas in the North Sea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the debate two years ago I asked about the effects of natural gas, and the then Minister of Power acknowledged that in the future there might well be a case for natural gas-fixed electricity generating stations. A development of that kind can completely change generating methods and even the demand for electricity in years to come. Planning must, therefore, be flexible. The Government of the day should not commit themselves too much for too far ahead. They must be ready to change if new forms of energy and firing stations show themselves to be superior or cheaper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
I turn now to the question of coal, the closure of pits and the redundancy of miners—a matter affecting all of us in Scotland. The hon. Member for Midlothian (Mr. Eadie) will know of my own interest in this matter from Question Time in the House. The South of Scotland Board has made clear that it has to meet a cost of £1·5 million over three years because the Government refused its application to switch some of its generating stations to oil firing. Doubtless, that takes into account payments made by the Government to the South Board for social reasons. This is a matter to be borne in mind, since it means that the Board and its consumers are bearing that extra cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the stations under construction or in prospect. In speaking of coal, I come first to Cockenzie and Longannet. There appear to have been troubles at Cockenzie, and I hope that the Minister will be able to report on the hairline cracks and other matters which have caused delay in the full commissioning of Cockenzie. However, I note and welcome the report that the original estimate of efficiency is likely to be surpassed when the station is in full operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards Longannet, it seems at this time—I am sorry that the hon. Member for Midlothian has suddenly had to leave the Committee, because this is a subject about which he is concerned—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Miss Harvie Anderson. May the Committee have the position explained?

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems likely that we shall carry on today, but it would seem more courteous to allow the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. Miss Harvie Anderson. I had it in mind at about this point to suggest that you might use your discretion to extend the Sitting to 1.15.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Miss Harvie Anderson. At this end of the Room I did not quite hear whether you said that we shall finish at 1.15 today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not that have to be done with the consent of the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. It is within the Chairman's discretion, and the Chairman has exercised discretion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Miss Harvie Anderson. Is it not within the discretion of the Committee to decide whether it will meet on Thursday? Has that been done?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Chair has said that this Sitting will continue till 1.15. That is for today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of Order. The Sitting must finish at 1.15 today and we cannot carry on after that. I have always understood that a Committee could continue till 1.15 only if it could thereby finish its business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The only Ruling appropriate at this stage is that this Sitting will continue till 1.15. We had better see how we get on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interrupted in the course of a dissertation on coal-fired stations. Longannet will use coal. The hon. Member for Dunfermline, Burghs (Mr. Adam Hunter) spoke of the 10.000 miners who would have work as a result, reminding me that, four and a half years ago, my right hon. Friend and I were saying the same when the decision had been taken to start work at Longannet as a coal-fired station. We said that there would be work for about 10,000 miners. Cockenzie, as I recall, will provide work for about 5,000 miners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
Those decisions are proving of immense value at a time when pit closures are causing distressing redundancies in Scotland. Because of the type of coal, the price at which it can be made available, and also the technical breakthrough made in this technology about five years ago, it is possible for these stations to be brought into commission and to assist the mining industry as well as provide electricity at an economic rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards the North of Scotland Board, I hope that the Minister will tell us whether Foyers has had the go-ahead or when it is likely to be started. There is also the question of the possibility of another pumped storage station at Sioy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>And it being One o'clock.</i> The CHAIRMAN, 	<i>pursuant to Standing Order No. 66 (Meetings of Standing Committees), deferred adjourning the Committee.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the debate two years ago the Minister of State said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I cannot say where in the order of priorities this might stand, but the board is concerned about Loch Sloy in relation to pumped storage; this will come after consideration of the Hunterston proposition."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 2nd November, 1966; Vol. 735, c. 613.]</p></blockquote>
The Hunterston proposition has now been considered and decided. Some of us thought that a pumped storage scheme at Loch Sloy would be able to work in co-operation with the nuclear stations at Hunterston. What has happened to the Loch Sloy project, which seems to have completely disappeared? Has it been replaced by the Foyers project? Was there any question of its being coal-fired, and was there a difficulty about the price of coal?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most distant project in view is the possibility of a station on the Firth of Clyde. Because plans have to be flexible, I recognise that this can only be planned in general, not in detail. I believe it is right to give the Secretary of State and the Boards some flexibility in their investment plans. Despite what has been said about Mr. Goode I believe that in Scotland, provided the Secretary of State uses his powers sensibly, it is as well that he should have discretion giving him a wider area of action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two particular considerations. First of all, what is the cheapest form of fuel, and what is the cheapest form of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0033">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>53</span>
power which can be provided to Scottish consumers? One has to look ahead and gaze into the crystal ball. Secondly, and connected with this, what is the best combination which will deal with peak-load and off-peak periods? The nuclear system is particularly good for continuous generation, while other systems can conveniently be switched on and off. In the next few years the best combination can include nuclear, hydro and coal-fired stations. Plans beyond that must be flexible. We particularly urge the Government to be ready to harness any new technological achievements for the benefit of Scotland in the years ahead.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would echo the closing sentiments of the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Gordon Campbell) about changing technologies and the need to exploit every opportunity of a new technology, to give economic advantage. I also agree, and I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline Burghs (Mr. Adam Hunter) will endorse this, that in view of the importance of progress in the short period between now and 1975, there should be a flexibility or response, not only at joint planning committee level, but at the Secretary of State's level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There must be flexibility and choice depending on the thermal economics, and the way they turn out in relation to different fuels. I very much agree that, although we have no more than an instinct about this, natural gas has a greater part to play than we are presuming at present. No one can prove it. The argument has been used, alternatively, that coal is reaching its highest stage of thermal efficiency. That is why I inserted my reference to Kincardine, which has the best performance of a coal-fired station in the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know the answer to the question about Longannet. When the right hon. Gentleman opposite and his colleagues decided on the investment programme for Longannet which we are now financing, and which this Bill will partly finance, the assumption then, on the best possible evidence, I assume, was that a coal-fired station of this magnitude would be the best buy for its term of life—20 or 30 years. One naturally looks at the performance of stations to decide whether there should be conversion from coal to oil or perhaps from oil
	<span class='label label-info column'>54</span>
to coal. One may argue, as the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) did, that by converting to oil it would be beneficial for the consumers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I never said that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the argument—if only we had more oil-fired conversions, prices would be lower. That may be true now, but it may not be true in a year, or in five years' time. One therefore has to take account of many factors; not only economic factors, but also social factors.
<br><br><!-- lb --></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a number of questions to answer, and I am trying to answer them reasonably—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Gentleman knows that there is flexibility both by his party and mine about investments. This is not a party matter. I do not know why the hon. Gentleman keeps dragging this in as though there were a violently doctrinaire division between us. This is good sense, and good management. To ask what we would do if the performance of a station, which has not been commissioned and which is to be commissioned in three stages going up to 1972, goes wrong, is asking the extreme in hypothesis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have spent a considerable amount of time dealing with this matter, and I hope that the Committee will read those parts of my speech which relate to this issue. We have a joint planning committee of both Boards, which tries to give us the best possible advice about investment. There is no merit in hindsight, only in good judgment based on past experience, and this the Boards are trying to pursue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Moray and Nairn raised the question of Foyers. This is the reason why the Board, on recasting its assessments, suggested Foyers. It is true that the Secretary of State has not approved this scheme as yet. The proposal is in its early stages. If the Secretary of State decides to approve the scheme, once the procedures are completed, it may be necessary to hold a public inquiry. Once that is over, and the Secretary of State has made up his mind, the scheme will have to be laid
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0034">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>55</span>
before Parliament, and could be annulled by Resolution of either House. The scheme was inserted because of the wishes of the joint planning committee. Both boards were acting together. One of the achievements of the Government is that we have managed to get the Boards to work together. Not only are the Chairmen members of each other's Boards, but there is a joint planning committee, which is important for future generating investment, and which allows the transmission of electricity from one board to another without always having to look at the actuarial consequencies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. G. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is Foyers replacing Sloy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the moment Foyers has taken the place of Sloy in the time scale. We know that these projections were not initially accepted by the Secretary of State at any time, but it has for the moment taken its place and when the scheme comes before Parliament we can debate its advisability. The hon. Gentleman knows that I am in an awkward position in trying to comment on a scheme which has not yet come before the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a lot of circus riding today, only the horses have not all been going in the same direction. The right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) commented about the Hydro-Board, and I appreciate particularly his enlightened attitude as a landowner, though it is not reflected by some other landowners. The right hon. Gentleman went on to pick up some of the points about the Hydro-Board's difficulties and failure to bring down prices. The Board has a peculiarly difficult task, which the right hon. Gentleman acknowledged. The hon. Member for Banff (Mr. W. H. K. Baker) mentioned this in relation not just to the Highlands, but in relation to parts of his constituency in the north-east.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was 93 per cent. in 1966. If the right hon. Gentleman looks up the records, he will see that I am right. However, let us leave that point for the Committee stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of the last 4 per cent. of consumers is extremely difficult. We leave the choice of individual connections to the assessment of the Board. We do not ask that the Secretary of State should intervene on individual applications because of the peculiar difficulties. I will not go over the history of Fada Fionn, Colonel Whitbread and Aims of Industry and the other problems which have been hindering the progress of the Board, but I will come quickly to the argument about industrial prices, and particularly the question of the smelter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will not be a subsidy for the smelter in relation to the consumer. It will operate at the full cost of the power required and no burden will fall on the consumer. I say that categorically for the benefit of my hon. Friend the Member for Motherwell (Mr. Lawson) and others. We shall debate the Order tomorrow night, when perhaps we can go into the arguments about the capital cost and the appropriate tranche and the other matters which are more correctly the responsibility of the Board of Trade. Although there is a private contract between the company and the Board, the contractual arrangements are very carefully designed to ensure that the smelter will bear the full cost of the power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is already true of other large industries which have private arrangements with individual boards. That is why, when we talk about "average" prices to industry, we mean average. "Average" means that there are some above and some below, otherwise it would not be an average. The ones below the average are, to a large extent, industrial consumers whose needs for electricity can be accommodated at times advantageous to their industry and to the Board and who, therefore, get preferential terms. This is the kind of arrangement which we should like to encourage because it is advantageous, not only to the Board, but to industrial consumers.

I readily recognise that the margin between Scotland and England exists, but it is not all that substantial. The point

	<span class='label label-info column'>57</span>
of my hon. Friend the Member for Motherwell that the industrial consumer is paying less than the domestic consumer is not lost on the domestic consumer. The hon. Member for Cathcart is an expert at riding horses in all directions at the same time, but he cannot get away from this. The domestic consumer is better off. It is true that the industrial consumer in some parts of England is better off than the industrial consumer in some parts of Scotland, but we have to try to close the gap. If we were to accept the hon. Gentleman's point, we would abolish all boards and run the industry from Whitehall and have a national price, which is completely contrary to the views of both parties on the operation of many nationalised industries. I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman raises this matter time and again, but only when it suits him. He raised it again today.

Some of the questions about Mr. Goode entertained me mightily. I will not say that he was one of the influences behind the Bill. Somebody told me that he might be an omen, or a gnome from Zurich, when it comes to these matters. But this is the last thing which came into our heads—that anyone would be concerned about investment in an industry like this which is bound to benefit substantially the country as a whole in the returns which it makes not only itself but in what it services.

	<p>to borrow foreign currencies. There is a Treasury control over this, so that if it is undesirable in any way from the Treasury's point of view the Boards will not be completely free agents. The hon. Gentleman argued about the heresy of Radcliffe. I should love to spend some time on this matter; perhaps we can do so in Committee. He must be the first among his Parliamentary colleagues—the first I have heard, anyway—to talk in this way. If he looks at para. 625 of Volume 1 of the Report of the Select Committee on Nationalised Industries, he will see this:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Committee have therefore concluded that there is no point in changing the present system of borrowing long term from the Exchequer."</p></blockquote>
Perhaps we can pursue this point in Committee.</p>
	<p>May I say to my hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline Burghs (Mr. Adam Hunter) that we have accepted a very substantial usage of coal at Cockenzie and Longannet. There is in the 1967 Act provision for helping the Electricity Board in burning more coal, and in this Bill there is provision for further substantial activity by the coal mining industry.</p>
