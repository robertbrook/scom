	<p>	<b>OFFICIAL REPORT</b></p>
	<time>Tuesday, 18th March, 1969</time>
	<p>[Mr. JOHN ROBERTSON in the Chair]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>HOUSING (SCOTLAND) BILL</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That during the proceedings on the Housing (Scotland) Bill the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock.â€”[	<i>Mr. Ross.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. William Ross)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee have considered the Housing (Scotland) Bill in relation to the principle of the Bill.</p></blockquote>
In asking the Committee to consider the principle of this Bill I must emphasise that it ought to be judged as part only of the framework of housing policy for Scotland. The complete framework has been built up by a series of Acts over the last half century. Fortunately, it has been made the easier to understand by the consolidation which we carried out in the Housing (Scotland) Act, 1966, and the Housing (Financial Provisions) (Scotland) Act, 1968. But it is only a framework. The job of Government and Parliament is to get the framework right. We have to look to the local authorities, the building industry and the varied clients of the industry to carry the policy into effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I imagine that few of us, on either side of the Committee, regard the present structure as perfect. It suffers, more than anything else, from imbalance, imbalance in many ways. For example, although we have just completed another record year for new housebuilding, and although it is gratifying that a total of 41,989 houses have been completed and within that total the private sector has achieved a new record of 8,720, we cannot be content so long as Scotland is able to build only one house for owner-occupation for every four built by the public sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then there is an imbalance in some parts of the country in relation to slum clearance. Over the country as a whole we have been achieving some quite good results. We have closed or demolished in the last four years 68,800. In the four
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
years before that the number was 50,500, but the total is not large enough in relation to the problem which has to be dealt with. Some local authorities are, frankly, not allocating nearly enough of the houses they provide to rehousing those living in slum conditions. And some, while building houses on the outskirts and rehousing slum dwellers, are not doing as much as they could in actually dealing with the slums. There are two aspects to slum clearance: one is to rehouse the occupants of unsatisfactory houses; the other is to clear the site and rebuild.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, there is an imbalance between new and old. Admittedly we have in Scotland a great many houses which are so far gone that nothing will do but to replace them, probably about a quarter of a million. But the very size of that problem has sometimes blinded us to the large number of houses which are falling in standard at a time when standards are rising, but which it is still not too late to save. It will take a tremendous effort to replace all the worst houses within a reasonable time, and since the second-grade properties will have to remain in use for some years to comeâ€”I think the number is about 200,000 in this second gradeâ€”it is only common sense to divert part of our resources to saving them from degenerating into slums. If anyone would like to know how we have fallen in this respect I have the Report here which was published in 1945. My right hon. Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn) will remember it. Many of the figures used in that White Paper over 24 years ago are still being used today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we took office in 1964 the obvious need was to achieve a substantial increase in the number of new houses being built. It was also clear that insufficient information was available about the nature of the housing problem. So we resuscitated the Scottish Housing Advisory Committeeâ€”which started work in 1944â€”which the party opposite had allowed to lapse. The Committee already has produced three valuable Reports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first of these Reports was published in January, 1967, and was called "Scotland's Older Houses". It had been prepared by a sub-committee under the chairmanship of Mr. J. B. Cullingworth. Let me pay a sincere tribute to the fine work which that sub-committee did. Of course, we are all acquainted with the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0133">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
problem of Scotland's slums, but the Report gave a new emphasis to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some people discovered for the first time that there was a terrible problem here. When we have a problem of this size, concentrated within particular areas, there is an appalling task which faces us of fathers and mothers trying to bring up families in appalling conditions. It is a credit to them that so many fine families have been reared in these conditions. Let us not forget the neglect and dilapidationâ€”and the common staircases which are a disgrace to present-day Scotland and all we claim for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Legislation alone can never cure the problem of bad housing in Scotland. That task requires the co-operation of the local authorities, housing associations, owner-occupiers, landlords, tenants and, not least, the building industry. Naturally, following the publication of the Report, we had consultations with a wide range of interests, and from these emerged the proposals outlined in the White Paper "The Older Houses in Scotland: A Plan for Action" which was published last summer. Since then there have followed further consultations on the legislation required. In this connection I want to mention particularly the help which we have received from a working party of officials nominated by the local authority associations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us not underestimate the task they have. We give some figures in paragraphs 2 and 3 of the White Paper. The subcommittee considered that the condition of almost 300,000 of the older houses was so bad that they ought to be replaced quickly and drew attention to the need for rehabilitation and improvement of at least 200,000 more. This means that the number of older houses for which effective action needs to be taken or planned in future is 30 per cent. of Scotland's total.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How is it to be done? The local authorities must take the lead in driving forward in their districts the policy put out in the White Paper. They must see that houses which are worth preserving, whether they are privately owned or in public ownership, are repaired and improved, and that those which have come to the end of their useful lives are demolished and replaced. This can mean their buying up houses and doing the work themselves. But it does not necessarily mean only that; I emphasise that the local authorities must give every
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
possible assistance and encouragement to private owners to do the work themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first need will be for the local authorities to make proper surveys of their districts. On the basis of these surveys we would expect that the district would be divided up into areas, which may often be quite smallâ€”perhaps just one or two streetsâ€”but could sometimes be larger.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To help them in this, we propose to give a manual of guidance, supplementing what is in the Bill. The Bill itself lays down a new minimum standard of tolerability. A house which does not attain that standard needs to be improved or to be taken out of use. Some houses will only barely fail to meet the standard, while others will be well below it, and we shall suggest ways by which the local authorities can work out which houses, or areas of houses, should be scheduled for improvement and which for demolition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are there really still any local authorities which have not already made these surveys in great detail? Certainly Edinburgh has, for instance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to be able to say that all local authorities have done this, but they have not all done it. Whether they have done it to the extent of "Plan for Action" arising out of the problems in areas, may prove a more important matter. They have not only to schedule the area but within broad groupings to decide which ought to be dealt with first. At this stage consultation with owners is essential because their attitude may well have an effect on the decisions. The authorities will then tackle the areas in priority order, taking counsel with the interests concerned and seeing how far the owners can be helped to help themselves if they are willing to be helped.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Between 1950 and 1960 the average per year of conversions and improvement was 2,700. I am glad to say that in 1968 alone we managed to convert and improve 13,500. Before the hon. Member picks me up, even before I have fallen down, he should examine himself to see if what he did was any better. In case there are more interruptions, I have loads of figures here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, an owner may be very willing to carry out improvements, but have a difficulty about where the present tenants are to live while the work is done; and the sensible and most satisfactory solution may be for the local authority to rehouse them, on the understanding that the improved houses will be let to the original tenants or to others nominated by the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to some of the details of the Bill. This is a distinctively Scottish Bill. We have different problems in Scotland and, therefore, the Bill differs from the English Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part I of the Bill deals with houses which do not meet the tolerable standard. Unlike the present provisions about unfitness, which simply list a number of factors which have to be taken into account, but can be ignored, the new standard lists a number of tests, worded as positively and precisely as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tests include for the first time some objective itemsâ€”for example, a sink with a supply of both hot and cold water, and the exclusive use of a w.c. The important point to notice is that if the house fails to meet any single one of the tests it fails to meet the standard and, as I have already said, needs to be brought up to that standard or taken out of use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is, of course, not practicable to require every house which does not meet the new standard to be dealt with immediately. In a number of areas as much as one-third of the housing stock will not reach the standard. So the Bill gives local authorities powers to act in relation to the houses which fall below the standard, and in Clause 1 places on them a duty to secure that houses that do not reach the standard are dealt with as soon as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In place of the complex powers in Parts III and IV of the 1966 Act, which deal with "clearance areas" and "improvement areas", Clauses 4 and 5 enable local authorities to define areas in which most of the houses do not meet the tolerable standard and which they think
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
suitable for treatment, either by demolition or improvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already said we would expect them wherever possible to persuade the owners, but, where that is not possible, the authority may proceed to purchase land in the defined area and demolish the buildings or improve the houses, as the case may be. In other words, we give powers for the local authority to take initiative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clauses 6 to 15 develop the basic procedure for what will now be called housing treatment areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry to have to inflict a new definition upon the Committee. I hope no one will shorten it and call it "h.t.a" or anything like that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should draw the Committee's attention to Clause 16, which has been included to meet wishes expressed to us by local authorities. The Clause will give the authorities the power, once a housing treatment area has been defined, to apply a special scheme of occupancy control to it. It will be entirely discretionary: there will be no obligations on any local authority to adopt it, either generally or in relation to particular areas. The control would not affect the sale of the houses, but it would be an offence for anyone either to occupy a house which is subject to a control order, or to let or otherwise allow another person to occupy such a house, without the consent of the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A major obstacle to faster progress with slum clearance has been the basis of compensation payable to the owner-occupier of an unfit house when it is acquired compulsorily. Clauses 18 to 23 provide that in the circumstances there definedâ€”mainly owner-occupation of the house for two years or moreâ€”the owner of a house which is acquired or vacated as not meeting the tolerable standard is to be entitled to a supplementary payment, equal to the amount by which site value, the normal basis of compensation for an unfit house, falls short of its market value. This payment should have the effect of reducing objections from people whose major worry is the amount of compensation, and should help to make faster progress possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For houses which do not qualify for these new payments Clause 22 provides for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0135">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
an increase in the amount of the "well-maintained" payments. These arrangements will apply to houses which have been purchased or vacated on or after 1st August, 1968. This is an order to avoid unfairness and uncertainty arising between the date of publication of the White Paper and the date when the Bill becomes an Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part II of the Bill introduces new powers for local authorities to deal with houses which are in disrepair. These are designed to' deal with the kind of problem which arose in Glasgow and elsewhere following the gale of last January. A number of authorities, including Glasgow Corporation, felt inhibited by the form of their existing powers from stepping in to deal with urgent repairs to privately owned property. I remember the Secretary of State being urged to handle this like a military operation. No Secretary of State or authority could deal with this situation within the statutory powers. We felt improvements were required in the statutory powers and we are taking steps to make them. The new powers in the Bill will enable a local authority to take action at an earlier stage before deterioration has gone too far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part III of the Bill makes some important alterations to the existing arrangements for improvement grants. Private owners will still have to find half the cost of improvements, but we are proposing very substantial increases in the grant maxima which, in conjunction with the other provisions in the Bill, should encourage much wider use of these grants. The standard grant maximum is raised from Â£155 to Â£200. The discretionary grant maximum is raised from Â£500 to Â£1,200 and the maximum eligible cost for local authority schemes is raised from Â£1,400 to Â£2,500. The Bill also gives a wider discretion in relation to the condition and life required of the house after improvement and redefines "improvement" so as to include some works of repair which previously were excluded. Altogether there is a far wider range of direction now available to local authorities and to private owners in respect of bringing property up to this tolerable standard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regarding Part IV, which deals with rents, an important issue stressed by the Cullingworth Report was the need to give landlords who improve their houses an adequate return in the form of increased
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
rent. Part IV of the Bill does this by providing for the rents of houses which are improved to a fully satisfactory state to be fixed under the fair rent machinery of the Rent Act, 1965, instead of being related to former rents plus a fixed percentage of expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The local authority will first have to certify that the improvements to be carried out will bring the house up to a satisfactory standard, and the actual fixing of the rent will then be a matter for the rent officer subject to appeal to the Rent Assessment Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To safeguard individual tenants Schedule 4 to the Bill provides for the phasing of any rent increases which result from this provision over a period of years: three years if the house is already on a regulated tenancy, five years if it is on a controlled tenancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For reasons of equity we have thought it right in the Bill to deal also with the rents of houses which are already at the satisfactory standard, without the need for further improvement. In these cases, however, Clause 51 provides a delaying mechanism. This is to avoid an overload of the rent officer organisation immediately after the Bill comes into force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I sincerely hope this will be used. We will have the improvements. If we do, it may well be there will be an overloading of the Rent Officer and the Tribunal machinery. We want to avoid that before bringing in this further stage. We think priority must be given to providing a stimulus for the improvement of houses which are not yet up to standard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally in the context of improvement, I draw attention to Clauses 58 and 59 which introduce an entirely new specific grant to local authorities to help them carry out works to improve the environment of houses; for instance, by creating play spaces for children, planting trees or providing parking spaces. The Cullingworth Committee was very concerned about the lack of any provision of this kind, and anybody who is familiar with the neglect and squalor that often occur in the backlands of tenements will appreciate the need for it. The expenditure which will attract grant is such as the Secretary of State may approve, subject to a maximum of Â£100 per house in the area. The Bill is drafted to enable the Secretary of State to pay the grant in support of the proposals by a local authority to carry out works on the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0136">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
environment in any predominantly residential area. This is something on which we could spend a great deal of money, for there is much to be done, and should in itself have a great effect on the outlook of an area both from the point of view of people who pass through it and, much more important, the people who actually live there. In present economic circumstances progress is bound to be slower than many would like. In the first place we shall be looking for environmental improvements to accompany house improvements and to make them more worth while.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Naturally, I have been able to deal only with the major points in the Bill. I would emphasise that the Bill is only part of an overall policy to deal with our older houses, but I believe it can be the starting point for a major campaign to sweep away the evil housing legacy which has been with us for far too long. It seeks to face up to the real problems, the problems of the owner, the problems of the occupier, the problems of finance, and the problems of resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend it warmly to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I start by expressing congratulations to you, Mr. Robertson, on your first occupation of the Chair in a Scottish Committee?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are all indebted, on both sides of this Committee, to the Cullingworth Committee for its report. The Committee did what can only be described as an excellent job and its findings and recommendations should claim our full attention and study. I hope in due course action will be taken in line with all the recommendations of the Cullingworth Committee. This Bill clearly is based on the report of that Committee and does, to some extent, follow its recommendations. To that extent I welcome it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad the Government have produced a Bill to deal with this subject: the question of the demolition, improvement and replacement of older houses. Action is needed in order to change the financial arrangements which exist at present and to simplify the procedures for dealing with these properties. We consider, however, that this Bill can be improved. I can assure the right hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friend the Minister of State that we will make constructive suggestions to this effect at the Committee stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must consider the proposals of this Bill, which is an important part of housing
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
policy, against the circumstances of todayâ€”the soaring interest rates based on 8 per cent. Bank Rate which have a depressing effect both on the public and private sectors in all spheres of housing. If these were to continue they would slow down the implementation of proposals in this Bill. The volume of work which could be done under the procedures outlined in this Bill would be reduced if the credit squeeze and the very high interest rates which regrettably prevail today were to continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much of the Bill deals with the position of owner-occupiers. Here again, such people have been hit by the rise in the mortgage interest rate to 8Â½ per cent. last Thursday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State has in the last three or four years been saying that it is necessary in Scotland to encourage the building of houses for private ownership. We have been delighted at this conversion which has taken place since he has arrived in office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Dr. J. Dickson Mabon)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said it in Opposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. G. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it was said in Opposition we were unable to hear it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dickson Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman was not here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman is going back to before 1959, then indeed he has a point. For five years, however, I was listening fairly closely to what he was saying when he was in Opposition. I can only say that it is in the last three or four years that we have heard him encouraging, or making encouraging noises concerning, building for private ownership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of high mortgage interest rates, which are a brake on home ownership, we remember very well statements which were made in 1964 by right hon. and hon. Gentlemen opposite about how favourable interest rates were going to assist home ownership. We had the famous reference to "what we have in mind is something like 3 per cent" by the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Belper (Mr. George Brown), who was then about to become Secretary of State for Economic Affairs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0137">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. A. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not the caseâ€”I do not know the explanationâ€”that in spite of these interest rates the building societies have been flooded with greater and greater demands than ever for money for building houses? They seem to have had no restraint whatever upon them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.0 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman has hit upon one part of the problem. Building societies provide money, but they can do so only if people are investing money in building societies. What the right hon. Gentleman has pointed out is one part of the crisis which has occurred: building societies are unable to attract money in present financial circumstances. Young married people who would like to own houses find it difficult to raise the money which would now be required for mortgages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In particular, the mortgage option scheme has been nullified in its effects. The Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Renfrew, West (Mr. Buchan), and I were on the Committee that dealt with that Bill in detail. My prophecies then as to the effects if interest rates rose have unfortunately turned out to be true. Those who have taken out option mortgages were affected in a disastrous way by last week's announcement of the higher interest rate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Lawson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could not the explanation of the other side of the problem be that under this Government people with money find themselves with so many more profitable avenues into which they can put that money?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman believes that, he will believe anything. I wish him luck with his own investments if he can find anything of that kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the situation has been best summed up by the Director of Shelter, who was reported to have said last Friday on hearing the news:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In every respect it is the low income family that will suffer. Even people on the option mortgage scheme will be more heavily hit than the person who is better off and will get some relief through Income Tax.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>It seems inevitable that fewer houses will be built in the next few years and fewer people will be able to afford what we do build. The already acute pressure on rented houses will be intensified
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
and the problem of mass insecurity, overcrowding and exploitation in our most overcrowded cities will get worse"</p></blockquote>
That is a depressing comment by somebody who is in a very good position to comment upon housing conditions, particularly those in cities and urban areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mention this because the Bill sets out to deal with improvements by owner-occupiers, who will need to find the money for their contribution to improvements and for repairs. It is, therefore, a sombre and gloomy background to this discussion. We hope that the Bill, when it is enacted, probably in an improved form, will be put into effect in years to come when conditions are much more favourable than they are today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill embodies, as the Secretary of State told us, the concept of a tolerable standard. This is taken straight from the Report of the Cullingworth Committee. Does the Secretary of State intend also to do anything about the other standardâ€”a satisfactory standardâ€”which the Cullingworth Committee recommended in Recommendation 11? I agree with the concept of a tolerable standard. This is a new approach which we should attempt. However, as the Cullingworth Committee proposed two standards, I wonder whether the right hon. Gentleman is thinking of a second one, either in later legislation or in some regulations or a code.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The housing treatment areas are an attempt to combine the improvement areas, which have been in the previous legislation, and clearance areas. To the extent that the new system proposed will simplify in practice how these areas can be tackled, we on this side will support the new proposal. Questions of clarity and procedure arise into which I will not go now, but in Committee we shall be probing in an effort to ensure that the new procedure will be a simplification and will not promote doubts and question marks on procedure. For example, we believe that there should be some form of appeal by an owner on a decision taken by a local authority as between demolition and improvement, if the owner is prepared and able to improve the property, and if the property, in his opinion and in that of an appeals tribunal also, is improvable. This is necessary especially since the compensation which an owner may get for demolition may be very small.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of compulsory purchase and compensation, we note that extra
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0138">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
payments are now to be available for owner-occupiers if they have occupied property for more than two years. This may well be justified. I welcome this new attitude by the Government. But why is this not also to be available to owners who have let their property, in a similar situation of compulsory purchase? Is this simply prejudice against owners of property that is let? I hope that it is not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is, it is misplaced, because the Cullingworth Committee pointed out clearly in different places in its Report that real progress in this field depends on recognising the private owner's position. Recommendations 23 and 25 in particular state this. Recommendation 23 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is little prospect of any significant increase in improvement works by private landlords until they are allowed to charge reasonable rents and to receive a reasonable post-tax return on. their properties"</p></blockquote>
Paragraph 25 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Further study should be given to the ability of the private landlord to find money to finance repairs: there is a 	<i>prima facie</i> case for grants for repairs in. the absence of reasonable rent provisions."</p></blockquote>
When considering private landlords in this case one is inclined to think of large property companies, but many private landlords are individuals who have not much in the way of income or resources and who may own only one or two houses. They can make a contribution to the housing situation in Scotland provided that they are not penalised or discriminated against.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Improvement in the private sector is necessary as well as in the public sector because it is unlikely in the foreseeable future that there will be enough public money available to take all the necessary action on improvements. Therefore, we must take action in the private sector, and to the extent that the Secretary of State is acknowledging this now and putting something on these lines in to the Bill we welcome it. In particular, Part IV contains proposals for conversion from controlled to regulated tenancies for certain properties. The aim must be, as I have indicated from the Cullingworth Report, that the income from rent should be enough to cover contributions to the owner's share of improvement and to keep a house in a good state of repair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We commend this, but it does not go far enough. Conservative policy has already been stated and made public. When we return to office we intend to bring in a
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
depreciation allowance for privately rented houses which are modernised and in good repair. This would follow the recommendations of the Cullingworth Committee which I have just read.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, the Bill creates unnecessary delays in certain cases in bringing the rents up to a reasonable rate. The Secretary of State has just referred to these; he said that there would be an overloading of the system if this were to be done at the beginning, and therefore the operation is to be phased. I do not believe that this is necessary or that such overloading will take place. I hope that the Government will consider this again and see whether the delays, which will nullify much of the effect which the Government themselves are seeking, need to be put in or, if they are to be put in, whether they need to be as long as is suggested in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then there is a problem of families with very low incomes who cannot afford the new rentâ€”the reasonable rentâ€”to which rents of privately owned houses are to be raised. We recognise that this is a problem. For local authority housing this can be dealt with in rent rebate schemes, which fortunately are no longer an issue between the two sides of the Committee. However, there is this major anomaly in housing that similar, or even worse off, families in private accommodation have no scheme for rebates or other ways of compensating for hardship which may be caused to them if, for reasons beyond their control, they cannot afford the reasonable rent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The result of this is that the whole of private rents in certain areas have been kept down in general to meet the cases of these families. This distortion has in the long term caused great damage in both Scotland and England. It has caused damage to the housing programme because it has caused privately rented houses to fall into disrepair in many cases and it promotes an unwillingness to provide more houses for rent, which could have been a contribution to easing the housing situation. The Cullingworth Committee has given advice on this aspect in paragraph 174:
	<br><blockquote><p>"However, since landlords cannot be expected to finance repairs at current rent levels, there is a 	<i>prima facie</i> case for such grants. We would much prefer that landlords be enabled to charge more reasonable rents. Indeed we think that it is possible to make a virtue out of necessity and allow rent increases up to a pre-determined level
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0139">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
only if houses are brought up to a minimum state of repair and improvement."</p></blockquote>
I do not know whether we can by social security benefits deal with the cases of families who, if they were in local authority housing, would be getting rent rebates. Whether we do it by that means or by other means, this is a fundamental housing problem in Scotland which must be tackled so that we can restore sanity to the privately rented housing area. If we can do that, we will get improvements carried out willingly and we will also get the good maintenance that is necessary to stop many houses from falling into decay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the proposals in Part IV, how will the Government's current prices and incomes policy apply, and what effect will it have, if any, upon the rent increases which are likely in some sectors as a result of the Bill?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the rates of grant for improvements and standard amenities. I welcome the new maxima proposed in the Bill for individual rates. Everyone knows that there have been considerable rises in costs of building, particularly as a result of the Selective Employment Tax and devaluation. The real question is how many of these grants can be authorised per year in the future in the financial circumstances which obtain today. We hope that the financial crisis will be over in a few years' time and that then full use can be made of these improvement grants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the special problem of tenements, because this is a special problem in Scotland. These are solid structures many of which are capable of standing for some years to come but which are very difficult to improve. In many cases they cannot be improved without moving out all the occupants. One of the difficulties is that it is not easy to put in bathrooms. Even when a way has been found of putting in bathrooms and other amenities, it can be done in many cases only by losing some of the accommodationâ€”for example, by turning what are now three flats into two, which means that a family has to be permanently rehoused elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, facing anyone trying to carry out improvements in tenements there are the difficulties arising from the different forms of occupation in the same building.
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
There can be owner-occupiers and rent controlled tenants living side by side. It requires a great deal of tact and persuasion by local authorities to make the necessary arrangements with the occupiers of tenements so that they can be moved out and improvements can be carried out to the building as a whole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Gentleman recognises that, from the broad examples which I gave of the difficulties, appropriate to a Second Reading debate, I am aware of the many other difficulties which exist and which, no doubt, he and I can pursue when we reach Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise, as does the Government White Paper, I am glad to say, that the special problem of tenement buildings in Scotland poses something different from that met, except in one or two cities, in England. The problem requires tact, persuasion and reserve compulsory powers. It is a major operation if it is to be done without causing discontent and without meeting opposition to improvements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the attitude in the White Paper that these improvements and the whole system of house treatment areas must be done, where possible, by agreement between all the parties concerned and that the compulsory powers should be held in reserve. If local authorities were to weigh in with compulsory powers without taking enough trouble to try to get agreement first they could antagonise many of those whom the improvements are designed to benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Bill is enacted local authorities will have to take an initiative. The Cullingworth Committee has spoken of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0140">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
importance of follow-up action in Recommendation 34. It has stated that, after procedures such as are in the Bill have been put on the Statute Book, the Secretary of State should take initiatives to ensure that local authorities are making the surveys in their areas and going ahead with the action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In going through the Bill we, on this side of the Committee, will be addressing ourselves to three main objectives: first, the replacement of houses which have already gone too far to be continued for habitation; secondly, the improvement of houses where the structure still has plenty of life in it; and thirdly, the prevention of older houses, now all right, from falling into disrepair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A very important part of our housing policy in Scotland is that we should retain the large stock of houses where the fabric is sound, but which, if no special trouble is taken, could easily fall into decay in the coming 10 or 15 years. A test of the various parts of the Bill will be the extent to which it is likely to achieve the best possible results as regards these three objectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amount of work which can be done under the Bill will depend upon the financial circumstances of the day. I readily recognise that it may well be that a Conservative Government will be putting the Bill into effectâ€”</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I thought that would provoke a few sounds from the other side of the Committee. If and when, as I expect, that happens we will have in about four or five years an expanding ecomony. We will have a wave of confidence both at home and abroad which will enable the hon. Member for Motherwell (Mr. Lawson) to be sure that his investments will be successful. We hope to have the best machinery for carrying out the objectives in the Bill. This is a vital area both in housing policy and in administration for Scotland. Let us now endeavour to produce the best legislation and the most practical system for carrying it out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want at this stage to appeal to Members of the Committee to keep their speeches to reasonable length.

Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Gordon Campbell), I congratulate him on his reasonable and practical approach to the Bill. That also applies to the Secretary of State, who restrained himself from the temptation to go into past history.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman had his figures right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My early experience of the Scottish Grand Committee was that about half the time was occupied in a post mortem between Walter Elliot and Adam Mckinley as to who did and who did not do what.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As one of the failures in the attempt to solve the problem I can speak with a little experience. When we introduced this policy after the war we gave the generous reward of 5 per cent. on the capital which landlords paid out on improving houses. A very interesting experiment was made in the Gorbals where one landlord, a lady, converted three flats into two flats, providing bathrooms. She did it in a public spirit. She was allowed to charge 5 per cent. on the capital she expended, but she found that it was impossible to ask the people in that house to pay the 5 per cent. They could hardly pay the rent that they were already paying, and to ask them to pay the 5 per cent. in addition was impossible, so she gave up. Therefore, this lady improved the house very largely at her own expense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
"Landlord" became a dirty work in Scottish housing for generations. Unfortunately, we suffer from a hangover of that today. But it is almost a generation since anybody was able to make money out of building houses for private rent. Therefore, I think that we ought to scrap that hangover and deal with this as a practical problem. My attempt failed because it was impossible for landlords to recover the 5 per cent. on the money which they spent on improvements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the basic economic justification for this? It is that if these tenants have to be rehoused it costs about Â£6,000 to build a new house, and some of these
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0141">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
houses will never be as good in substance and quality as some of the existing flats. I can think of flats in the City of Edinburgh which it would be a crime to allow to fall into disrepair. The same applies to Glasgow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the problems about reconditioning flats is that they require a high proportion of skilled labour. It is not just a question of money. This rhetoric about more expansion when the Conservatives come in is just nonsense. The way to expand is not only by spending money, but by making the labour of the people doing the job more productive. While we are building hospitals, schools and factories in Scotland we have not got the labour to expend on reconditioning houses. This is the problem of rationing labour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Brewis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is to prevent the Government from training more skilled labour?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because it takes six or seven years to train skilled carpenters. This is another problem altogether. At any given time we have to ration our building labour among all these different purposes. I remember that in the Scottish Grand Committee during the education debate we wanted more schools and junior colleges. When we were discussing housing we wanted more housing. When we discussed health, we wanted more hospitals built. The fact is that to build a junior college we had to stop building 120 houses. We must apply ourselves to the practical problem: that with full employment there is a severe limit to the extent to which we can expand the production of anything unless we get more productive methods. The building trade, according to the hon. Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. W. Baxter) and the Secretary of State, is already building schools in a much shorter time. This may lead to an improvement. But we must keep in mind that there is a limit to the amount of extra work that we can get from the building trade. The result may be to put up prices so much that we lose the benefit of the extra grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How far do we want the problem solved? If it is money that is required hon. Gentlemen opposite must stop this nonsense about objecting to increased public expenditure. If the country is to spend more money on building, it requires
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
more public expenditure. If public expenditure is to be a dirty phrase then hon. Gentlemen opposite are doing as much harm to progress in this matter as anyone else. They ought to pipe down a bit on this nonsense about public expenditure. They have not produced any ideas on how it can be reduced to any extent without damaging the public.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point is the proportion of public expenditure in the grors national product as a whole. If the gross national product as a whole is expanding at a rapid rate, which is what we hope, public expenditure may not be being reduced, but it is being reduced as a proportion of the whole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the theory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what happened.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Both parties came in at the Election with programmes based on an increase of 5 per cent. per annum on productivity, which just did not mature. Therefore, we have to realise that, unless that comes about, we have to work within what exists and not what we would like to hope for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One other problem is, once we start putting houses in good condition, how far are we to go? The Secretary of State has laid down certain standardsâ€”for example, hot water at a sink. This may mean the opening up of walls and floors to put in hot water pipes. This is a major operation. However, if we simply led the water to an Ascot heater, or something like that, a woman could have hot water at her sink at relatively small cost. We must see that perfection is not the enemy of the good. A woman could have an Ascot heater more quickly, whereas it might take years to get hot water by the orthodox method of rebuilding walls, plastering ceilings and all the rest. I hope that the Secretary of State will look into this because it does not involve major repairs. It is something which can do the job without necessarily making a major operation of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for capital improvement, this is an income for the landlord and it has to be taken into account. If his house is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0142">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
depreciatingâ€”and I gather the point of the hon. Gentleman about depreciationâ€”the other side must be considered. If a house is kept in good order its value appreciates so long as inflation goes on. It has been going on during our lifetime, so that so long as there is a housing shortage the value will appreciate. While, therefore, the landlord may not get a steady income from rent he will get a potential income from the capital appreciation, just as in forestry, where some escape from death duties is allowed to encourage the appreciation of forestry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are different ways of doing this, and I must admit that, because of the past, there has no doubt on this side been a prejudice against landlords. Nobody can expect a landlord generously to pump out money to repair his houses if they are to be a dead loss to him; so if we want to persuade landlords to do this work, we have to do with them what we do with factoriesâ€”give them some inducement. Our fear of over-inducing landlords, and our fear that they will exploit the housing situation, merely defeats our purpose of getting the job done. I would ask the Secretary of State to see that a very careful calculation is made as to the balance of advantage for the community in having to rehouse a person and in giving the landlord an inducement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our scheme failed, and the scheme which came later failed, because the inducement we gave was not even sufficient to cover the out-of-pocket expenses of the people concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that with an 8 per cent. rate outside it is tough to expect landlords to improve their houses with the inducement of getting 5 per cent. We must not blame this problem on the Government. It is due to full employment, to the pressure on our resources, and to international problems, factors which have pushed the interest rate up to 8 per cent. It is a practical problem which intensifies the difficulties of the Secretary of State in getting the job done unless there is some compensation to the landlord for doing it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope this policy will be looked at not as a kind of tennis ball between two parties here, because that has failed in the past and makes not the slightest contribution to the housing problem. There is nothing more futile than arguing the question who did what and who did not because it is a difficult practical problem. I congratulate the Secretary of State
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
in making a further attempt to solve it. I cannot say I am optimistic that there will be an immediate revolutionary development as a result, but I wish him every success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past it has been frustrating to see how attempts to deal with this problem have failed because of all these snags and because of our reluctance to make sure that somebody does not make a little extra money. I feel that it is worth while sacrificing that reluctance in order to get the job done and if we can, as it were, bribe landlords to do it this may be an economy in the long run, because it will save houses. I pay tribute to Tom Johnston who saw this problem thirty years ago. He pointed out that if a landlord was to get Â£2 he had to raise the rent by Â£8 in order to pay his Income Tax and rates, so that the poor tenant had to pay Â£8 to give the landlord Â£2; this made the whole thing frustrating and ridiculous and it did not work, because no one in his senses would wish to charge somebody Â£8 extra in order to get Â£2 extra. The situation, therefore, breaks down because of all the financial difficulties of taxation and so on. Part of the rating snag has gone, but it was a problem then, and there are still problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has touched on the point of the depreciation allowance. That would greatly assist with the tax problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The landlord gets the depreciation allowance when he pays Income Tax, but I was pointing out that in considering the depreciation allowance we must consider also the appreciation in the value of the house when repairs are done.

I wish the Secretary of State every success with this scheme and I hope it works.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brewis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The tone of the right hon. Gentleman's speech will surely have touched a chord on this side. I agree very much with what he says, but I was somewhat surprised to hear him talk of conditions of full employment in Scotland, because in my area there are places where unemployment is over 10 per cent. and in the area of my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Mr. Munro) the position is a good deal worse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0143">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe there are very few skilled people who are unemployed in Scotland. When one breaks the situation down one finds that the real difficulty is in finding the right people in the right place to take the available jobs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brewis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will turn my remarks to Part III of the Bill dealing with financial assistance towards the cost of improvement and conversion. The reason for these improvement grants is a good one, because perfectly good houses have been falling into disrepair. The extent to which that has happened was brought to the notice of many people by the storm in central Scotland last January. The increase which the Secretary of State is making in the improvement grant, from Â£500 to Â£1,200, is pretty hefty, and we must congratulate him on it. I notice that the hon. Lady the Member for Hamilton (Mrs. Ewing) is not here today, but it is fair to point out that this is Â£200 more than the similar grant in England. To that extent Scotland is benefiting from this provision. It was certainly needed, because rising costs made the old Â£500 level much less than half the cost of the improvement. From figures I have from my constituency the average cost of conversion three years ago was Â£1,800 and is now nearer Â£2,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This hefty increase may possibly bring difficulties. I would ask when the new level of improvement is to come into force. From my reading of the Bill, the higher level will be payable probably somewhere near the Summer Recess. We are now in March, which is the time when builders come out of their winter quarters and are ready to do work on housing; and there is the possibility that many people who would have been doing conversions this year will be put off and will wait another year in order to get this much-increased grant. I wonder if perhaps there is not some premeditation in this because we see rentsâ€”[	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we had not taken so long over the Education Bill we would have come to this earlier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brewis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the prices and incomes policy, rents are to go up in 1971.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next point to be made on the improvement grant comes out of the Cullingworth Report. These grants are
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
discretionary, and I would ask why. In the Report we find it said that the Committee was appalled by the strong political line taken by some local authorities in Scotland who refused to operate the scheme on the ground that it was not their business to support a private housing centre. When bad housing conditions are such a cancer affecting the life and happiness of so many families in Scotland, such an attitude is completely inexcusable. I am sure that the Secretary of State will agree that if a scheme such as this were introduced the intention would be that it should be used. I would ask him, therefore, why grants are not made mandatory, or what proposals he has for ensuring that stronger measures are taken to see that these powers are used? There is a recommendation in the Cullingworth Report to this effect. I would further suggest that, as well as making the improvement grant mandatory, there should be a right of appeal when an application for an improvement grant is turned down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further point is the standard which a house has to attain when the improvement is completed. It is right that it should be up to a tolerable standard, but one often finds perfectly good, dry houses probably of two storeys, in which the ceilings or something else are not up to the building regulations. I believe that in that case it is not possible for the local sanitary inspector to give a discretionary grant, because the house when completed will not conform to the building regulations or to what is usually known as the standard of a new council house. There ought to be more latitude when a house is otherwse perfectly good; and if a tolerable standard can be reached it should be within the discretion of the sanitary inspector to allow slight deviations from the building regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Next I would ask about finance. I believe 25 per cent. of loan charges on actual improvement grants are at the cost of the local authority. Has the extra improvement grant which we hope will be coming through been allowed for in the calculation of the rate support grant?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would also ask whether this should not be tied at an interest rate of 4 per cent. as in housing subsidies for council houses. There is the further point of the money which the owner has to find to carry out his improvement. At the present time it would be very difficult to borrow money
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0144">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
for housing improvements when bank interest may be as much as 10 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to one or two rural points which do not greatly affect city housing. In our county we have a scheme to provide for all unfit houses in certain areas to be looked into, and we find considerable difficulty in getting improvements carried out. One curious difficulty we have come across is the farm cottage on a tenanted farm. In the old days a farmer usually had a lease of perhaps 14 or 19 years and the security of his lease enabled him to get a loan from the local authority for doing up his house. Nowadays, with inflation and the need to change leases from time to time, the average farm lease is expressed as being from year to year. I understand that in that case it is not possible for a local authority to give a loan on the security of the property. This has caused a certain amount of difficulty and perhaps the Minister could look into it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My last point also refers to agriculture. It is often quite uneconomic to improve an old cottage in the country by, for example, laboriously digging round all the walls in order to put in a damp course which is absolutely necessary to cure the damp. This is a task which may well take a mason six weeks. On the other hand, when building a new house it is the easiest thing in the world to put in a damp course. Often, a building which is being improved is not worth spending Â£1,800 or Â£2,000 on. In another 15 or 20 years the roof may need reslating. It would be very much better for the area and also for the country if a new cottage were built, but one finds that, as opposed to the large improvement grant of Â£1,200, all one can get for a new cottage is Â£300 or Â£240 if it is a two-apartment house. It would be very much better if the rate were raised so that there would be a choice between putting up a new house costing, say, Â£3,000, or improving an older house whose fabric has depreciated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my part of the world the land is often hill land on which the hill cow subsidy is payable. If a farmer on one side of a dyke goes in for hill farming he can get a grant of up to Â£2,000, whereas the farmer on the other side who does not qualify would get only Â£300. That is a very big difference indeed. Although it might be administratively difficult, I should like
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
new houses in rural areas to come under the farm improvement scheme. Under that scheme, 25 per cent. grants are given for new equipment on a farm, new buildings and cow houses. It seems only right to give a bigger grant for people who live in the houses and work on the farms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will undoubtedly have our co-operation on this Bill, and our help in improving it where improvement is needed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of what you said earlier, Mr. Robertson, I propose to make my speech short, although the even temper of the debate at the outset somewhat disturbs me.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have made a record of who is present and who is not. It is interesting that, although there was one Liberal Member present a short time ago, there has not so far been a S.N.P. Member present, and it is now 10 minutes to 12. Maybe the hon. Lady the Member for Hamilton (Mrs. Ewing) will make a contribution on Thursday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to get back to the Bill. This problem has many facets, as was pointed out by my right hon. Friend the Member for East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn). It has to be tackled in a variety of waysâ€”building more new houses and more in the private sector, demolishing unfit houses, improving houses not yet ready for demolition, and last, but not least, as the Secretary of State emphasised, finding the best use for available resources, not only of men and money but of materials.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder whether any study in depth has been made of the relative use to which we put these resources and of whether it is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0145">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
more profitable to devote more resources, as the Bill intends, to improving older houses than to building more new houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an interesting point. We hear all kinds of talk today about cost-benefit analysis. I wonder whether, before the Bill was produced, that kind of exercise was undertaken. The Bill concentrates mainly on the improvement of older existing houses. I hope and think that does not mean a slowing down in the demolition programme and getting rid of older slum houses. Some of the Press have been creating that impression, either by ignorance or by malice, or a combination of both. I hope my hon. Friend when he winds up will make quite clear that there will be no retarding of the slum clearance problem as a result of the implementation of the proposals in this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The record of the Government in demolition is impressive by comparisonâ€”I emphasise, only by comparisonâ€”with what their predecessors did, which is not a very gilt-edged compliment. In the last three years of Tory Government the average annual demolition programme was about 12,000. I recall Mr. John Maclay, when he was Secretary of State, saying in a debate on housing in this Committee on 30th June, 1960:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Slum clearance figures for Scotland as a whole are also encouraging."â€”[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Scottish Grand Committee,</i> 30th June, 1960; c. 169.]</p></blockquote>
The figures were 43,515 dealt with in five years previous to that speech. That was less than 9,000 yearly. The number at the moment is running at the rate of about 19,000 yearly, but the Cullingworth Report estimated that roughly 300,000 houses should be demolished in 10 years. That would mean an average of about 27,000 or 30,000 a year, which would mean that the Government programme at the moment, although by comparison is so much better, must be at least 50 per cent. better if we are to eliminate this problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of new house building, the record speaks for itself. For the first time in Scottish history we have had two or three years in which total new house building has been running at over 40,000 a year. When the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Gordon Campbell) talks about our conversion to private ownership houses, I ask what hon.
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
Members opposite did in their 13 years to encourage this. The figures today are very much better than the figures which they produced for private house building. Completions in 1962â€“63â€“64 in the private sector were just over 22,000 and in the years 1965â€“66â€“67 they were 23,374. If one judges by facts and figures and not by what is mouthed in this Committee, the record under this Government is seen to be betterâ€”I shall not say very much better, because I do not want to over-state the case, as I never doâ€”than it was under the previous Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise that unless we get a bigger proportion of private house building then, as the Church of Scotland said in its report of May, 1968:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Lack of suitable private houses is discouraging to new industry and a spur to emigration."</p></blockquote>
That is true. I have met this problem in Glenrothes when time after time I have asked what are the factors inhibiting bringing new industry there. I have been told that the first and foremost factor is lack, or comparative lack, of private house building for business executives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One can over-state the problem and give it undue emphasis and say what the reasons for this are. No doubt the hon. Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith) will wax eloquent on low rents in the public sector. There is something in that. There is an incentive in creating public house building at comparatively low rents which makes an opposite incentive to not seek to buy one's own house.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think my hon. Friend will be aware that even in the most stringent time of house building, local authorities were given this job of providing houses for executives of incoming industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh, yes, but local authorities are political bodies and they are under great pressure to build houses to rent at low rents. There is not a more political hot potato in Scotland than the rent issue. When one moves from the north of England over the Border into Scotland one is immediately impressed by the relatively poor quality of housing, compared with that of England. One reason for this is that the average English tenant is prepared to pay, and does pay, a considerably higher proportion of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0146">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
income in rent than does the average Scottish tenant. Therefore, the mean environment which one encounters in so many industrial areas of Scotland, runs counter to the attraction of industry which we want there.

My hon. Friend the Member for Midlothian (Mr. Eadie) mentioned Scottish National Party policy on this matter. We are tackling the housing problem by a variety of means. This is what is reported to have taken place in Airdrie. It is reported in the 	<i>Sunday Mail</i> of 12th November, 1967. The two Scottish Nationalist councillors said that the Government should take over local authority housing as a charge upon taxation and not on local rates. In other words, the central Government in Londonâ€”this wicked Government in Londonâ€”should take over control of all council houses as to their financing. Mr. Ian MacDonald, the Scottish organiser of S.N.P., defending this sugestion, was reported to have said that the two councillors were acting in conformity with S.N.P. policy. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We do not want to hand over complete control to London. We want the Government to accept full financial responsibility and leave control in Scotland."</p></blockquote>
This is the kind of escape hatch which some people seek to dive into rather than tackle the root causes of the housing problem in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The root causes are simply that we are not prepared either to spend enough public money or to spend enough of our private money in getting the kind of housing we want. We want good quality housing, but we are not prepared to pay for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I quote 	<i>Barclays Bank Review</i> of February, 1969, with reference to the number of dwellings completed per 1,000 of the population. These figures are for 1966, but I doubt if they are very much different now. In Sweden, there were over 12 per 1,000; in West Germany, over 10; in the Netherlands, not quite 10; in Switzerland 9Â½ in France 8; in Denmark 8; and in the U.K. 7Â½. The U.K. as a whole was worse in housing provision than all those other European countries, and in Scotland for that year the number was not quite seven. So we were well at the bottom of the league in new housing provisions. I worked out the figures and found that in 1967 we were above 7 per 1,000, but not quite 8, so we were a little better off, but not much.
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
In the previous years, under Tory Government, in 1962â€“63â€“64, the average number was 5.9 per 1,000.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brewis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would not the hon. Member agree that one of the reasons for this discrepancy is that in Sweden, which has been controlled by a Socialist Government, there is much more private building than there is in Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is much more co-operative building. Co-operative building in Sweden is an extremely important and valuable part of the building programme. I should like to see much more effort being made in Scotland to develop and encourage housing corporations. I believe this Bill will do that. It will be one contribution to the housing problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been inadequate public and private investment in housing in Scotland. Taking the figures from 1961 to 1962 and 1963 to 1964, comparing them over the first three years of our own Government, one finds in the last three complete years of the Conservative Government total public investment in housing was Â£181.6 million; in the first three years of this Government it was Â£302.5 million. That is an increase of about Â£120 million. I wonder whether hon. and right hon. Gentlemen opposite are suggesting that this is the kind of public expenditure which ought to be cut. The Leader of the Opposition has suggested it is because the larger part of that is in housing subsidies. He is on record as saying that he wants to cut, if not eliminate, housing subsidies, which must mean considerable increases in rent with no necessary increase in the quality of houses. In other words, the tenant will pay more for the same article.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If this generous provision of improvement grants retards the growth and development of multistorey blocks it will be a good thing. This is one of the consequences; if older houses are improved to that extent, one will not seek to build upwards, which is a damnable social exercise. No multistorey tenements were built in the new town of Glenrothes. A lady from the Corporation deplored thatâ€”
	<br><blockquote><p>"it really is a waste of good agricultural land to give these people cottages. Why should we not build 17 or 18-storey flats?"</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0147">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
I replied that if she felt that way she should live in the top flat of such a block. It is an extremely difficult social problem. If this Bill does anything to retard that sort of building I shall welcome it for that alone.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder why my hon. Friend, is describing the multistorey flat, is using such mild language?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said earlier, it is my nature to do that; I cannot help it; but I hope I have made the point that I do not like them very much. I would not like to live in them and I would not like to ask any of my constituents to live in them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In so far as we are improving houses on existing land, it will help to some extent to solve the land problem facing the conurbations particularly. The problems of acquiring sites for house building is an extremely difficult one, not only in the big cities but in some of the larger burghs. If the Bill helps to mitigate that problem it will be welcome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Wolrige-Gordon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made his objections plain regarding multistorey building. Could he give us an idea of the height of building he finds acceptable?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Downstairs and upstairs and nothing more than that: two floors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one uses the existing stock of houses and uses the land sensiblyâ€”there is no shortage of land in Scotlandâ€”one can diminish the development of multistorey blocks. There is no reason why the housing problem in Scotland should be solved by building higher and higher when there is so much land which is not used at all. I have a solution to the land problem but it would not meet with the agreement of the hon. Gentleman the Member for Edinburgh, North (Earl of Dalkeith). He knows exactly what I mean. It is the like of him that has created the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Shame. Withdraw.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In general I am in agreement with the Bill. We look forward to the Committee stage and to the positive, constructive Amendments which are to be put forward by the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn and his colleagues. I hope he will put forward proposals designed to decrease public expenditure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: After listening to the hon. Gentleman the Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton) several times recentlyâ€”first of all fighting to save the House of Lords and now battling in favour of home ownershipâ€”I am beginning to wonder whether we are not seeing something akin to the conversion of St. Paul. However, he hastened at the end of his speech to dismiss any such thoughts that might pass through our minds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He and others referred to the building industry as being one of the most essential matters in approaching this Bill and I will come to that later. If houses could be built of paper, I have almost enough in connection with this Bill to produce the sort of multistorey block which the hon. Gentleman dislikes, and of which I share his dislike.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In spite of that, I warmly welcome this Bill as being one of the most intriguing we have had before us for a long time, mainly because it gives us an opportunity to convert pious hopes into action on a matter which is, in my view, one of the darkest blots on our national landscape. One does not need to be a psychiatrist to realise what sort of impact environment can have on social behaviour and social attitudes in terms of human happiness, misery, crime and violence. Yet there is no other field of human advancement in which, as a nation, we have so conspicuously lagged behind the times. If, therefore, this Measure is sufficient to work the physical miracle that is needed, I shall praise its authors with all sincerity. I believe there is a good chance that it could.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With an intimate knowledge of my own constituency I can speak from the heart. I have the problem of slums such as, perhaps, no other constituency in Britain has, with the possible exception of the Gorbals. I would hasten to point out that the constituency used to contain the highest concentration of slums anywhere in Scotland. To give Edinburgh Corporation credit, it has worked wonders in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0148">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
slum clearance, even in the short time I have been the constituency's representative. Some 10,000 people in an area with an original voting strength of 44,000 have been rehoused during a period of eight or nine years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that when the Minister of State winds up he will make it clear that the Secretary of State was not referring to Edinburgh when making some rather disparaging comments about certain local authorities not working speedily enough in rehousing slum dwellers. This has been tackled with great vigour over past years. There is still much more to be done in Edinburgh, but with the outstanding Housing Chairman we have, in the form of Baillie Theurer, there is every prospect that the pace of improvement may be accelerated quite dramatically. There is certainly great scope for this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There can be very few constituencies where the most essential feature of this Bill, the modernisation of older houses, is more applicable than in Edinburgh, North, and in parts of the so-called New Town. One of the paradoxical tragedies in housing is to be found within the boundaries of my constituency. Many houses whose outward appearance is stately and of architectural magnificence contain rotting rabbit warrens. I do not know how many times I have raised this matter in various debates in the House. I can only say how thankful I am we have both a Secretary of State and a Minister of State who have at last recognised these problems with a Measure which, I hope, will produce the sort of action so desperately needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill raises certain problems in the general field of housing. I would like to elaborate a little on the points made by the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn) and the hon. Gentleman the Member for Fife, West, regarding the building industry. I should like to hear more about the Government's thinking upon this and their approach to the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In spite of the net exodus of 168,000 people from Scotland over the last four years there is still an acute shortage of houses where they are needed. The hon. Gentleman the Member for Fife, West, might perhaps like to see houses being built on top of the grouse moors of landowning dukes, but I am not sure people would want to live in them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
If house modernisation is to proceed at the pace necessary to prevent old houses from becoming slums, as well as rescuing those which have become slums, without slowing down the pace of providing new homes, there will have to be a most spectacular increase in the size of the building industry. This is the crucial point upon which the success of this Bill depends. The labour requirement in the conversion of old houses is unfortunately very high compared with the provision of new accommodation, particularly of the factory-built type. How is this problem of increasing the building industry in its size and increasing its labour force to be brought about?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apprenticeship in the building industry involves a considerable time lag between a young man going into it from school and coming out as a fully-trained operative, although I believe the period was shortened about five years. ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the number of bankruptcies is anything to go by, builders head the professions by a long way. I would refer to the Board of Trade figures for England and Wales; they possibly give a pattern which is followed in Scotland. The number of bankruptcies in the building industry at 483 is far higher than in any other trade or profession. The next highest category is that of directors and promoters of companies, at 472. I was sorry to note that painters and decorators have moved up from eighth to fifth place in the order of bankruptcies; they are very important people in the restoration of old houses. For some reason the equivalent Scottish publicationâ€”where one talks of "sequestrations"â€”does not produce a classified list by professions. It would, perhaps, be useful if it did in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

There has been much talk in the past about increasing the efficiency of the industry. I wonder what has been done about it. If recruitment to the industry is to be speeded up, and if the business of being a builder is to become more secure and remunerative, specific action will need to be taken. What action has the Minister in mind? Does he regard the Selective Employment Tax as being a help to the industry? What further taxation inducements can he suggest? I say this, not to taunt the Government, but because I honestly believe that if the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0149">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
dreams contained in the Bill are to be fulfilled, something will have to be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the Bill in rather more detail. I will try to avoid the tantalising temptation of becoming involved in Committee stage "Clause stand part" discussions. I warmly welcome and support the Bill in its aims to improve older houses which structurally still have a fair life ahead of them. The Government grants certainly should be an incentive, provided that sufficient steps are taken to make them widely known, which was not always done in the past. Many house owners will have much less excuse than hitherto for neglecting necessary modernisation, due to the combination of the higher grants and the greater freedom in subsequent rent adjustments after conversion has taken place. The additional powers which are to be given local authorities to intervene are, therefore, justified to the extent that previously they would have been condemned for infringing the rights and freedoms of the individual.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because the word "landlord" conjures up the picture of a sort of Aunt Sally to Left Wing politicians, too often it is forgotten that many owners of these poorer houses are reasonably unwealthy individuals who perhaps own only one building. As an example, I know one caseâ€”this raises the sort of problem we must cope withâ€”of a tenement block where the rooms and apartments have been divided into far too small sections. The owner cannot get possession of any one of these to carry out the type of modernisation which involves putting two houses together into one. He happens to be a man who, I am sad to say, is now dead. He was a crane driver at Granton Harbour and was very prominent in the trade union organisation. He is a typical landlord who is condemned so often by those who like to try to bring this subject within the field of party political battling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now that steps are being taken to raise improvement grants to realistic levels, namely, a maximum of Â£1,200 on a Â£2,500 improvement, can the Bill be extended for use as a vehicle for introducing a direct grant for building new homes for private owner occupation? I should perhaps have said "reintroducing", because there was a Bill in 1919 which did this very thing. Other countries do this. Good examples are West Germany and Belgium.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
There are two reasons in support of such an idea. The first is that home ownership is a good thing, I believe. I think that the excellence of the social and political atmosphere which is found in countries like Australia is largely attributable to the fact that about 85 per cent. of the population are home owners. I believe that nothing does more to undermine the whole sense of value and moral fibre of an individual as an independent and enterprising being than living in a subsidised council house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second reason is that it could be much cheaper for the taxpayer and the ratepayer. A Â£3,000 local authority house which is let at Â£75 a year, which is probably a high figure compared with what is in fact happening, will show a loss over interest rates at 7Â½ per cent. of Â£150 a year, or Â£3,000 over 20 years; whereas a direct grant of, say, 33Â½ per cent., or Â£1,000 on a Â£3,000 house, together with 7Â½ per cent. interest on that, namely, Â£75 a year, would represent a loss to the taxpayer over 20 years of, not Â£3,000, but Â£2,500. In other words, Â£500 less over a 20-year period would mean that for every 10,000 houses so switched from the local authority market to the private house market would give a saving to the taxpayer of Â£5 million, or Â£Â¼ million a year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lawson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The noble Lord has expressed the view that living in a subsidised house damages the morale. Is he not suggesting a heavy subsidy for the building of a house and for the person who would eventually own it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can see that. However, someone who has contributed the major part of the money towards buying his house is a much more independent man than someone who goes on living, week in, week out, knowing that somebody else is paying for a large part of his basic living expenses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After that digression on to what appeared to me to be a major omission from the Bill, I turn to another which is rather more closely related to it. This concerns the question of tenants' improvements. I hope that I can be corrected, but as I read the Bill there is no provision for the tenant of a house to make the improvements in a way which would qualify him for the grant and/or enable him to secure compensation from the landlord on way-going. This is a common practice in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0150">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
connection with farmhouses and buildings. I should have thought that something on these lines should have been written into the Bill, because there are undoubtedly times when the owner may not be willing to meet even his share of the cost of carrying out the improvement, whereas the tenant would. If the Bill could be slightly enlarged so as to make this possible it would be a good thing. It is a long enough Bill already, and I do not want to make it any longerâ€”</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. Could we be told whether the noble Lord is winding up for the Opposition?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was saying that I do not want to make the Bill any longer, but there is the question of how to deal with houses which either have become slums or which are in danger of becoming slums simply because they have been divided, sub-divided and sub-sub-divided over the years. There are a large number of such buildings in my constituency. With the grant structure as now proposed it would seem that there is not enough incentive to encourage an owner to put two houses into one or three houses into two. It is even possible that what incentive there is will work the other way round and encourage the owner to try to squeeze bathroom, showers, wash basins and lavatories all into a space which is already too small. I am worried about this aspect of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have liked to have spoken on a great range of matters which are highly interesting, but, thanks to my hon. Friend the Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Gordon Campbell) having covered some of them, and out of deference to other hon. Members who want to speak, I shall restrict myself to one other point of substance. This concerns the tolerable standard. I am sure that the Minister of State will have seen the memorandum produced by the Chief Sanitary Inspector for Edinburgh. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will study his comments, because they touch upon the anxieties about the definition of a "tolerable" standard. It would appear from what the Chief Sanitary Inspector said that this tolerable standard reduces rather than
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
increases the standard which was laid down in the 1966 Act. The Chief Sanitary Inspector says that there are certain omissions. The very first omission concerns the state of repair of the house; this is not included in the new list.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not have a copy of this report. I saw a reference to it in the Press. I would appreciate it if the noble Lord could help to obtain me a copy, because I am sure that there is considerable misunderstanding about this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be very happy to provide the hon. Gentleman with a copy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Attention is drawn in the memorandum to two omissions in particular. One is the structural state of repair of the house. The other point which has been omitted from this Bill but which was previously covered concerns the condition of paving and drainage of courtyards or passages. I will certainly give the Minister of State my copy of this memorandum, which covers several other points. The inference from what the Chief Sanitary Inspector says is that, because the standards appear to be being reduced, the Corporation will be more restricted than they were before in taking the necessary action to establish areas which need to be cleared and dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final word is, if the Bill really does rid the land of one of its greatest scourges, God bless it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gregor Mackenzie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The noble Lord the Member for Edinburgh, North (Earl of Dalkeith). began by saying that his constituency probably has one of the worst slum areas. I presume he meant in the east of Scotland. There is always competition amongst hon. Members on this point. The noble Lord said that he spoke from his heart, based on his experience of Edinburgh, North. I think that he will do me the credit of believing that I, too, will speak from the heart because, like everyone else on this side, I have a great deal of experience of slum dwellings in my area and in Glasgow. I have looked through the pictures printed in the Cullingworth Report and, although I accept up to the hilt that the noble Lord spoke from his experience, I can tell the Committee in amplification that I certainly
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0151">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
speak from mine, because I was born and brought up in one of the houses which we are discussing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I join issue with the noble Lord on only one matter. He was wrong to suggest that by subsidising council tenants we are sapping their moral fibre. I have not noticed over the years that subsidies have so affected other recipients. Farmers are given substantial grants. There are substantial subsidies to people whose children attend grant-aided schools. Subsidies do not seem to have a deleterious effect on the moral standards of those recipients. However, I will turn from that aspect, because, as my right hon. friend the Member for East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn) said, we must not use housing as a political tennis ball.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have one regret about the Bill. That was when the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Gordon Campbell) said, I thought rather optimistically, that whilst we were preparing it, he would be the man to put it into practice. All I can say is that it is a great pity that we did not have the Bill when we came into power in 1964.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am interested in the Bill for two reasons. First, the very obvious reason that, since we have a stock of older houses falling into a state of disrepair, it behoves us to take early and speedy action to make them habitable even for another 10, 15 or 20 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondlyâ€”and here I am not taking issue with my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton), who talked about two-storey tenementsâ€”I genuinely believe that many people in Scotland want to continue to live in the old central areas in tenement houses. Therefore, we have a duty and an obligation to make these houses habitable. We must bring them not just up to tolerable standards, but up to excellent standards. There are some excellent houses in the west of Scotland where some of our older people would like to live in an environment they understand and amongst people they know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are several difficulties I should like to mention to the Minister of State. Those of us who have had some of this work done in our constituencies, perhaps on an experimental basis, have noticed several things. Housing treatment areas
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
in the past tended to be far too small. This led to increasing costs upon either the local authority or the people involved in rehabilitating these houses. If we are to get the maximum benefit from the Bill the housing treatment areas must be fairly large.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A great deal of research still needs to be done on conversion, reconstruction and renovation. Knowhow in this respect is not possessed by the majority of small local authorities, so I am sure that they would appreciate guidance and advice which the technical people in my right hon. Friend's Department could give.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One point I noticed from one experiment was the disturbance caused to others. Unless we take a fairly large area for treatment an element of disturbance can be caused to the people immediately adjoining these properties. If we are to get, as many of us want, proper plans for environmental changes, this can only be done if the areas are fairly big.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill lays a great responsibility on the local authorities. The Secretary of State, in opening, said that we should not see the Bill in isolation; we should see it as only one part of the work which is being done in housing. However, one difficulty we will have in the renovation, reconstruction and rehabilitation of these older houses is the legal question associated with finding tenants, paying compensation, and the like. We have too few people in Scotland employed by the district valuation offices. I know that this is not a direct responsibility of my right hon. Friend, but we have been very short of district valuers in the west of Scotland and this is holding back a great deal of the redevelopment in the major conurbations. The local authorities have difficulty in finding people to do the conveyancing work. This is a real problem in Rutherglen. It has been a problem for some time, as I found as a town councillor some years ago. I hope, therefore, that we will get down to the job of looking at the structure of conveyancing, registrations, and so on, because this would be of great value to local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the majority of tenement flats multi-ownership and so forth causes many problems. One of the saddest things in recent years has been that so many people have bought these single ends and rooming kitchens which, under the present basis, they will not be able to go ahead and effectively renovate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0152">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
My hon. Friend the Member for Fife, West, talked about resources and whether we are wise at this stage to use building materials to rehabilitate houses rather than to go ahead and build new ones. I think that on this matter most of us are fairly clear: we want to build as many new houses as possible. But we must face the difficulty that the majority of people who are likely to be used for carrying out improvements to old tenement properties do not find that work as remunerative as building new houses. I have discussed this matter with the Town Council of Rutherglen. I am told that it has the greatest difficulty in getting people to do work of this kind. It can only get it done if it is able to assure the building contractors that they will get better and more remunerative building work in the new housing schemes, and so on. We must consider the shortage of people to do this kind of workâ€”not only the shortage of contractors, but the men to do the work. In the west of Scotland it is very difficult to get even the burgh workmen to do work on renovation of older houses. They prefer to work on newer houses where the work is perhaps more interesting, and I know that the bonuses are a great deal better. Therefore, I hope that we will look into this problem with some care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My last point, to which I now come, in deference to your desire for brevity, Mr. Robertson, may not be regarded by my right hon. Friend as falling completely within the scope of the Bill. My right hon. Friend said that after the Bill had gone through all its stages he proposed to issue to local authorities a manual of guidance on how they might best tackle the problem of improvement of older houses. One of the biggest problems is not these old, decayed, decrepit houses which need improving, but the number of council houses which are now 30 and 40 years old. Some of them, through no fault of the people living in them, are a social affront. I cannot speak about the east of Scotland or any other place, but throughout the west of Scotland much could be done in this regard. Grants are available to local authorities. I took the opportunity of asking my right hon. Friend about this a few weeks ago. He advised me that there has certainly been a great improvement in recent years in the number of local authorities taking up the grants available to them for improvement of
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
their existing stocks of houses. Looking at the figures, I think we could ginger up a great many of the local authorities concerned into doing a further job of work, not only in improving the structure of the houses, but improving the entire environment of schemes such as those envisaged in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certain housing schemes in the west of Scotland are regarded as block spots. I have one in my constituency. When people are asked to go to live there they say that they prefer the single end and the rooming kitchen which they have to the one black spot in my area that people do not like. So I hope that my right hon. Friend, in issuing his guidance to local authorities, will make this point clear.

With those few comments, I welcome the Bill and trust that my right hon. Friend will get it through Committee as quickly as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Fitzroy Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened with interest to the speech of the hon. Member for Rutherglen (Mr. Gregor Mackenzie). I found myself in agreement with many of the points which he made, as, indeed, I did with many of the points made by the hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton). Despite the storm warning with which the hon. Member for Fife, West, prefaced his remarks, they proved to be much less controversial than some of us had expected. I thought that the hon. Gentleman made some interesting comparisons with housing conditions in other countries. I should like to follow him by saying that some other countries are inclined to look after their old houses a good deal better than we do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like other hon. Members, I welcome the Bill. I think it will help us to perform a very necessary task. The hon. Member for Rutherglen pointed out that one of the troubles is that builders prefer to build new houses, particularly factory-built houses, to propping up and repairing older houses. There is no doubt that there are far too many old houses which have, over the years, been literally allowed to fall down but which, if they had been taken in time, could have been restored and made better even than a good many houses which are being built at the present time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also welcome the Bill because it gives more generous treatment to Scotland than is being given at present to England. Like other hon. Members, I, too, feel
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0153">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
that it is a pity that the hon. Lady the Member for Hamilton (Mrs. Ewing) has not chosen to grace the Committee with her presence today to take in that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another thing to be welcomed about the Bill is that it should help to save a certain amount of agricultural land. Scotland is littered with ruined and semi-ruined houses, some of which could be restored, or could have been restored if action had been taken in time, and which are taking up space which could be used for housing, and, therefore, not necessitate new land being taken over for that purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also welcome the excellent encouragement given by the Secretary of State to private owners to do the work themselves. This should save a lot of money all round and benefit the community as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate has not been controversial so far and I do not wish to make it so, but I should like to ask the Secretary of State or the Minister of State, when he winds up, to say how much help he thinks the Land Commission is giving with housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was glad that the Secretary of State announced a manual of guidance for local authorities. That should be very valuable indeed because in the past the practice of local authorities has not always been uniform up and down the country and this has given rise to confusion and a sense of grievance on the part of some applicants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State has said the Bill is a distinctively Scottish Bill. I would like to touch on a distinctively Scottish problem in housing, namely, damp. This is largely a technical matter. There are different kinds of damp, that coming from above, rising damp, and damp coming in from the side. This is largely a technical matter but it is also a matter of experience and I have had a certain amount of experience in damp conditions in housing. There have been great technical advances made in recent years in combatting damp and there are all kinds of new techniques which have to be studied. I hope attention will be paid to this problem and its solution, and also that care will be taken to see that. as far as possible, remedies prescribed by local authority officers are not so elaborate and costly,
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
as they sometimes are, as to frighten off prospective applicants altogether.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It does occasionally happen that the schedule of repairs drawn up by the local sanitary inspector, or whoever it may be, is too elaborate and too expensive, and thereby a house, which might have been saved, is lost. For all these reasons I was glad to hear the Secretary of State speak of "a wider range of treatment open to owners and local authorities". I hope everything will be done to encourage local authority officers to do what many of them already do, and that is, use their common sense and discretion in applying the new rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I would like to make a suggestion which has a special application to part of my own constituency, but which also applies to a great many other parts of Scotland. I would like to suggest that provision ought to be made for bigger grants to be given for the restoration and reconstruction of houses in remote areas and particularly in islands where building costs are necessarily bound to be higher. I know from past experience that a remote area is a hard thing to define, but an island, I am glad to say, is a much easier thing to define, as a glance at any child's primer of geography will show. It is also an incontrovertible fact that, as a general rule, the cost of transporting building material, sometimes even of transporting builders, to an island, and, therefore, the cost of building on an island, is bound to be higher than in comparable places on the mainland. That is certainly true of building in Bute, Arran and Cumbrae. I hope the Secretary of State will consider making provision for bigger grants for repairs, restorations and improvements carried out on these and, of course, other Scottish islands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, as far as Bute is concerned, I would remind the Secretary of State that he could change the situation radically as far as building costs and everything else is concerned by getting on with that bridge across the Kyles we have all been talking about for such a long time, instead of putting it off, as he recently did, into the remote future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As debates go on, many points which those who are waiting to speak wish to take up are dealt with by other hon. Members. The hon. Member who has just spoken commented that there has been no controversy, but that has been
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0154">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>49</span>
due to the strong sense of restraint shown by hon. Members on this side in face of some of the comments we have heard from the other side.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman the Member for Edinburgh, North (Earl of Dalkeith) cited the case of Australia. Like him, I, too, was there last year, and when he commends the way in which housing is being provided there as being a contribution to the social and economic system, and way of living, I must profoundly disagree with him. They had there exactly the same kind of attitude, continually increasing the size of cities without any planning, and it seemed to me they were not learning from the experience we have had here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would urge my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and the Minister to pay attention to what was said by my hon. Friend with regard to building labour, for this will be one of our principal difficulties. I do not think it is detracting in the least from the intentions of the Bill if we can so mobilise our effort as to ensure, through local authorities, that some part of their own labour force will be devoted to this, for otherwise we shall be in trouble. My right hon. Friend quite rightly emphasised that we can provide the legislation but that, in the last resort, the actual carrying out of the legislation must go back to the local authorities and those who are on the sites.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Bill is different from other legislation in that, in these provisions applying to Scotland, particular emphasis is laid on the replacement of older houses, whereas in legislation for England and Wales the emphasis is on improvement. Most of us welcome that feature. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) that, among those whose housing we are considering here, there are many people who have no desire for council housing as such. There are people who already have good tenement houses with bathrooms, or who are in some of the older houses which are to be improved, who would be willing to pay increased rents for those facilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would, however, make the broad generalisation, which will not have escaped my right hon. Friend's attention, that according to the Inland Revenue returns it is noticeable that almost one-third of the net incomes in Scotland are of Â£12 a week, or under. This is significant because it is precisely the groups within
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
these categories of income who are, in the main, residing in the houses we are here discussing. I will not pursue the point at this stage, but just draw my right hon. Friend's attention to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During debates on other legislation affecting house repairs, including the passage of the 1954 Act, we had long discussions on what disrepair really meant. At that time we attempted to have incorporated into the legislation amendments which would have had the effect, where power was given to increase rents, of bringing such privately owned houses into the local authority pool of exchange and transfer housing. There were instances of people living in large houses, but whose families had grown up and gone away, so that they were over-housed; whereas there were also people living in, inadequate tenement accommodation, who could and would have made mutual exchanges. Whereas the local authority, in many instances, was willing to agree to such an exchange, there was the difficulty that the private owner would not agree, even where the tenant had had the application lodged with the local authority for a number of years. I do not know whether this point could be looked at to see whether such a suggestion could be incorporated into this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with what was said by my hon. Friend the member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton) on housing. I remember that I once described buildings up in Red Road, Balornock, as "monstrosities" and I have seen or heard nothing to persuade me that they are other than just that. It is much better that the type of housing we are discussing this morning should be made reasonably habitable. That is much to be preferred, and would be preferred by the most important people involvedâ€”those who have to live in them. This is another reason why I welcome this Bill. When the New Towns Bill was going through, under a previous Government, in 1947â€“48, most of us in Scotland welcomed the legislation as the wherewithal to provide new towns where a new environment and new facilities for living would be made available. In the event, that has been most successful legislation, not least as it has been used by the Scottish Office, and we have examples of that in Glenrothes and elsewhere. Bearing that ideal situation in mind, we could try to provide, by normal methods, many more council
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0155">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>51</span>
houses. I will not pursue the point raised by the hon. Gentleman the Member for Edinburgh, North or his hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) with regard to council tenants. I restrain myselfâ€”</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:â€”particularly in his absence. My right hon. Friend is trying to incite me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must direct our attention to the success of the Scottish Office in the provision of new houses and in the pattern of public investment in housing. In 1962â€“63 it was Â£53Â½ million, and in 1966â€“67, Â£116 million. In the matter of slum clearance, as the White Paper made
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
clear, the number went up from 12,058 to 19,000. But again, as the White Paper makes clear, this is far short of the pace which the Government themselves have set. We wish them well in proceeding with that great job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I further ask my hon. Friend to consider, in the matter of environment, the picture already drawn in the Report? The frontages of some of these buildings are excellent to look at. It is in the back courts and broken down walls and the atmosphere that the frightful impression is revealedâ€”</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
