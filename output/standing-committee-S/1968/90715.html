<p>—[<i>Mr. Buchan</i>.]</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before calling on the hon. Member there are two points which I should like to make. First, the clock which will control our proceedings this morning is the one on my immediate left, which I can see. Secondly, I appeal for a little restraint from hon. Members so that as many Members as possible may speak.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This morning we are to consider a subject which is of continuing concern in Scotland, and rightly so; that is, the subject of crime and punishment. I am one of those who are especially concerned about this, not only in relation to crimes of violence which have received a considerable amount of publicity in recent years, but also in relation to the other kinds of crimes and to their total in Scotland. Like others, I have been much disturbed by the numbers of crimes of all kinds which have been carried out without the detection, and, indeed, without the conviction of the culprits. In the last week we have seen reports in the Press indicating the welcome news, which I hope the Minister will be able to confirm today, that the total number of crimes known in Scotland in 1968 was rather less than in the previous year. We greet this information with considerable relief, but, in view of the unfortunate increases in the numbers of crimes in previous years, we can only say that we are starting to contain the situation. There are certainly no grounds for complacency, or any reason for relaxing
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 202</span>
efforts on the part of the authorities' police and others concerned. As a community, we must beat this threat to civilised life.<br><br>
Last year, in an [ILL]ivalent debate in this Committee, the Under-Secretary of State told us that the strength of the police had been increased by about 100 over the figure for the previous year, and from Press reports it now seems that there has been a further increase in the strength of the police since then. There has also been added assistance to the police, in the form of traffic wardens and others who can rightly take over some of the duties which the police have been doing, which are not connected with the detection of crime.<br><br>
I should like to put a point to the Government with regard to the use—I hope the increasing use—of equipment and aids by the police to help them detect crime and bring criminals to justice. I put a Question to the Government in recent weeks, asking them what use is being made in Scotland of closed circuit television. We all know that this has had a deterrent effect in places like large self-service stores where there may have been temptations to some to serve themselves without making the required payment. Television has had considerable success there. But my point is really a wider one. If we can augment the ordinary activities of the police by aids which, in the technological age, should be becoming increasingly available, we can give the potential criminal a feeling that he does not know when he is being watched or recorded. Thus there can be a psychological effect, because such a person is not merely watching the policeman on his beat; he does not know what else is being used to record, photograph or in other ways detect what he is doing. I am not suggesting that the citizen's privacy should be invaded. Such devices should be used only in public places or in places where somebody should not be; for example, in the vaults of a bank at midnight, or somewhere like that. But I believe that more can be done, and that the results can be psychological as much as practical. The admissibility of such evidence in courts is another matter which will have to be investigated at the same time, but I do not believe that there can be great difficulties in this technological age. It is simply something which requires to be covered in order to bring matters
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0319">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 203</span>
up to date. I hope that the Minister will tell us more about what is happening in this field.<br><br>
Another question which I should like to raise is with regard to assistance from the public. I am glad to say that, in response to a Question which I have recently put to the Government, they gave quite a long reply recording the rewards which are available to the public, if they help with success in apprehending criminals by information or in other ways. If more publicity were given to this, the police and the authorities would be likely to receive greater assistance from members of the public, who might be able to contribute information or in other ways to assist in apprehending criminals.<br><br>
The Government recently announced the establishment of a new Crime Squad in Scotland. On 16th May, in answer to a Question, the Government stated that this Crime Squad had started operations, with a headquarters at Airdrie.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Dempsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. G. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to see the hon. Member for Coatbridge and Airdrie (Mr. Dempsey) here. I hope that he and his constituents will feel safer because of the fact that they have the headquarters in Airdrie.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dempsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are very happy about it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure.<br><br>
What we should like to know, because this was not divulged in that Answer, is the establishment of this new Crime Squad and what its duties are to be, if the Minister does not regard that information as confidential. I presume that there is nothing secret about it. All these measures should have the main objective of demonstrating palpably that crime does not pay, and that the criminal will not get away with his misdeeds, undetected and unconvicted. Therefore, these measures should be aimed at greatly improving the rate of detection by all means possible, including increasingly technical aids.<br><br>
I should now like to turn to the other side of the question, and to deal with prisons. The first and depressing point about the prisons is their present overcrowding in Scotland, largely as a result of the increase of crime in recent years.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 204</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dempsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a question of accommodation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure I shall be tempting some hon. Gentlemen opposite when I say that I recently spent half a day in Barlinnie. I am sure that those hon. Members who, through the courtesy of the Department concerned and the Governor, have been able to make such a visit will also have found it depressing, because of the crowded conditions, and particularly because of the large numbers of young and youngish men who form the inmates of that prison. I should say straightaway that I have a very high opinion of the prison service, and I should like to pay a tribute to the work and devotion to duty of the officers of that service. I very much hope that the Government ask for, and listen to, the advice of governors and senior staff on questions of crime and punishment. The most depressing impression that one gets is of the large numbers of young men who are there, because they have been involved in crimes of theft or dishonesty. To a great extent, this seems to be because these young men have no intention of doing an honest day's work. Indeed, some of them would be surprised if they thought they could do such a thing. Clearly, there is a great deal that needs to be done by many people to put this situation right. It depends upon family, upon social workers and upon many other influences.<br><br>
I was particularly interested in the new experiment in Scotland of the Parole Board, and I was glad to have the opportunity recently of having a general discussion with the Board about its work. It has been operating for just over a year, and it brings with it the possibility of some rehabilitation during the last one-third of a prisoner's sentence in certain conditions where the Parole Board believes, in the light of all the facts, that a prisoner can be released. It has the secondary effect of reducing overcrowding in prisons. Clearly, there is anxiety about the effects of the Board's work, but I believe that it is too soon as yet to make judgments on that. I hope very much that the Parole Board will be successful, and that it will not find that it has made misjudgments or that things go wrong, for I believe that the Parole Board can make a contribution, both in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0320">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 205</span>
the field of rehabilitation, which is very necessary, and also in the field of reducing overcrowding.<br><br>
There is too much crime in Scotland, and the public are entitled to law and order and protection in their normal daily pursuits. We on this side will not be satisfied till crime has been drastically reduced in Scotland, and today we hope to hear from the Under-Secretary of State what is the latest position. I also hope that we shall have an account of what the Government have been doing and of what action they propose to take in order to deal——</span></p>
<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Baxter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think the hon. Gentleman is near the end of his speech. I have listened very carefully, like other hon. Members, to his remarks. He has not said very much about how he would combat crime if he were at some future date to be the Secretary of State for Scotland. Could he give us briefly some of the suggestions he is going to make?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman has been here since the beginning. I intended to be brief today, Mr. Robertson, in response to your wishes, because on the last occasion I was much interrupted and I was tempted to reply at some length to a number of points put by hon. Gentlemen opposite and I found I had been longer than I had intended. Today I have concentrated on two or three points, particularly on increasing the technical aids and equipment available to the police. I can tell the hon. Gentleman that I could speak for an hour and a half if I were going into all the other things I should like to mention, but I have on other occasions, particularly on my visits to prisons and other establishments, stated some of the things that I would wish to do. Today I am concentrating on two or three things which I am pressing on the Government and which, if I were to find myself on the other side of the Committee again, I would wish to be carrying out myself. This is the day on which we have chosen to ask what the Government are doing now. This is what the Grand Committee is intended for. There are plenty of occasions which I have used to say what I think should be done in addition to what I am suggesting today.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 206</span>
We hope now for an account of what the Government are doing and what they are intending to do in order to combat a crime wave, which it looks as though we are now beginning to contain, and which it is all the more important that we should concentrate on and overcome.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Norman Buchan)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with interest and quite understand the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Gordon Campbell) when he says he would take an hour and a half to outline all that he wishes to be done. It would take me considerably longer to outline what we have in fact done, but I shall try to be brief.<br><br>
I would say in passing that there is always a tendency to say, when crime figures are going up, that it is "they" who have caused it; when they are going down, it is "we" who have achieved it; and so I think the tone this morning may be different from the tone on which we entered this same debate last year, and there is an obvious reason for this. For the first time in 13 years the total number of recorded crimes, 152,242, was less than that for the previous year.<br><br>
I do not want to be accused of complacency, so let me say that the reduction was small—971 down on the 1967 total of 153,213—but it was a reduction, and this should be contrasted with the disheartening annual increase we have been seeing for far too long. In a sense the difficulty is that with any crime figures above nil when one approves of a drop of any kind one tends to be accused of complacency, but it does give some reason for encouragement to those involved, police, social workers and others, that this has happened.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. N. R. Wylie</span> <i>rose</i>——</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have only just started.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Arising out of the hon. Gentleman's opening remarks about the tone of the debate last year, the hon. Gentleman was good enough to compliment me
<br><blockquote><p>"because, among other things, of the tone which he adopted".—[OFFICAL REPORT, <i>Scottish Grand Committee,</i> 9th May, 1968; c. 123.]</p></blockquote>
I do not recall the tone being any different.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0321">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 207</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have always regarded the hon. and learned Gentleman as a beacon of light, and I am willing to repeat this.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. T. G. D. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman does not keep his own light under a bushel anyway.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Even though crimes of violence, fortunately still only a small part of the total, have been increasing at a disproportionate and alarming rate, there is some reason for hope. The 1968 figure was 3,586, an increase of 51 over the previous year, but at 1.4 per cent. a much smaller increase than has been our past experience. In 1967 it went up by 20 per cent. but by 1968 the increase had dropped to 1.4 per cent.<br><br>
This figure includes an increase of 74 in Glasgow, and therefore it meant a small decrease in crimes of violence in the rest of Scotland. Even the Glasgow figure, as the Chief Constable has made clear, represents an increase at the beginning of the year followed by a decrease in the last six months of 1968 as compared with 1967. I do not like to base inferences on statistics on too short a period, and I do not want to predict future trends, but the information from Glasgow is firm enough to say that since the first part of 1968 there has been a downward trend in crimes of violence which, if it continues, will show up as a distinct decrease in the 1969 figures.<br><br>
How can we encourage and reinforce this trend? We tend to think of the police as crime investigators and detectors. I also like to think of them as part of the machinery which prevents crime from being committed. They can only be part of the machinery. Another part of it is the public themselves, and success in crime prevention must depend on cooperation between police and the public. The struggle is not one of the police versus the criminal but of the community versus the criminal. A good deal of crime is caused by the negligence of the citizens. The police know that if we took better precautions the crime would not have occurred. We have in each force a crime prevention officer who pays regular visits to particularly vulnerable premises and advises occupiers how to make them more secure, and all forces undertake propaganda aimed at making the community more security conscious.<br><br>
There have been two fresh initiatives in this field that are worth special mention.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 208</span>
The first is the development in the four cities and other areas of a system of crime prevention panels consisting of representatives of local voluntary and business organisations with an interest in security and crime prevention. The second is the crime prevention publicity campaign. We had local campaigns in Dundee, Glasgow and Lanarkshire, and the Scottish Chief Constables, with the assistance of the Scottish Information Office, will be mounting a national crime prevention campaign in the autumn of this year. These are all important developments which will contribute to public cooperation with the police.<br><br>
There is another important aspect of police crime prevention—the presence of the police. Often this is described as the existence of the village bobby, but we cannot racapitulate this kind of circumstance in suburban areas. We have tried to make an increased number of police available for outside duties—unit beat policing and other new systems and Panda cars. These cars are ubiquitous and easily identifiable, and they are a method of increasing the police presence, a motorised equivalent of the policeman's uniform.<br><br>
The new systems of policing will contribute to crime prevention in more than one way. They make the most effective use of manpower by emphasising the police presence in the area in which they are operating, and I believe will continue to promote better relations with the public. They give an impressively quick response to incidents and they improve the flow of information in the police service itself.<br><br>
Last, but by no means least, one of the great advantages is the response which the police officers themselves have made. Many of them prefer to operate within the new systems which not only give them greater contact with the rest of the force but places on each one more responsibility and a greater individual discretion. This is a useful boost to police morale.<br><br>
On the question of police numbers, hon. Members will recall that the police service had to share in the restrictions imposed by the financial situation, but we made it clear that no financial restrictions will apply to the development and equipment of the unit beat system. I am happy to be able to inform the Committee that by the end of this year unit beat policing or its equivalent will be in use
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0322">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 209</span>
in areas covering two-thirds of the population of Scotland and over 300 cars and 1,300 personal radios will be in use for this purpose. I have not time to go over all we have been doing in this way but I would like to refer to one or two points which the hon. Member raised.<br><br>
Firstly, the national Crime Squad. This has been operating from the middle of May and, as the hon. member has mentioned, it is established in Airdrie and Coatbridge. The establishment is 91, including 11 civilians, and its function will be to assist all the Scottish police forces in investigation and prevention of crime and the maintenance of intelligence regarding criminals. In addition to the headquarters at Airdrie we have branches in Edinburgh, Dundee and Aberdeen.<br><br>
We also accepted the recommendation of a working party report which we published last year that the Scottish police service should look for graduates from within its own ranks, and I am glad to be able to report that the number of university trained officers is increasing rapidly. There are now 18 graduates in the Scottish police service, six of them Chief Constables, and there are at present some 14 police officers from the rank of constable to inspector attending or about to begin a degree course at a university. These officers will receive full pay and allowances while attending university, and the cost of their fees will be met from public funds. We hope to see between eight and twelve serving police officers beginning a degree course each year.<br><br>
On the question of police manpower itself——</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Patrick Wolrige-Gordon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To which universities are these officers going?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To the university of their choice. If I can get a breakdown on that I will advise the hon. Gentleman. There is no question of our directing them in this matter. It is a means of attracting more men to the service.<br><br>
At the present time there are 600 more policemen—I am not talking about manpower.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. A. Woodburn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What about the police college?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are 101 things I could mention. There are now something
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 210</span>
like 600 more policemen in Scotland than at the end of 1962. There is now one policeman for every 527 people in Scotland as compared with one policeman for every 743 people 20 years ago.<br><br>
The figure I have given would be incomplete if we left out of account supporting manpower such as traffic wardens and civilians. Their numbers have increased from 1962, when we had 31 wardens, to over 500 today, and other civilians from 900 in 1962 to nearly 1,300. As a result, the actual manpower available to the police force—not regular police officers but total manpower—has moved up from 10,600 in 1962 to over 12,000 today. There has been a real increase in manpower. The picture here is of a force of regular policemen itself growing in numbers and backed up by more voluntary staff aided by vehicles and wireless. This is increasing very rapidly. They are being put to maximum advantage in the new system of unit beat policing.<br><br>
11.0 a.m.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked me about new equipment. I do not want to theorise about television and other things, but the police are becoming, to use economic jargon, capital intensive. In 1964–65, expenditure on police vehicles in Scotland was £202,000 and the provisional figure for this year is £385,000, almost double. The expenditure on wireless in 1964–65 was £42,000 and the provisional figure for this year is £194,000. We have spent about five times as much as in 1964–65 and when we look at the shortfall in police compared with the establishment target figure we must keep two points in mind, an increase in manpower and above all more efficiency.<br><br>
I would like to see more police in certain areas. There are six areas where the gap between strength and establishment is still 5 per cent.<br><br>
Glasgow is a particular problem and I am pleased that there has been a slight improvement this year, although it is only marginal. It does reverse the tendency of the force to fall in numbers in previous years, and with the under-manning allowance to help attract recruits and to reduce wastage I know that Glasgow will take advantage of its opportunities to recruit.<br><br>
Last year we tended to be concentrating on violence, particularly youth violence. Hon. Members will remember something
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0323">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 211</span>
of the pressures to which the Government were subjected. I do not complain about that. It was correct that we should stress the importance of law and order in a civilised community. It was and is right to be concerned with the world-wide tendency to violence among young people. I argued then and I argue now that legislation is not, by itself, an effective answer. An effective police force is part of the answer, and an important part. I have pointed out how we have been increasing the strength of the police.<br><br>
But the main answer is in social measures. Hooliganism and vandalism are an expression of young people towards the community with which they feel no links. There has been recognition that vast new housing schemes can create their own tensions. The task remains, to create a community in which young people willingly accept law and order because of their share in creating that community. We have taken certain legislative steps to help in guiding the community, such as the Social Work (Scotland) Act. Leadership must come from the voluntary bodies, and I draw attention to the work of the working party in Glasgow.<br><br>
Young people tend to be sceptical and cynical about some of our faults today and I am not surprised when I look at the history of this century. With all their faults, I know of no generation of young people which has contained more who are directly involved in social work. They often reject the term "do-gooder" with contempt, but a large proportion of young people are engaged in this kind of work. I would prefer them to march for War on Want than in the direction in which the adult world pushed young people in the earlier part of this century. It is a good generation on the whole, and we must cherish it, but it is changing, and maturing, rapidly, and this sharpens the problem of how to handle young people when they fall foul of the law.<br><br>
The hon. Member referred to overcrowding in prisons, especially among young people. It is true that the prison population is increasing, and at the end of June there were nearly 3,400 prisoners in institutions intended to house 2,650, while the young offenders' institutions, borstals and detention centres are also overcrowded.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 212</span>
For those who think that heavier sentences are the sole panacea for crime, I would point out this increase is not the result of increased crime alone, but also of the increased weight of sentences. In the case of offenders sentenced to detention in borstal or young offenders' institutions the number of sentences increased by 26 per cent. between 1966 and 1968, while the increase in the number of young people convicted of crimes was only 10 per cent. The number of adults sentenced to imprisonment, as opposed to other types of sentence, increased by 7 cent. in 1968 compared with the previous year, but the number convicted of any charge decreased by 6 per cent. One has to look at this when looking at the total prison population. That is largely the result of a heavier sentencing policy. I will leave the matter there, because I know that several hon. Members wish to raise this point. In the two years or so, since the first calculations were made of the Parole Board's job workload—the number of offenders coming within their purview—the number has increased by 50 per cent. The demand on prison resources has also increased because of the action taken by courts on unpaid fines. This alone meant an increase of 1,960 people in 1967.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How many are on parole?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will deal with parole after. I think off the cuff—and I will check on this figure for the right hon. Member—that it is 90.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Ninety?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it is of that order.<br><br>
How does one deal with this? One method is larger and larger institutions, but that is regrettable. There can also be a change in sentencing policy. The first of these is within my purview and I have been doing that.<br><br>
In the period 1962–63 £1,406,000 was spent on prisons. In 1965–6 this increased to £3.5 million. We have doubled our capital expenditure on prisons over the past four years. The position is the more remarkable when we look at the wasted years in the 'fifties. If steps had been taken then I should not have inherited such a headache as I have. We are spending 10 times as much on capital

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 213</span>
work as we did 10 years ago, and hon. Members should keep this in mind when they point, correctly, to the difficulties we face in our institutions at present.<br><br>
I turn to the custodial treatment of those between 16 and 21. There has been an increase in the number of custodial sentences, and a growing maturity of young people. This makes us look atwhat kind of treatment becomes appropriate. We have reduced the age of majority to 18. Do we still detain people of under 21? Let it be 18, 21 or 23, we must also look at the custodial options: young offenders' institutions, borstals or detention centres. Each disposal is followed by different arrangements for after-care. The regime in each institution is determined by objectives of treatment and the relevant periods of detention, but is also affected by the type of offender assigned by the courts. The process of assignment is crucial to the success of the institution in achieving rehabilitation. It is no easy matter for the bench to make the right kind of choice. With this in mind I have initiated discussions with those principally concerned, including representatives of the bench, the police and the penal and social services. What has emerged is that we should consider whether a more flexible system should be introduced so that the whole range of resources should be utilised as necessary. It may be that we could get more flexibility in placing. It is a matter for consideration whether the sharp distinction between types of institution should be maintained, or whether we should provide that the courts' sentences of detention should be followed by an assessment in depth of the regimes in which the offender should be detained. Another question is the length of sentence which should be imposed. Legislation would be necessary to secure any fundamental change just as more consultation would be necessary.<br><br>
At present I mention only the possibility for change. I thought it right to give the Committee an indication of my own thinking on this problem.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Member say whether these discussions he is having will go so far particularly with regard to rehabilitation and whether dangerous young offenders can be transferred to prison and not remain causing trouble in young offenders' institutions?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 214</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to enlarge at this stage. Flexibility in prisons and any aspect of it will be considered.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward M. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the Under-Secretary on a constructive and lively speech after last night's Sitting. I must declare an interest, as hon. Members know, as I am the adviser to the Scottish Police Federation.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary once again mentioned, as in previous speeches, how he believes that the crime figures are related to deep-rooted social causes. He mentioned this again as he did last year, and he objected to and resented some of us mentioning crime figures rather as we mention the balance of payments figures as an important guide to the economy. Without wishing to go into this problem in any detail I would simply draw the Under-Secretary's attenton to two Answers which he gave me on murders and crimes of violence. On 5th May I asked what murders and crimes of violence there had been for the 11 years between 1946 and 1957, the 11 years immediately after the war when, if deep-rooted social changes have any significance, that would have been the time, and I was told that in this period we did not see a dramatic rise in crimes of violence. The number of murders in Scotland fell by 33 per cent. and the number of crimes of violence was almost static—1,121 in 1946 and 1,116 in 1957, 0.4 per cent. fewer.<br><br>
We had a period of 11 years immediately after the war, then, when there was no change in crimes of violence and a marginal reduction in murder. But for the 11 years immediately following, from 1957 to 1968, we saw a dramatic change when, instead of carrying on at this level, there was a substantial upsurge, and crimes of violence shot up from 1,100 to 3,600, an increase of 200 per cent., and the number of murders rose by 242 per cent. While we certainly should not place too much emphasis on figures, at least those who disagree, like the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) must themselves give a reason why we had a sudden change in 1957. In the period of 11 postwar years the figure was static, and in the 11 years thereafter there was a sudden upsurge, and we should ask why this is so. I feel that the partial abolition of capital punishment, and then, a few years later, in 1965, the eventual total abolition, changed the whole pattern of crimes of violence.</span></p>

<p>11. 15 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dempsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. I am sure he would be the first to agree that this is due to a combination of facts, not the least being that more and more people have television in their homes, and television programmes glorify murder, rape and other sex crimes. Surely one of the best ways of tackling this situation would be to achieve much more control over television programmes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I always have a great deal of sympathy with the views of the hon. Member for Coatbridge and Airdrie (Mr. Dempsey), but the fact is that the one country in the world where, by Act of Parliament, there is no television, namely South Africa, there has also been an increase in crimes of violence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman also take into account that in South Africa, where capital punishment still exists, about half the capital punishment which occurs in the Western world is carried out. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman would care to link that with his earlier remarks.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I could discuss with the Minister the trend in figures in South Africa, but without entering too much into international comparisons, I would ask him to think of these figures carefully.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Archie Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When the hon. Gentleman is quoting figures for the 11 years will he remember the place that parental control ought to take? During and after the war more and more women were going into industry and more and more children were running about the streets until all hours, while their parents were on shift work. I believe this is the basis on which youngsters go wrong, and now those same youngsters are reaching the age where they are committing serious crimes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree that it might well be a contributory cause, the change in the pattern of family life. All I am saying is that we must consider more than just this if we are looking for a reason for the sudden change. I hope the Minister will think seriously about this.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 216</span>
The Report of the Chief Inspector of Constabularies pays tribute to the remarkable fact that
<br><blockquote><p>"for the first time since 1955 there has been a slight decrease in the total of crimes made known to the police".</p></blockquote>
This is a welcome trend, of course, even although it is only 0.6 per cent. It is the first time that there has been a decrease for many years.<br><br>
However, more remarkable by far is the fact that, had it not been for Glasgow, the decrease in the Scottish figures would not have taken place at all. Last year in Glasgow crimes made known to the police fell by almost 5 per cent. and offences made known to the police fell by a massive 13 per cent. This is a praiseworthy triumph for the Glasgow police force, which is operating with an almost constant shortage of over 450 men out of a total authorised strength of 3,000. Sir James Robertson and the Glasgow police force are to be congratulated on this achievement. In addition, I am sure the Minister would agree that tributes should be paid to the energetic police Convener of Glasgow, Bailie James Anderson, whose constructive and tough policies in the battle against crime have shown results and are continuing to do so in 1969.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Winifred Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman see anything laudable in the action of the gentlemen he has just mentioned in condeming a venture while he was still a trustee—namely of the Easterhouse project—before that project had more than a few months' life.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would like to go into this question in detail. There are three great housing schemes in Glasgow, and if there was any question about the virtue of the gentleman, surely his tireless work in another great housing scheme is a better tribute to his character and integrity than perhaps some stories which have circulated later.<br><br>
Referring to police recruitment in Scotland, I think it is dangerous to talk about increases in numbers since 1962 by themselves because the changes in responsibilities, and indeed in the work carried out by the police force, are related to legislation, and there has been a considerable increase in the burden placed on the police. Despite what has been said, the shortage in Scotland is still well over 800
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0326">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 217</span>
and the net recruitment in 1968 was only a tiny 49. For the first half of 1969 the figures are bitterly disappointing. As the Minister explained recently, in the first six months of 1969 there was a loss of 20 officers. So although it is wrong to read too much into marginal changes there was a net loss over that period of six months. The recruits are coming forward, but they can hardly keep pace with the wastage, and the fact that over 400 men left the forces voluntarily in 1968, and that the majority gave their reason for leaving as the obtaining of a better paid job, or emigration, is a reflection on the priority which the community is prepared to give in the battle against crime. Many officers with over 10 years' service left for these reasons. The Minister has mentioned that more men are available to the police. We have more civilianisation and more traffic wardens, and they are making a contribution, particularly in relation to additional burdens placed on the police by new legislation, but I think the Minister would be the first to agree that they are no substitute for fully trained police officers, and civilianisation is no answer to the chronic manpower shortage. This is not something we can blame on this Government or the present Minister. This shortage of manpower has been going on for many years and it is easy to suggest that there is a simple answer to the problem. However, I hope the Minister will not say that in civilianisation and the extension of the powers and functions of traffic wardens we will try to find an easy way out of the shortage. I know that is not in his mind at the present time.<br><br>
There are two other small points I wish to raise. The first is the question of unpaid fines. The importance of preserving the structure of our law enforcement depends on the courts and on the penalties imposed by those courts being credible. The Minister recently gave the information that at the last date when the matter was inquired into there were over £300,000 unpaid fines in Scotland, and he said that we must reduce this figure; but at the same time a certain amount is being paid in fines in instalments, and to that extent the figures had to be reduced.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. Gentleman got the percentage of unpaid fines outstanding which are being paid regularly by instalments?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 218</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I have not. The Minister explained that it would take too much time and trouble to get this information, but the total amount unpaid is increasing substantially.<br><br>
What is the easy answer? It is difficult to send them to prison if the prisons are full, and it is difficult to take the money out of their wages if they do not work. I was glad to hear that the Minister had referred the problem to a university group.<br><br>
I have one final point on the question of accommodation, both for police officers and the police forces. At page 8, paragraph 39, of the Report, there is, perhaps, the one small point of criticism, when it was stated that it would be unfortunate if, in the need for economy, decreased expenditure should result in a slowing up of the police building programme to an extent which fell short of the need. The Minister must be aware that there are many areas in Scotland where the accommodation available to the police forces is seriously substandard and calls for attention. It would be helpful if the Minister could indicate what the programme will be in the coming years. When we see the difference which has resulted from the building of new headquarters in Dumbartonshire, and the increased efficiency of the service which is provided, it is obvious that this should have a high priority. On the question of accommodation for police forces, one of the problems which tends to result in wastage is that of difficulties over accommodation and the police equivalent of the tied house. Home ownership should be encouraged, and I wonder whether the Minister could say anything on what has been done?<br><br>
As the Minister said in his opening remarks, we are embarking on this debate when, for the first time, we can see an improvement in the overall global figures. I hope the Minister will not read too much into this trend, and will pay special attention to the way in which this has been treated in Glasgow.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would like to associate myself with the appreciation which has been expressed for the work of the police and the prison officers. Theirs is an exceedingly difficult job, involving difficult personal relationships, and on the whole it is carried out exceptionally well, and yet neither one nor the other get much
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0327">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 219</span>
credit for it. At the same time I would like to express my personal appreciation—and I am sure other hon. Members would wish to be associated with it—to Miss Hobkirk, who is leaving Greenock Prison. She has done excellent work in improving the conditions for women prisoners, and has earned for herself a national reputation in the performance of that work. I wish her well in the future.<br><br>
I am glad that improvements have been made in the police forces, including the numbers and the equipment, but I am still convinced that far more use should be made of traffic wardens than is being done at the present time. Edinburgh is cluttered up with policemen doing the jobs of traffic wardens. A great deal has been done but much more could be done, and I would remind the Under-Secretary that whereas the proportion of police to the population shows an improvement we have to realise the enormous number of extra jobs that policemen now have to do, particularly in connection with traffic. Therefore I consider that a much better use should be made of the traffic wardens, even if it means increasing their numbers or improving the standards generally.<br><br>
I am pleased that the unit beat system is growing, but I think the police should do far more to improve their relationships with the public. I do not know whether other hon. Members are like me, but I do not know the policeman on my beat. How many Members of this Committee know the policemen on their beat? Apparently there are four, out of some 20 or 30 hon. Members, and we are people who are very well known and we ought to know other people.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend allow me?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, but other people want to take part in this, and I must get on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman does not look very sorry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a great deal more which should be done to improve the relationships with the public, because I am convinced that members of the public feel that their relationship with the police is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 220</span>
important, and in fact it should have a much greater influence on the job they are doing.<br><br>
Turning now to prisons and other institutions, the increase in the population in those places must give cause for a certain amount of concern. The conditions in the prisons are terrible, and we are to blame. The Government have not spent money on them to the extent that they ought to have done, and I refer particularly to the party opposite. We passed an excellent Criminal Justice Act in 1948 but nothing was done to build a single institution to implement that Act until about 1961 or 1962. The record is a shocking one. It is no good passing Acts of Parliament and providing subsidies for buildings if nothing is done. Some steps have been taken to improve the accommodation for young offenders but the community, the people, have got to face up to this problem of overcrowding, with sometimes three in a cell. At the present time there must be hundreds of people living three in a cell day after day, week in week out. Under those conditions how can we expect to produce good citizens in the end? If anyone says it is possible he is talking through his hat.<br><br>
11.30 a.m.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary has said, the number of young offenders has greatly increased and sheriffs have been sending young people to institutions as quickly as they can. But I wonder how many of them know of the conditions there. When I myself inquired into this question I asked whether sheriffs really knew the kind of institutions to which they were sending people. I asked whether they knew the difference between a detention centre and a young offenders' institution or between a detention centre and an approved school. I found that only a small number of sheriffs actually visited these places and saw the kind of conditions to which they were sending young people. Sheriffs have spent some time considering the whole question of sentences but they have to be far more aware of what is actually going on and what these institutions do. It is no good sending young people to them unless the sheriffs themselves have seen the inside of these places and know what the conditions are in them. Something should be done about that.<br><br>
I also believe that there should be some provision whereby those in a young
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0328">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 221</span>
offenders' institution who become too much of a nuisance can be sent to prison. Under the 1963 Act, it was provided that everyone below the age of 21 had to be sent to an institution. I am quite convinced that the trouble at the institution in the constituency of the hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro), the young offenders' institution at Dumfries, could have been stopped if it had been possible to take two or three of the people from there and send them to Perth or Peterhead. Those people were cock of the walk at Dumfries. They ruled the institution. Had they been sent to a prison the difficulty could have been dealt with.<br><br>
I am attracted to this idea of my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of having some interchangeability between the various institutions. This could be very useful. But we have to look at this from the point of view of the young offender under 21. It is the country which has to decide what will happen to them. For the offender over 21 it is the Government who decide what kind of course he is to take in prison and what will be done to help him. It always seems to me that there is something wrong there.<br><br>
I believe that we should have rather more open prison accommodation. There is no doubt that an excellent job of work is done at Penninghame. Anyone who goes there must be enormously impressed by the work that is being done. We in Scotland are very fortunate in having a large amount of borstal accommodation, much more than there is in England; but we have not as much open prison accommodation. I do not know whether or not the introduction of the parole system will lessen the need for more such accommodation, but if it does not, then some extension or expansion of open prison accommodation might be useful.<br><br>
In the last 25 years we have gone through an enormous social revolution, and obviously such a revolution is going to create tremendous social problems. There was no drug problem until young people had the money to buy drugs. We did not get ton-up motor cycle boys until they could afford to buy motor cycles. We did not have many of these problems until young people had the money to enable them to do these various things. Again, we have torn the centres out of cities and built vast estates, making very little provision for young people. We have instituted a social system under
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 222</span>
which it is accepted that a wife as well as a husband goes out to work. Anyone who has canvassed a street in the afternoon will known that one is lucky to find even one or two people at home.<br><br>
Our bookstalls are covered with books 50 per cent. of which are devoted to sadism, violence and sex. I have spent a lifetime with books, and I am not one for censorship, but it seems to me that if we present our young people with a mixture of sex and violence as the norm they are going to do these things as the norm. Hon. Members will find such books on every bookstall in the country, even the most respectable. The great James Bond was a mixture of pure sex and violence. We have done the same thing on television. All that is done in the sense of giving much greater freedom, but if sex and violence are presented as the norm in people's homes then we must expect young people to accept those things as the norm. There are enormous problems to be solved here.<br><br>
I believe we should try to spend far more time in getting down to the causes. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) spoke of the great increase in crime. We know very little about the causes of these things and much more time should be spent on studying them. There must be a much greater degree of co-operation between local authorities and voluntary bodies to find out what is necessary so as to provide young people with useful things to do; and local authorities themselves have to play a much more positive role in this. Certainly, from what I see in my own limited field, local authorities do not do nearly enough or do not co-operate sufficiently with others in this work.<br><br>
I believe we should be making a great mistake if we were to try to over-simplify this problem at this time. It is a difficult problem, needing a great deal of analysis and action by a great many bodies and authorities. I would like to see much more being done by various people, more research and more money being spent on this problem. Very little money is being spent at the present time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wolrige-Gordon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are talking today about crime, police and prisons. For many people that is a very natural grouping, and I am very grateful to you, Mr. Robertson, for calling me to speak against one and for the other.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0329">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 223</span>
Dealing first with crime, we are all very well aware, since it has come up in the debate, of the seriousness of the position, and I believe we should congratulate the Under-Secretary and his right hon. Friend for any improvement, however small, in the figures. Certainly, they would be held to blame if the figures continued to get even worse. We should pay tribute to them for the small reduction which there has been this year. I hope they will continue the good work. It is only fair that that tribute should be paid.<br><br>
I must admit that I sometimes wonder whether it is possible to relate any increase there may be at the present time in our country in what used to be known as immorality to the increase in crime. We have heard a certain amount about this in the speeches of my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) and the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis). I would be very interested to know the Government's view on that particular question. Is there or is there not a connection? As we all know, it is a very wide field. We have heard from the right hon. Gentleman opposite about sex and violence in books and on television, and we have heard of wives going out to work and so on, so that the children are unable to get home after school. It is a very wide field which may or may not affect the crime picture in our country.<br><br>
Personally, I do not believe that there is much that we ourselves can or should do about television, news-stands or whatever. I have always felt that the really valuable censorship is the censorship, the discipline, which is self-imposed. But we can and should consider our own role in the matter, because there is no doubt that, in addition to the influences which have already been mentioned during the debate, quite a few people in this country believe that we have some part to play. I wonder whether we have.<br><br>
It seems to me that a consequence of much of the legislation of a permissive nature which we have passed in recent years has been to tend to remove the effects, the penalties, of wrongdoing from the wrongdoer. This is not a party matter. I believe the Conservative Party did exactly the same when in power, and that has continued. Although I do not want to arouse any emotion, perhaps the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 224</span>
most obvious example is abortion for a student or teenage girl. That is a clear example of how we remove the immediate cost of a mistake or wrongful action. The same thing applies in many different fields, like drink, drugs and gambling. The danger of which we have to be aware is that, if we pretend that certain acts are not wrong, or that the consequences of such acts can be evaded, then, inevitably, many people will take us at our word. In the end they will have to pay, for they always do; but meanwhile they have been enabled to persist in a delusion through which, in the end, we all suffer. As an example, the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Dewar) is reported to be longing to introduce into Scotland the divorce reform which we have just passed in England. He is absolutely entitled to his view, but I do hope that in his concern for people who are unhappily married, and who feel that divorce is the only answer, he will consider also the effect of such action on the children, and the possible effect on the crime rate, if he seeks to introduce a Measure of this kind into Scotland.<br><br>
11.45 a.m.<br><br>
That is what I mean, when I talk about the effects of the permissive legislation which we have passed. It could have quite an impact on the problems which we are discussing today. So I should very much like to know whether the Government think that I am at all right, and whether there is any connection. I know that legislation cannot make bad people good. That requires an act of God, and that can happen at any time, but I am quite convinced of two things: first, that when a society has become so confused that it does not any longer know the difference between right and wrong, a solid law is the only anchor which many people have; and, secondly, that if we continue to legislate as we have done in the past several years merely to meet human weakness, we shall, in the end, destroy the real strength of our nation: its character. That can go very fast, once it is decided to let it go, and an indication of its going is when the crime rate becomes the serious problem that it is today.<br><br>
I was interested to hear the comments of the Under-Secretary about the proportion of policemen to the population. He
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0330">Image</span>

said that the figure is one policeman to every 543 people, as opposed to 700, twenty years ago. In a sense, that is a good thing. But if there are 1,000 people who are law-abiding, then one policeman is all that is needed. I only hope that we do not get into the position—I am sure that we shall not—when a Minister can say, "We have one policeman for every person in this country. Is not that a good thing?"<br><br>
Of course, the police and the prison service have to bear the brunt of this problem, as they are in the front line. We are in the second line and are often very slow to assimilate a point until it strikes us directly, but it is worth saying that we may be the next ones to be coshed, robbed or cheated. The police and the prison service have gone on record as saying that tougher penalties are essential. I believe that they are right, and that there is an increasing consensus in the country who agree, as evidenced by the Minister when he talked about the development of stiffer penalties.<br><br>
I believe that there is a lot more to crime and to curing it than merely punishment. Some time ago I watched a B.B.C. programme on the prison service, when prisoners and ex-convicts were questioned, as well as reformers, prison workers and other people. I am sure that the B.B.C. tried to do a very objective job, and I do not question the quality of the programme, but what struck me was the way the prisoners claimed that the worst thing of all was the loss of their identity as human beings. That may or may not be intended, and it may or may not happen very much in the prison world, but no result could be more unfortunate, if we are really serious in our intention to rehabilitate our fellow human beings. I do not mean that we should not be severe, but if we think that the way to reconstruct somebody is, first, to break him down into an anonymous shadow, then we are making a very old and very familiar mistake.<br><br>
Once human beings have gone to prison, we have obviously left the reconstruction a little too late, and in some ways it is like expecting a drill sergeant, in the old days of National Service, to remedy 18 years of indiscipline in the home. It is not fair to anybody. If we want to change the serious picture of crime in our country, we must be far more aware of the effect of personal example in society
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 226</span>
as a whole, and must stop even appearing to back wrongdoing with the law. We must also be able to present frustrated, bitter, disappointed men and women with a satisfying purpose for their lives. Nothing could better help to alleviate the lot of the police, the prison service, and the unfortunate criminals themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Richard Buchanan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to deal very briefly with one or two points, and to follow the excellent example of Members who have already spoken. I should, however, like to take up one point which the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) made about capital punishment. I have been on both sides of this terrible fence, since I have witnessed a hanging and asked myself the question: "What was I doing there, watching a man's life being taken away?" He may have committed a crime, but the operative word is, "may". One is never sure that one is hanging the man who has committed a crime, and on that occasion there was a degree of doubt. He died on the scaffold protesting his innocence. But the deed having been done judicially, in cold blood, there was no retraction.<br><br>
On the other side, I had a very close relative who had a knife stuck into him on a Friday night two years ago. It was a completely pointless and useless and unnecessary assault. There was a scrap and suddenly a knife flashed and the deed was done. One instinctively says, "All right, an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth". My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Hugh D. Brown), in whose constituency it happened, visited the people. It was said that the boy was not a bad boy and never had been a bad boy, and he might have a future, in which to reinstate himself. I pray this might be so. To say that to bring back capital punishment would in any way reduce serious crime is wrong—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's deep feeling, but would he not agree that the figures appear to demonstrate that, by not having capital punishment, we are in the same calculated way condemning a number of other people to die?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think so, because trying to reduce crime or even trying to contain it is very much like playing a game of blind man's buff in a roomful of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0331">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 227</span>
booby traps. Crime statistics are very difficult to interpret, and it is even more difficult to get at the causes. Research has exploded the idea that the roots of crime can be found in isolated causes, such as poverty and broken homes. My right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh East (Mr. Willis) talked about the women who go out to work, poverty and broken homes, but research suggests that the problem has its roots very deep in our society.<br><br>
On the moral aspect, which was covered by the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. Wolrige-Gordon), two obvious trends merit investigation by my right hon. Friend. The main point is the weakening of the built-in social restraints on all kinds of behaviour. Whether we like it or not, we in this Committee cannot get away from our responsibility in this field.<br><br>
The second trend is the increasing opportunity for crime. The statistics of crime would be reduced considerably if, for example, we insisted that anti-theft devices should be fitted on motor cars, or insisted that cheques instead of money should be handed out on a Friday night. The number of thefts of motor cars and of goods from motor cars is quite astronomical and pushes up the criminal statistics. These figures could be reduced if we adopted the right measures but this would not help us in the deeper problems we are concerned about.<br><br>
But, as I said, the main point is the weakening of the social ties. There has been an eating away of the social controls of family and neighbourhood. In my day, it used to be terrible if one heard about a boy being arrested, even for playing football or for breaking a window or for standing at the corner, as many of us had to do as we had nowhere else to go. There must be statistics to prove that the proportion of crimes solved in the county areas is much greater than the number of crimes solved in the great anonymous sprawls of the urban communities, and this has some profound implications. The informal controls, the controls of the family and the neighbourhood, are breaking down, and it may be necessary to strengthen the formal controls. The day is fast approaching when we in this Committee must shift the balance between the protection of individual rights and the protection of society. In that connection, my hon. Friend the Under-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 228</span>
Secretary was involved in a controversy a year ago, regarding pressure to increase police powers of search.<br><br>
We must remember that the criminal process is over-weighted in the direction of the protection of the innocent. No one denies that, and no one would want to weaken it, but, quite often, the police are in an exposed position when they are trying to convict the guilty. But the police are only one element in maintaining law and order. In addition, there are the courts, the prisons, the social services, personnel, equipment and money—and money is what we are dealing with today. It goes without saying that we are short of policemen, and a short-handed police force is an open invitation to the criminal and to crime. So all the more praise is due to the men who are shouldering the burden.<br><br>
But if we had enough police to arrest offenders, where should we put them? My right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East talked about three sleeping in a cell in Barlinnie, and if there is a condemnation to be made of hon. Gentlemen opposite it is that during their long period in Government very little was done to improve the lot of the officers and people who are trying to reform criminals.<br><br>
I have been a manager of three approved schools, and I was very interested in one aspect of the Social Work Bill which my hon. Friend put through the House two years ago. I hope that that Bill will set itself the target of endeavouring to remedy unsatisfactory homes, instead of merely removing the children from those homes. The greatest worry of some of my headmaster friends in the Approved Schools' Association is the great number of boys and girls who should not be there at all. But where is one to put a boy who plays truant or a girl who is outwith parental control? Approved schools and prisons are really incubators of crime, and it is high time that we got into the era of specialised approved schools and prisons. Most of our prisons were built to Victorian penal standards, and they do not measure up to today's standards. We must obviously have maximum security prisons but we ought also to have industrial and social prisons and the same goes for approved schools.<br><br>
12 noon<br><br>
Many of the teachers in the approved schools, and even in the large comprehensive schools, can point out a boy who
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0332">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 229</span>
is going to start in a junior approved school, go on to intermediate and senior approved schools, to borstal, and then ultimately finish in Barlinnie or Peterhead or some other prison. This is where our problem arises. If we could solve the problems in the approved schools we would have gone a long way to solving the much greater problems. A boy goes into an approved school and gets some rudimentary instruction in woodwork, repairing shoes, tailoring and so on. Would it not be possible for the Government, in the new atmosphere alleged to be circulating in trade union circles, to consult the trade unions so that a boy doing joinery, mechanics, bricklaying and so on could have it counted as part and parcel of serving his apprenticeship and have a certificate to that effect? In industry—the new techniques demand that instead of a man serving his time as a joiner or fitter or boilermaker he be trained in multi-crafts, this could start in the approved schools. I know it needs money, buildings and staff. No one denies that offenders should be punished, but for heaven's sake in these enlightened days let them be punished in a constructive way.<br><br>
I would like to finish with one great worry which I have, and I mention it in parentheses, of the boys starting very young in approved schools and finishing as adults in Barlinnie. Most of us must have been astonished, in two recent court cases where serious crimes had been committed, to notice that the offenders had respectively 18 and 16 previous convictions all for serious misdemeanours. Each and every time they were released from prison, because of those thugs, some innocent person suffered. There are two cases in my constituency where two men committed one crime each. Because of their mental condition they are detained in a state institution during Her Majesty's pleasure, but every time these habitual criminals are released from prison they cause acute suffering and sometimes death. I see no good reason why that much earlier in their criminal career they should not have been put out of circulation into a similar institution until they were fit once again to take their place in society.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You will remember, Mr. Robertson, that there were no orchids for Miss Blandish but this morning
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 230</span>
we have been pleased to hear various bouquets presented to the Under-Secretary on the reduction in the number of crimes. He, however, was the first to recognise that it was a very modest reduction, and although we are delighted at any reduction there is still far too much crime. This is something that must go out from this Committee. Why is this? In a short debate like this there is not time to analyse fully the causes of lawlessness. Everyone has his own pet explanation, but what is the right reason? For some it is violence on television, as the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) believes. For others it is the failure of the Church or the school or the parents, and the public attitude as the hon. Gentleman the Member for Glasgow, Springburn (Mr. Buchanan) believes.<br><br>
For myself—and here I do not expect to carry hon. Members of the Committee on the other side with me—I believe the State itself is partly to blame, because the whole tenor of Government today, and particularly under the party at present in power, is to diminish the importance of private rights. When the public see authority riding roughshod over the rights of individuals it is not surprising that while there has been a general decrease in crime there has been a marked increase in crimes against property. The Government act in a lawless fashion. That is what the debate on the Floor of the House this morning is about. The rule of law does not deter them. It is naked power. In these circumstances it is not surprising that individuals act increasingly in an undisciplined and arbitrary way. Perhaps the Government would tell us whether this attitude which is present today has any effect on people.<br><br>
Whatever the cause, what should the cure be? Here, again, everyone has a particular remedy—more police, better prisons and, from the Under-Secretary, further inquiry. Perhaps he is right. His methods, this year at any rate, have produced a small reduction. I have no doubt that all these remedies are helpful in their way, but they seem to fail in one particular. They do not give the ordinary law-abiding citizen a sense of security, nor alleviate the intense sense of outrage which the commission of crimes gives rise to in the breasts of ordinary citizens. In my younger days I had some sympathy with the idealistic approach. The hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Dewar)
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0333">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 231</span>
is one of the exponents of this, of trying to devise ways to reform the criminal, but since I have been a member of Parliament and in close contact with the feelings of my constituencies, I have realised how abhorrent this is to many of them and how strongly they feel that the first priority of Government should not be the reform of the criminal but the protection of society, and, in my view, law abiding citizens are right to feel this. That is why there has been such a demand for harsher penalties. This may not be very charitable, and it may not reduce the number of crimes, but it would give to law-abiding citizens a sense of security, which is markedly lacking today. As legislators we have a real duty to understand and appreciate the atmosphere of apprehension and fear which clouds the lives of many ordinary citizens. We should do all we can to create a sense of stability and security which ordinary people very much desire.<br><br>
In January—it was reported in <i>The Glasgow Herald</i> on 10th January—I received a copy of a letter which Glasgow Corporation sent to the Secretary of State giving the views of the magistrates. I want the Committee to know that I am not expressing only my own views. The magistrates of the City of Glasgow, people dealing with the problem in practical terms, have asked for
<br><blockquote><p>"Reversal of the present trend towards more liberal treatment of convicts".</p></blockquote>
I wonder what sort of reply the Secretary of State sent to that letter. Perhaps the hon. Gentlemen could tell me when he comes to reply, and whether Glasgow Corporation was satisfied with the slightly changed circumstances.<br><br>
I know that many experts believe that harsh penalties will have no effect on the crime rate. This may be part of the truth, but is is not the whole truth, and we make a great mistake if we believe that. When people are on the point of acting irresponsibly they should be aware of the consequences of such action. If, for example, those people who brutally murdered the bus conductor in my constituency in January, or who knifed the relative of the hon. Gentleman the Member for Springburn, had felt, as they were committing the act, that, as a result, they might lose their own lives, I wonder if the action would ever have taken place. People do not so think,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 232</span>
because they know it is not going to matter. Instead of acting as a deterrent and making people pause and think again, modern attitudes to crime encourage an irresponsible, couldn't-care-less attitude, as if society were responsible and not the individual. The hon. Gentleman the Under-Secretary said that today. He talked about social measures and social excuses. It makes me sick when I hear the Under-Secretary say these things. It is always an excuse; it never has anything to do with the person himself.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span> <i>rose</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not going to give way. The hon. Gentleman will have an opportunity to reply later. I am not going to speak for too long.<br><br>
This view of mine is borne out by the action of the party opposite. It instituted the breathalyser and this, coupled with the threat of losing one's licence, has been a most potent deterrent and restraint upon the irresponsible motorist driving after drinking too much. The existence of this severe punishment makes motorists think twice. The aim of the criminal law should be to make the potential criminal, the man or boy who intends to stick a knife into someone, think twice and fear the consequences of not thinking twice.<br><br>
This is what the public is looking to the Government to do. I urge the Government to recognise this, and by word as well as deed to try to bring to the public the sense of security and protection which it is the duty of every Government to provide.</span></p>
<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dempsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In my public service as one of the governors of Barlinnie, Duke Street and Greenock Women's Prisons, and as a magistrate enforcing the law laid down by the House of Commons, I have always believed that the most effective thing against crime was an efficient police force. That should be the object of all Governments, irrespective of party, and for that reason it gives me special pleasure to congratulate my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary on the facts, figures and statistics he has given indicating the strength of the force and how it is being equipped and the new methods being used to prevent crime.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0334">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 233</span>
In this life we can have only what we pay for, and it looks as if we can only complete the establishment of the police when we make salaries and conditions of employment sufficiently attractive.<br><br>
It is well known that people with no experience like that of police officers are earning far better wages than are the police at present. For instance, lorry drivers who work a little overtime are earning £23 to £25 a week and they are not long-distance drivers. People in factories are earning £23 to £25 a week. Police officers also work overtime, being called out for special parades and sporting events on Saturdays and Sundays and they have to replace others in cases of sickness. A police officer gives up his social and home life to enforce law in our society. I have always taken the view that till this is sufficiently recognised we will not build up the approved establishment we would like. Having said that, I congratulate the Under-Secretary on his efforts to recruit officers to the police forces throughout Scotland.<br><br>
Another step which could be taken is that of additional promotion opportunity. I undertand there are ranks of sergeant, inspector, chief inspector, superintendent grade II, superintendent grade I, chief superintendent, deputy chief constable and chief constable, but at the bottom there is a gap between the ordinary constable and the sergeant. We have people who join the police force and give first class service walking the beat for years without recognition, because there are not enough vacancies. An old-head is valuable to the new recruit and the probationer, and this should be recognised by a new grade between constable and sergeant. Would the Under-Secretary consider this and, if he feels like it, discuss it with chief constables at a future meeting?<br><br>
I would like to indicate our appreciation to the police for their services. I will not say that they are all idols. We have undesirables in the police force as well as anywhere else. From my youth hostelling days I always recall the hostel not far from Glasgow where one was scared to put down a bottle of milk—there are black sheep everywhere; they have been found in the police force and in Parliament, too. The main problem in this is not the few bad policemen but the bulk of the public who will not co-operate.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 234</span>
To the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie)—I do not know whether he is going to speaktoday or not—I would say that the one reason they cannot get the public to co-operate is that they are afraid of the trials. If a defendant is being defended witnesses may be made to look fools in the witness box by smart aleck solicitors out to make a pound or two from anything. That is why one cannot get doctors to accidents. They visualise the hours which they will spend waiting in a court, and the time spent on the witness stand, professional medical men, often being made to look fools.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would not the learned hon. Gentleman agree that the difficulty which the courts have often found about getting citizens to give evidence is not fear of cross-examination but fear of reprisal by friends of the accused? This is a very real problem.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dempsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot accept that. Only recently I imposed stiff fines on neighbours of mine and when I went home I expected to find them waiting on the bend of the road for me, but they accept that penalties have to be imposed by those appointed to impose them. It may be that some nice roses in gardens may be destroyed. That sort of thing can happen, but not to any great extent where witnesses are called for cross-examination.<br><br>
As someone with long experience of police courts I say that the main fear is appearing in the witness box and being made almost to look a fool and being taken down by smart aleck chaps out to make a pound or two. If the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands contests this I invite him to talk to some of the doctors who refuse to appear when they are called to road accident cases. They will give him the reason they dodge. We should appeal to the legal profession to be responsible in its attitude to individuals willing to go and do their duty for the sake of authority and maintaining law and order in the community.<br><br>
I was impressed by the number of police radios now in circulation. This is one of the most desirable pieces of equipment any officer can have. It is now possible, for the first time, for an officer to take a lonely beat in the midst of a quarter where physical damage might be done to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0335">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 235</span>
him. I know of a case of a brave young officer who was attacked by six hooligans. As he fell to the ground he was able to call for assistance on his radio. Had help not arrived, the officer would have been in a sorry mess. The personal radio is one of the finest gadgets ever introduced into the police service. My hon. Friend should make it his ambition to ensure that every officer on the beat has that safeguard by which he can call for help when he needs it.<br><br>
It is the few who make laws for the many. It is the few who create the need for a police force and compel us to provide prisons, and we should pay some tribute to the noble and responsible members of the community who do their utmost to co-operate with the police force to ensure that we shall have law and order in our lifetime.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the mother of three young children and as one engaged in criminal law practice for many years, very often in juvenile courts, I would like to start by talking about juvenile offenders. I am sure that on this subject I may find myself in agreement, largely, with the views of the Under-Secretary, for whom, on this matter, I have admiration. In his opening speech he mentioned 21 years as the age for the "umbrella". My view is that that age should be retained and should not be lower. For this reason, that it does not seem to me unreasonable that, before 21, the dominant aim should be to retrieve the offender. It is still likely that an offender younger than that can be retrieved. I would like 18 for every other purpose but that we should retain 21 for the protective umbrella, and make retrieval the main purpose. I do not believe in the doctrine of original sin; I do not think some children start out as wicked children, predestined to a life of crime.<br><br>
I was interested in the remarks of the Under-Secretary about the importance of looking at the early offender in the approved school setting. However, that may be too late and it may be necessary to catch them at a much earlier age, as the crucial age. Lord Birsay was right when he said that by the time a child was six years old it was often too late and that then the pattern of deviation from the norm had started, presumably because
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 236</span>
of background experience. The inevitability of certain criminal patterns of behaviour is something which any experienced criminal lawyer could pick out. In some cases one could say that an offender is almost certain to graduate to approved school, senior approved school, borstal, and then to become an old lag. If crime is rooted in early life, then one is brought back to reliance on the doctrine of original sin which one surely cannot have in this day.<br><br>
Many thousands of accused in the under 21 age group, it seems to me, if they had a stable relationship with parents or even one parent or a granny, would only rarely turn to this unstable pattern. The trouble with many children is that they have not a stable relationship. I could break hon. Members' hearts by relating sad experiences, but I remember particularly one young adolescent girl weeping as she was taken to an approved school. Her mother was a prostitute. What was the sheriff to do but to send her to an approved school? Was it the girl who should have appeared in court? So often I feel it should be the parents who should be there, and perhaps their parents before them. Any work done on the causes of crime along these lines must be important and cannot be regarded as money wasted. I am not convinced that the latchkey mother is culpable. To me the culpable one is the mother who fails to provide the child with a normal home. A home can stand a certain amount of violence, but often there is too much, and too often people outside do not know about it. Trouble occurs when the child knows that father has already been in Barlinnie. Does one accept that not much can be done by slinging around large sums of money to cure the problems of young children, and that it is more the lack of stability?<br><br>
The question of jobs is crucial in retrieving boys who have been to borstal. What hope is there for a boy who cannot get a job even though he has had some kind of training? Anything done by way of legislation to encourage the possibility of young men getting a job would be useful. I had a borstal boy as a client who had won the Duke of Edinburgh's Award. He had the decency to say that I was not to use the fact in court on any account. A boy like that should be retrieved. He was out of borstal in a few weeks and trying to get a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0336">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 237</span>
job, but he broke into a factory—where there was no money; it was just for the adventure. Walter MacGowan's father said to me, "Give me a vandal and I will make him an excellent athlete". A boy who has been a vandal is a boy who, whatever his faults, will have a lot of energy. It seems to me that there is a moral in that story, and in the fact that a country like Finland huge sums have been spent on facilities and free training in any sport for the delinquent age group which causes so much concern.<br><br>
12.30 p.m.<br><br>
In my view, violence begets violence. Even although I am against censorship generally I would be in favour of restricted viewing of television at those hours when children may be expected to watch. Incidentally, it is all kinds of violence which beget violence. I believe that those loud voices clamouring to bring back the birch and to bring back hanging, which is a violent way of thinking, encourage the commission of other violent crimes.<br><br>
I will not raise the issue of capital punishment because that would be a talk in itself, but as my life so far has been spent working in courts I do know that courts are places where human errors occur in just the same way as they do in other places, and that alone would be a sufficient argument against capital punishment, quite apart from all the moral arguments which weigh more deeply with me. It is odd that there are no famous thinkers or philosophers in favour of capital punishment. The same speeches are made today in the House of Lords as have been made each time the subject of capital punishment has been raised. If one goes back to the time when capital punishment was abolished for the stealing of vegetables—whenever that was—the same speech was made then in the House of Lords, that it would be the end of society. That speech is still being made in the House of Lords today.<br><br>
Referring to the subject of sharper prison sentences, in my view they are of little use, either as a deterrent or for reformatory purposes. Does prison deter? Does it stop the housebreaker only when he is in prison or does it stop him altogether? Ask any procurator fiscal or any solicitor with experience in criminal practice and he will say that on the whole it just keeps the man out of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 238</span>
circulation. However there is a backlash involved in putting people into prison. A three-months' sentence does not keep a person out of circulation for long, but it presents a backlash problem for society. The first time a man goes to prison is the worst. He feels the degradation in the eyes of his wife and children and he is not the same person in his own eyes. But the second time he goes to prison is not so bad. So take away that sanction of the first prison sentence and we may be wasting our time. Another point is that we introduce him to other criminal types, probably of a worse character. In my view, if prison is to be regarded as our main solution to the problem we should find an alternative to the short prison sentence.<br><br>
I am interested in probation orders, and, in my view, this is something which should be encouraged. The idea that punishment should fit the crime is an old one. Is it not much better to tell the habitual nuisance at the football match that every Saturday afternoon he must be at the police station? It might be more trouble for the policeman, but I believe it would get to the root of the problem. There are sheriffs in Glasgow who have this attitude to punishment, which I think is quite right. I know of one case of a boy who, with the co-operation of the headmaster, was made to apologise to the whole assembled school for his wrongdoing. That boy did not like that punishment. People may laugh at a sheriff who selects that punishment, but I do not laugh at it.<br><br>
Excellent experiments are being carried out at the present time in which the police are trying to liaise with the community in Greenock. I think possibly not enough has been done along these lines. After all, the policemen are familiar to children and to young people. Along with my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Hugh D. Brown) I have been engaged in an experiment which has received probably far too much publicity, but it is better than merely shaking our heads in despair. We must tackle the problem.<br><br>
Turning to legal aid, in my view there is far too much criticism of the working of this scheme. The legal profession never received praise before, but now we seem to get more than our share of criticism. Sir Winston Churchill once said that the hallmark of a civilised society was, that it gave proper opportunities for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0337">Image</span>

defence to its people. One cannot do one's job when one knows that the scales of justice are weighed against the accused. It is generally said that the scales of justice are weighted against the Crown, but they are actually weighted against the accused. First of all, the defence cannot compel witnesses to attend for questioning. Secondly, the defence has no access to criminal record of witnesses in the case, and, of course, there is a lack of funds for medical and other technical evidence, though on the last item legal aid has redressed the balance.<br><br>
I will not take up the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge and Airdrie (Mr. Dempsey) about witnesses. Many witnesses in Glasgow are genuinely afraid to give evidence for fear of reprisals. Often a doctor is not willing to attend court because he is usually kept waiting unnecessarily, sometimes for days, and it is the fault of the Crown who do not telephone him to tell him when he is needed.<br><br>
I should also like to add a brief note on a different subject and say that there is no reason why our Law Officers in Scotland should get much lower salaries than the English Law Officers. There is no possible reason for the disparity between £13,000 paid to the Attorney-General in England and £8,000 paid to the Attorney-General in Scotland, or the £9,000 paid to the English Solicitor-General and the £5,625 paid to the Scottish Solicitor-General. I have already raised this matter. There is no reason for the disparity and the injustice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will not follow the line on which the hon. Lady the Member for Hamilton (Mrs. Ewing) has just concluded her speech, because I am not really sure whether that is strictly relevant to this discussion.<br><br>
A year ago, on 9th May, the Under-Secretary began his speech in this way:
<br><blockquote><p>"The attendance this morning illustrates something else, too: the very genuine concern held by all sections of the community about this question at the present time."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>Scottish Grand Committee,</i> 9th May, 1968; c. 123.]</p></blockquote>
I think probably one could say the same thing today. The attendance in this Committee this morning has shown the concern which we all feel for this problem.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 240</span>
If anything is to be said about the tone of the last debate—and I am not sure that the Minister was justified in his comment—it is important to remember that a year ago the debate took place against the background of an appalling rise in crimes of violence against the person. As the Under-Secretary mentioned, the year 1967 saw a rise of something in the region of 20 per cent. in this category of crime, which reached an all-time level of 3,535 cases, and it would have been odd indeed if concern had not been expressed a year ago in the light of that situation. Today we have heard a lot about a decline in the rise of the level of crime. It is important to remember that so far as this category of crime is concerned the figures for 1968 which have recently been published and to which the Under-Secretary made reference, in fact show that last year we reached an all-time record in that category, so as he quite properly said, this is not a matter about which we should feel in any way complacent: 3,586 crimes against the person known to the police should really shock all of us and cause us the utmost concern. I join with those who expressed some relief—and one cannot put it higher than that—that the appalling rise in recent years has not been repeated this year——</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. and learned Friend aware that this very morning, I believe, no fewer than 10 people have been shot by a suspected murderer in Glasgow, resisting arrest? Is this not an indication of the seriousness of crimes against the person?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith) is right in emphasising the gravity of this type of offence. However, naturally we are concerned with all categories of crime and my hon. Friend the Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Gordon Campbell) properly pointed out our concern in relation to crimes against property, but I have always taken the view, and most people here would share it, that crimes against the person are the most serious forms of crime, and it is with these that we are properly concerned.<br><br>
In the short time at my disposal I would like merely to endorse the remark made by my hon. Friend about the need and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0338">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 241</span>
desirability of making the maximum use of technical aids in relation to crime prevention. I was glad to notice in paragraph 108 of the recently published report by the Chief Inspector of Constabularies in Scotland that operational experience has now amply proved that personal wireless is probably the greatest aid to police work in modern times. This point was made by the hon. Member for Coatbridge and Airdrie (Mr. Dempsey), and I was glad to hear what the Minister had to say about the increasing use of this type of aid.<br><br>
There is another possible solution to the problem of police staffing, establishment, and so on—this was referred to by the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis)—namely, to relieve the police so far as possible from road traffic work, which is really not the kind of thing for which a police force is primarily intended. Dealing with statutory offences of that kind imposes a tremendous strain on the police and is responsible for such strained relationships as exist between the police and the public. I would like to see much wider use made of traffic wardens. From one's personal observation in Edinburgh, it is obvious that increasing use is being made of wardens, and I believe this is also so in Glasgow, and it is to be hoped that this development will continue.<br><br>
Much has been said about the whole question of prison conditions. Accusations have been made from the other side of the Committee about the record of the Conservative Government in the 1950s and the early 1960s. I think it is only fair to remember that the problem of crime in its present context is something which has developed in a most marked fashion only over relatively recent years. I am sure the Minister recognises that. One only needs to look at the figures for crimes of violence against the person from 1963 until the present time. That is an increase from something substantially over 2,000 a year in 1963 to over 3,500 a year in 1968.<br><br>
12.45 p.m.<br><br>
Although one cannot and ought never at any time to be complacent about the problems facing prison officers and problems of prison accommodation, I do not believe that the problem of overcrowding in prisons was anything like as acute
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 242</span>
ten or fifteen years ago as it is today; and today it is very acute. I am not accusing the Government of sitting back and doing nothing. From what the Minister has said I believe, on the contrary, that he has done all that he possibly can, but it is right to draw attention to the problem, and to express concern as to what is to happen if the level of crime, and the present level in particular, remains at its current level and the present sentencing policy, which I believe is necessary and desirable, is persisted in.<br><br>
The other day the Minister kindly gave me figures in relation to accommodation in the sense of intended and actual occupation. At the end of June, Barlinnie, which was intended to accommodate 782 prisoners, was accommodating 1,104. In Edinburgh, my own constituency, the prison, which was built to accommodate 349 prisoners, was accommodating on 24th June, 555. The same thing applies to young offenders' institutions. That at Barlinnie, which was intended to accommodate 188, now accommodates 331; and Edinburgh, intended to accommodate 157, now holds 206. This presents serious problems for prison staffs as well as making much more difficult the question of rehabilitation.<br><br>
I do not believe, nor do I think does the Minister believe, that the solution is a change in the present sentencing policy. In my respectful submission, that policy in recent years has done more than anything else to contain the rise in crime and to drive home the lesson, reflecting as it does the public view, that crime must not be allowed to appear to pay. I believe in particular that the High Court sentencing policy in recent years has been thoroughly commendable. I know that people hold genuinely opposed views on this question. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) and the hon. Member for Glasgow, Springburn (Mr. Buchanan), expressed the view that the sentencing policy has to do more than take into account simply the deterrent effect and the personal conditions and circumstances of the individual; and ought also, in a sense, to reflect the public feeling—"public outrage" was the term used by my hon. Friend—at the nature of the offence. Perhaps I may quote the evidence of the noble and learned Lord Denning, in his statement to the Gowers Commission on Capital Punishment some years ago:
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0339">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 243</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"The punishment for grave crime ought adequately to reflect the revulsion felt by a majority of citizens. It is a mistake to consider the object of punishment as being deterrent or reformative or preventive and nothing else. The ultimate justification of any punishment is not that it is a deterrent but that it is the emphatic denunciation by the community of a crime."</p></blockquote>
In the last year or so the sentencing policy has, I believe, tended to reflect the disgust and annoyance of society at the growing level of violent crime; and I hope that so long as that level of crime is even approaching its present level that policy will be maintained.<br><br>
We have had an interesting debate, and I believe the Committee is particularly indebted to my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart for the speech he made, with his close knowledge of police work and police problems. I do not think one can disregard the point he made and the figures he produced as to the effect of capital punishment. This is something which should be looked into very carefully. My own views are fairly well known, and I do not wish to rehearse them now; but although one cannot relate the abolition of the death penalty in a limited sense to all the changes, the case he made is a serious one which cannot be ignored.<br><br>
The right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East asked whether sheriffs visit prisons. My understanding is that sheriffs have been inside detention centres. I agree that if they have not been it is desirable that they should, but it is also important to bear in mind that the courts have to remember—and this applies particularly to lower courts and more especially to magistrates' courts—that what may be in itself a relatively petty or minor offence, physically may have on the victim an effect which is not always readily understood by the presiding magistrate.<br><br>
I will conclude with a personal experience. About six months ago, or perhaps rather longer, I was returning home from a late night Sitting with my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Wright), who, unfortunately, has to be elsewhere today—[<i>Laughter</i>]. He is up in the far north making a visit. There was adequate lighting but Whitehall was virtually empty. We were both stopped by a couple of youths who made a request for money. After this was refused the next thing I knew was that I was lying on my back on the road. If
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 244</span>
either of those youths had had an offensive weapon the consequences might have been very serious. I do not mind admitting I was upset for several days afterwards because of this experience. How much more upsetting would such an experience be for a young or elderly woman or an elderly man. That is an aspect of crimes of violence which the courts must never overlook. In cases of that type salutary sentences are the only solution.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: During the debate there were moments which were positively embarrassing. Perhaps hon. Members are being too pleased about the figures, in the same way as, I believe, they were too despondent about the figures last year. Certainly, I did not entirely accept guilt for the figures last year, nor do I accept the credit for them this year. I have always asserted that the handling of crime and criminal problems in our society is a complex and multifarious task. Sometimes it is due to a combination of causes and requires a combination of treatments. Certainly, happy as I have been, as Under-Secretary of State, to get the credit, I must say that that credit must go to the police, the courts, and all the agencies who have been involved.<br><br>
A second difficulty is the rapid change in the situation. The figures last year dominated the debate. The improvement this year has dominated this debate. Yet this morning's news from Glasgow, as indicated by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith) suggests that we cannot rest content so long as even one such incident occurs. My information, in which hon. Members will be interested, is that a gunman has been running amok in Glasgow this morning and a number of people have been injured, though so far as we know at the moment no one is dead. The number of people involved is not known exactly. An arrest has been made. Further details are still coming in,</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Could I tell the hon. Gentleman that I understand that a gunman has been killed—shot dead—in Springburn?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can only give the Committee information which is as up to date as possible and I am giving the Committee information which has come from Glasgow Police Headquarters. Just as I dislike
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I0340">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 245</span>
instant policy making in terms of figures, I do not like instant decisions oft the basis of a report of this kind.<br><br>
In the short period available I have not time to deal with all the points that have been raised. The hon. Lady the Member for Hamilton (Mrs. Ewing) has sent me an extremely pleasant note of apology saying she was not aware that she was dipping into my time. For that she apologises to the Committee and to myself—an example of the sunshine that appears to be shining on me from all directions, sometimes unusual ones.<br><br>
The most important theoretical point that arose was that in connection with murder statistics. As the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) knows, I have never liked the numbers game, and I do not believe that it is really valid in this connection either. But two things are clear. One is that most of the rise in the number of murders has been due to the increase in the number of crimes of violence. That is to say, the normal, traditional—if that is the correct term—domestic type of murder does not seem to have varied in number. The increase in the number of murders has arisen out of brawls and assaults. The point about which we have to worry and on which we have to concentrate is violence rather than the murder aspect. We should turn our attention to that. Our attitude gets distorted when we are emotively concerned with the death penalty. It has to be remembered that a distance of only one-quarter of an inch may mean the difference between assault and murder; it may be even a case of a thin skull.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 246</span>
The hon. Gentleman related the increase to figures between 1946 and 1957 in order to tie his argument up with the Act of 1957, but if such small numbers are valid at all—and I do not believe that figures on this scale are valid—between 1946 and 1957 the figure was 14.4 per year; and between 1957 and 1963 the murder average was 14.3 per year—just below. But if the hon. Gentleman had added one year to this period, to make it cover 1957 to 1964, the average would have been 15.4 a year—just above. In other words, there is very little indication that the point on which the hon. Gentleman concentrated has had the effect in terms of the murder rate of which he speaks. This is a matter which can best be discussed when the House of Commons in full discusses it; because Orders have to be laid at some point to continue the present position, or otherwise.<br><br>
A number of specific questions were raised on the necessity for research and for understanding the causes. We have considerably increased the amount being spent. At present something of the order of twice as much is now being spent, mainly on research. One of the things which has limited me has been not only finance but getting the right kind of research people——</span></p>
